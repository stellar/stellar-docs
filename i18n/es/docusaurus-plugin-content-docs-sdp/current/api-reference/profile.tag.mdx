Profiles endpoints manage the process of getting and updating individual profile information. Profile information is set when the account is created and can be updated by the user on the SDP dashboard Profile page. Note: profiles never refer to receivers of funds.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
