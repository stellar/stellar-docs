A cross-contract invocation is a powerful (yet expensive) kind of contract interaction. A contract invocation is similar to starting a new process because the code that runs will be in a separate address space, meaning that they do not share any data other than what was passed in the invocation. While a contract invocation typically transfers control to a _different_ contract, it is possible to transfer control to the currently running contract. Regardless of whether the contract that receives control is a different contract or the currently running contract, the value returned by `get_invoking_contract` will be the previous value of `get_current_contract`. A contract invocation can only access the public methods of a contract.

If a contract contains a public function `f`, then invoking `f` can be done by making a Rust function call to `f::invoke`.

Some contracts, such as the token contract, only export the contract invocation functions. In doing so, they are able to assign those functions friendly names. For example, [initialize](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/contract.rs#L55-L57)

```rust
#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl TokenTrait for Token {
    fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, decimal: u32, name: Binary, symbol: Binary) {
```

is [exported](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/lib.rs#L26) as

```rust
pub use crate::contract::initialize::invoke as initialize;
```

This function is then easily [called by the liquidity pool contract](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/4060d3bd5ee7846020b68ee583665a4d4cf4b315/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs#L164-L171).
