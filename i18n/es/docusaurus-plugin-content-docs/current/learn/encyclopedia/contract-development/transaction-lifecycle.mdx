See [GH issue #532](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-docs/issues/532) for details.

We're getting a lot of questions that relate to the transaction lifecycle and don't have a great resource to send people to.

The regular Stellar resources are confusing because:

1. they don't have any information on preflight and
2. soroban-rpc's tx submission is async
