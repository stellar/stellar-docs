Stellar Core is the program nodes use to communicate with other nodes to create and maintain the Stellar peer-to-peer network. It's an implementation of the Stellar Consensus Protocol configured to construct a chain of ledgers guaranteed to be in agreement across all participating nodes at all times.

These pages describe various aspects of installing, configuring, and maintaining a `stellar-core` node.
