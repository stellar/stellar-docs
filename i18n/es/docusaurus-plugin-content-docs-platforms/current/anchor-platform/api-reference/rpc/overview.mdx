JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.

It's simple and easy to use, as it uses a single HTTP endpoint and a JSON object that contains the method name and parameters.
It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over http, or in many various message passing environments.
It uses [JSON](http://www.json.org/) ([RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)) as data format.

:::note

All member names exchanged between the Client and the Server that are considered for matching of any kind should be considered to be case-sensitive.
