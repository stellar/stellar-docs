# SDF Platforms

SDF has open-sourced some "platforms" that make it easier to accomplish certain things on the network.

## Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is a set of tools and APIs that enable developers and businesses to build their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network. It provides a standardized interface, including the implementation of several Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), to make it easy for businesses to integrate with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.

The Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP) enables organizations to disburse bulk payments to recipients using Stellar.
