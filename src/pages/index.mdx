# Welcome

Stellar is a layer-1 open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network that provides a framework for developers to create applications, issue assets, write smart contracts, and connect to existing financial rails. Stellar is designed to enable creators, innovators, and developers to build projects on the network that can interoperate with each other.

These docs will teach you how to build applications, issue and use tokens, write smart contracts, set up on and off-ramps, set up a validator node, and more.

If you can’t find answers to your questions in the docs, search for your answer or ask questions in our [Stellar Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev) or [Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com/).

### Smart contracts

Smart contracts on Stellar launched on Mainnet following a successful validator vote on February 20th, 2024. Stellar's smart contract platform includes the smart contract environment, a Rust SDK, a CLI, and an RPC server.

This section details how to get started by writing a Hello World contract, then dives deeper into smart contracts on Stellar with various example contracts and how-to guides. Also, learn how to use Stellar assets in smart contracts with the Stellar Asset Contract or how to create your own smart contract token.
