# Welcome to Stellar Developer Docs

Stellar is a layer-1, open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network. Developers use its framework to create applications, issue assets, write smart contracts, and connect to existing financial rails. Further, the network lets creators, innovators, and developers build projects that can interoperate with each other, for everyone.

The developer docs explain how to build applications, issue and use tokens, write smart contracts, set up on- and off-ramps, set up a validator node, and much more.
