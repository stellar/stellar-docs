This challenge will guide you through the process of building and shipping a crowdfunding dapp on Stellar using Soroban. Unlike traditional crowdfunding applications, crowdfunding dapps (decentralized applications) provide the means for users to pledge funds to a crowdfund campaign directly from their digital wallets, without the need for intermediaries.

In this challenge, you will learn how to deploy smart contracts to Futurenet, and how to interact with them through a web frontend. In this context, the term "ship" refers to finalizing the development process of your dapp, ensuring that it functions as expected, and is accessible for user interaction and testing through a hosted frontend. However, it's crucial to clarify that despite its functionality, the dapp is not promoted nor intended for deployment in a production-level setting on Futurenet. The challenge is designed for educational purposes, helping you understand how a dapp can be built and interacted with, with further customization and development, it has the potential to evolve into a full-fledged, ready-to-use crowdfunding solution.

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Install 📚

Start by installing the required dependencies. You'll also want to be sure you have the most updated version of Rust installed.

Required:

- `soroban-cli alias` (installed in the next step)
- `Node` v18: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

First, clone the Soroban Dapps Challenge repo and check out the `crowdfund` branch, which contains the code for the crowdfund smart contract that powers this dapp:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge.git
cd soroban-dapps-challenge
git checkout crowdfund
```

Then, install soroban-cli alias by running the following command:

```sh
cargo install_soroban
```

Soroban CLI is the command line interface to Soroban. It allows you to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts, configure identities, generate key pairs, manage networks, and more. The soroban-cli (alias) that is used in this challenge is a pinned version of the soroban-cli that is used in the Soroban Dapps Challenge. This ensures that the challenge is reproducible and that all participants are using the same version of Soroban.

## Checkpoint 1: 🎬 Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that you have the Crowdfund branch checked out, it's time to deploy the smart contracts to a Sandbox environment. Deploying a smart contract in a production setting involves submitting the contract code to the blockchain's main network ( Mainnet ), where it becomes part of the chain's immutable ledger. Deploying smart contracts to a Sandbox environment simulates that process without actually affecting Mainnet. When you deploy the smart contracts, you'll instead deploy to Futurenet, a test network with more cutting-edge features that have not yet been implemented in the Mainnet.

In your terminal, load the contracts and initialize them in the Sandbox environment by running the following commands:

```sh
npm run setup
```

If the command runs successfully, your terminal will return a series of messages notifying you about the successful initialization of the contracts and the post-installation sequence.

```sh
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBXHU5BWWTOCZRYX3DMSSKCFG7B3K2YG2I5F75ALPQ6GCY6ZES2XKLTI
Deploy the crowdfund contract
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBKY7UN5VGD4LIQFOBOTSUSQWK67BZZTA23NIEVWSWRR5SAT26JQN2BN
Initialize the abundance token contract

Initialize the crowdfund contract

Done

> soroban-example-dapp@0.1.0 build-contracts
...
```

The contract ID is a unique identifier for a smart contract deployed on a blockchain. This contract ID is used to interact with and reference the smart contract, allowing users to invoke functions from the smart contract, send transactions, or otherwise interact with the smart contract's functionalities and data stored on the blockchain.

:::tip

Please, save your deployed contract ID. You will need it to complete the challenge.

## Checkpoint 2: 🤝 Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Now that you have deployed the smart contract, it's time to check out the frontend of your dapp. The frontend is the browser interface where contributors to your crowdfund campaign will connect their digital wallets and pledge assets to the campaign's cause.

First, start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should be able to see the frontend of your dapp.

> Note: Follow the instructions below and ensure that you have funded your wallet address that you intend to use from browser, otherwise the dapp display will be blank an 'Account not found' will be printed on browser's console only.

Now that you have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with the backend, your smart contract, that defines the rules and logic of the crowdfund campaign, including the function for accepting contributions. If you want to dig into the specifics of the contract, take a look at the video walkthrough of the contract code [here](https://youtu.be/vTz0CQYnMRQ?t=260&feature=shared).

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your wallet to interact with the dapp. Visit https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet, and follow the instructions to create and or fund an account on Futurenet. Remember, these are test lumens for use on Futurenet and cannot be used on Mainnet.

## Checkpoint 3: 🌟 Powering the Campaign

Fuel the vision! In this step, you will learn how to mint tokens and fund the crowdfunding campaign. Minting tokens in a crowdfund dapp, while not always required, serves as a bootstrapping mechanism for the campaign, allowing the campaign to be funded with the minted tokens.

<Tabs defaultValue="mint" values={[
    {label: '🏦 Mint Tokens', value: 'mint'},
    {label: '💰 Fund the Campaign', value: 'fund'},
]}>

<TabItem value="mint">

<Tabs defaultValue="openDapp" values={[
    {label: 'Mint', value: 'openDapp'},
    {label: 'Approve', value: 'approveTx'},
    {label: 'Check', value: 'checkBalance'},
]}>

<TabItem value="openDapp">

#### Open Dapp and Mint

Open the dapp frontend and click on the "Mint 100 ABND" button.

<img src={mintToken} className="image-style" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="approveTx">

#### Approve Transaction

You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction. Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

## Checkpoint 4: 🚢 Ship it! 🚁

Now that your dapp is fully functional, its time to deploy it to a production environment. In this step, you will learn how to deploy your dapp to Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites that offers a quick and effective way to deploy the frontend of your dapp. This section requires that you have a [Vercel account] and the Vercel cli installed.

If you don't have the Vercel cli installed, run the following command to install it globally:

```sh
npm i --global vercel
```

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

Next, you will need to remove the `target` directory to save space for the the deployment. Run the following command to remove the `target` directory:

```sh
rm -rf target
```

> Note: You can build this directory again by running `soroban contract build` in the `contracts/abundance` directory.

Then, remove any existing `.vercel` directory in your project to ensure that you are starting with a clean slate:

```bash
rm -rf .vercel
```

Then, run the following command to deploy your example dapp:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Vercel will prompt you to link your local project to a new Vercel project. Follow the answers to the prompts below to ensure that your local project is correctly linked to a new Vercel project:

```bash
? Set up “~/Documents/GitHub/test/soroban-dapps-challenge”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope should contain your project? <VERCEL_UNAME>
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? <PROJECT_NAME>
? In which directory is your code located? ./
```

Then, continue through the prompts (you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
🔗  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
✅  Production: https://soroban-example-dapp-rho.vercel.app [42s]
```

:::tip

Please, save your production url, you will need it to complete the challenge.
