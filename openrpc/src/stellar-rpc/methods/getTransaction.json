    "description": "The getTransaction method provides details about the specified transaction. Clients are expected to periodically query this method to ascertain when a transaction has been successfully recorded on the blockchain. The stellar-rpc system maintains a restricted history of recently processed transactions, with the default retention window set at 24 hours. For private soroban-rpc instances, it is possible to modify the retention window value by adjusting the transaction-retention-window configuration setting, but we do not recommend values longer than 7 days. For debugging needs that extend beyond this timeframe, it is advisable to index this data yourself, employ a third-party [indexer](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/data-indexers), or query [Hubble](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/hubble) (our public BigQuery data set).",
