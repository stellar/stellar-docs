    "description": "The getTransaction method provides details about the specified transaction. Clients are expected to periodically query this method to ascertain when a transaction has been successfully recorded on the blockchain. The soroban-rpc system maintains a restricted history of recently processed transactions, with the default retention window set at 1440 ledgers, approximately equivalent to a 2-hour timeframe. For private soroban-rpc instances, it is possible to modify the retention window value by adjusting the transaction-retention-window configuration setting. For comprehensive debugging needs that extend beyond the 2-hour timeframe, it is advisable to retrieve transaction information from Horizon, as it provides a lasting and persistent record.",
