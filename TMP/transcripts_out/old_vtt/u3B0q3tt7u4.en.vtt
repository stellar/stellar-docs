oh so that that would allow you to sign

I<00:18:38.629><c> mean</c><00:18:38.749><c> signups</c><00:18:39.619><c> are</c><00:18:39.799><c> typically</c><00:18:40.159><c> a</c><00:18:40.309><c> very</c>

00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:40.369 align:start position:0%
I mean signups are typically a very


00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
I mean signups are typically a very

00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:45.139 align:start position:0%

00:18:45.139 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
service and so that's I think when you
do<00:18:45.289><c> create</c><00:18:45.559><c> account</c><00:18:45.830><c> I</c><00:18:46.009><c> guess</c><00:18:46.399><c> maybe</c><00:18:46.580><c> you</c><00:18:46.730><c> do</c>

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:46.850 align:start position:0%
do create account I guess maybe you do


00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
do create account I guess maybe you do
create<00:18:47.059><c> account</c><00:18:47.419><c> during</c><00:18:47.629><c> escrow</c><00:18:48.049><c> operations</c>

00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:48.649 align:start position:0%

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
create account during escrow operations
as<00:18:49.279><c> well</c><00:18:49.549><c> so</c><00:18:50.509><c> I'll</c><00:18:50.600><c> make</c><00:18:50.720><c> it</c><00:18:50.869><c> might</c><00:18:51.019><c> make</c><00:18:51.139><c> a</c>

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
as well so I'll make it might make a


00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
as well so I'll make it might make a

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.210 align:start position:0%
trickier but I don't know my take is


00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
trickier but I don't know my take is

things the way they are and so sure this
maybe<00:19:00.320><c> means</c><00:19:00.799><c> that</c><00:19:00.950><c> you</c><00:19:01.009><c> need</c><00:19:01.129><c> a</c><00:19:01.190><c> hundred</c>

maybe means that you need a hundred

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:43.570 align:start position:0%
existing complex in here so yeah it's


00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.560 align:start position:0%

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:46.570 align:start position:0%
not really new complexity also I think


00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.649 align:start position:0%

00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:38.619 align:start position:0%
John said I think that this specific

John said I think that this specific

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
problem doesn't actually relate to cap


00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.070 align:start position:0%
problem doesn't actually relate to cap
33<00:20:41.889><c> it's</c><00:20:42.039><c> more</c><00:20:42.309><c> of</c><00:20:42.399><c> a</c><00:20:42.490><c> general</c><00:20:42.700><c> store</c><00:20:43.659><c> problem</c>

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
33 it's more of a general store problem


00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.019 align:start position:0%
33 it's more of a general store problem
so<00:20:44.259><c> maybe</c><00:20:44.470><c> trying</c><00:20:45.249><c> to</c><00:20:45.340><c> solve</c><00:20:45.519><c> for</c><00:20:45.700><c> this</c><00:20:45.820><c> right</c>

we're<00:22:07.899><c> fighting</c><00:22:08.200><c> all</c><00:22:08.350><c> the</c><00:22:08.470><c> time</c><00:22:09.120><c> and</c><00:22:10.120><c> then</c>

00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:10.299 align:start position:0%
we're fighting all the time and then


00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:11.310 align:start position:0%
we're fighting all the time and then
that<00:22:10.450><c> and</c><00:22:10.630><c> then</c><00:22:10.720><c> the</c><00:22:10.809><c> plan</c><00:22:10.990><c> would</c><00:22:11.140><c> be</c><00:22:11.200><c> to</c>

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
that and then the plan would be to


00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
that and then the plan would be to
create<00:22:11.799><c> some</c><00:22:12.130><c> sort</c><00:22:12.250><c> of</c><00:22:12.340><c> group</c><00:22:12.580><c> to</c><00:22:12.909><c> solve</c><00:22:13.419><c> this</c>

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:13.630 align:start position:0%
create some sort of group to solve this

but from what I understand this cap cap


00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.049 align:start position:0%
but from what I understand this cap cap
33<00:22:19.240><c> we</c><00:22:19.419><c> could</c><00:22:19.870><c> move</c><00:22:20.110><c> on</c><00:22:20.350><c> to</c><00:22:20.669><c> final</c><00:22:21.669><c> comment</c>

00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:26.409 align:start position:0%
a way to do it that doesn't encounter


00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
a way to do it that doesn't encounter
this<00:22:26.740><c> larger</c><00:22:27.100><c> issue</c><00:22:27.130><c> is</c><00:22:27.460><c> that</c><00:22:27.640><c> correct</c><00:22:29.580><c> yeah</c><00:22:30.580><c> I</c>

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:30.610 align:start position:0%
this larger issue is that correct yeah I


00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
this larger issue is that correct yeah I
mean<00:22:30.850><c> my</c><00:22:31.000><c> stance</c><00:22:31.270><c> that</c><00:22:31.360><c> would</c><00:22:31.539><c> be</c><00:22:31.630><c> like</c><00:22:31.779><c> it</c><00:22:31.929><c> if</c>

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:32.169 align:start position:0%
mean my stance that would be like it if


00:22:32.169 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
mean my stance that would be like it if
you<00:22:32.860><c> avoid</c><00:22:33.490><c> this</c><00:22:33.700><c> issue</c><00:22:33.880><c> you'll</c><00:22:34.270><c> find</c><00:22:34.539><c> a</c>

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:34.630 align:start position:0%
you avoid this issue you'll find a


00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.090 align:start position:0%
you avoid this issue you'll find a
difference<00:22:34.960><c> like</c><00:22:35.260><c> we'll</c><00:22:35.470><c> find</c><00:22:35.740><c> the</c><00:22:35.919><c> other</c>

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:36.100 align:start position:0%
difference like we'll find the other


00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.029 align:start position:0%
difference like we'll find the other
issues<00:22:36.490><c> that</c><00:22:36.520><c> were</c><00:22:36.789><c> problems</c><00:22:37.149><c> with</c><00:22:37.210><c> cap</c><00:22:37.480><c> 31</c>

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
issues that were problems with cap 31


00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:40.529 align:start position:0%
issues that were problems with cap 31
which<00:22:39.039><c> we</c><00:22:39.220><c> rejected</c><00:22:39.700><c> in</c><00:22:39.820><c> favor</c><00:22:40.029><c> of</c><00:22:40.149><c> this</c><00:22:40.330><c> so</c>

00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:40.539 align:start position:0%
which we rejected in favor of this so


00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
which we rejected in favor of this so
it's<00:22:40.690><c> like</c><00:22:41.070><c> you</c><00:22:42.070><c> can't</c><00:22:42.490><c> avoid</c><00:22:42.640><c> both</c><00:22:42.909><c> sets</c><00:22:43.270><c> of</c>

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.390 align:start position:0%
it's like you can't avoid both sets of


00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.029 align:start position:0%
it's like you can't avoid both sets of
problems<00:22:43.630><c> you</c><00:22:44.049><c> have</c><00:22:44.200><c> to</c><00:22:44.350><c> pick</c><00:22:44.559><c> which</c><00:22:44.740><c> one</c><00:22:44.770><c> you</c>

I'm picked this one this set of problems
only<00:22:48.429><c> from</c><00:22:48.669><c> the</c><00:22:48.760><c> perspective</c><00:22:49.179><c> that</c><00:22:49.210><c> like</c>

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:49.510 align:start position:0%
only from the perspective that like


00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.610 align:start position:0%
only from the perspective that like
they're<00:22:50.110><c> problems</c><00:22:50.440><c> that</c><00:22:50.529><c> are</c>

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:50.620 align:start position:0%
they're problems that are


00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're problems that are
general-purpose<00:22:51.190><c> manifestations</c><00:22:51.940><c> not</c><00:22:52.480><c> not</c>

00:22:53.159 --> 00:22:53.169 align:start position:0%
general-purpose manifestations not not

general-purpose manifestations not not
single<00:22:53.470><c> purpose</c><00:22:53.799><c> and</c><00:22:54.279><c> I</c><00:22:55.059><c> think</c><00:22:55.090><c> that</c><00:22:55.480><c> the</c>

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:55.630 align:start position:0%
single purpose and I think that the


00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.269 align:start position:0%
single purpose and I think that the
other<00:22:55.750><c> benefits</c><00:22:56.200><c> are</c><00:22:56.320><c> better</c><00:22:56.440><c> is</c><00:22:56.620><c> on</c><00:22:56.919><c> top</c><00:22:57.250><c> of</c>

00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
other benefits are better is on top of


00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
other benefits are better is on top of
that<00:22:57.870><c> but</c><00:22:58.870><c> John</c><00:22:59.049><c> you</c><00:22:59.080><c> think</c><00:22:59.200><c> you</c><00:22:59.380><c> can</c><00:22:59.529><c> add</c><00:22:59.679><c> this</c>

00:22:59.880 --> 00:22:59.890 align:start position:0%
that but John you think you can add this


00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
that but John you think you can add this
language<00:23:00.070><c> before</c><00:23:00.370><c> final</c><00:23:00.880><c> comment</c><00:23:01.210><c> period</c>

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.130 align:start position:0%
language before final comment period
yeah<00:23:02.080><c> I</c><00:23:02.110><c> I</c><00:23:02.559><c> mean</c><00:23:02.799><c> like</c><00:23:03.659><c> we</c><00:23:04.659><c> make</c><00:23:04.840><c> modifications</c>

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:05.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean like we make modifications


00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.710 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean like we make modifications
to<00:23:05.770><c> these</c><00:23:06.159><c> during</c><00:23:06.429><c> implementation</c><00:23:06.669><c> also</c><00:23:07.360><c> and</c>

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
to these during implementation also and


00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
to these during implementation also and
then<00:23:07.809><c> we're</c><00:23:07.929><c> going</c><00:23:08.049><c> to</c><00:23:08.169><c> the</c><00:23:08.260><c> implementation</c>

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:08.470 align:start position:0%
then we're going to the implementation


00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.810 align:start position:0%

period so yeah I mean I'll add the


00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
period so yeah I mean I'll add the

final comment period for sure so you'll


00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
final comment period for sure so you'll
add<00:23:14.350><c> it</c><00:23:14.529><c> and</c><00:23:14.679><c> then</c><00:23:14.830><c> we'll</c><00:23:15.010><c> vote</c><00:23:15.960><c> okay</c><00:23:17.789><c> John</c>

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:34.270 align:start position:0%
because right now in a bank transaction


00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.390 align:start position:0%
because right now in a bank transaction
we<00:26:35.270><c> use</c><00:26:35.510><c> the</c><00:26:35.810><c> clothes</c><00:26:36.290><c> time</c><00:26:36.680><c> decided</c><00:26:37.100><c> during</c>

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
we use the clothes time decided during


00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.630 align:start position:0%
we use the clothes time decided during
consensus<00:26:38.230><c> and</c><00:26:39.230><c> that</c><00:26:39.290><c> can</c><00:26:40.010><c> create</c><00:26:40.280><c> issues</c><00:26:40.430><c> for</c>

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
consensus and that can create issues for


00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
consensus and that can create issues for
the<00:26:40.910><c> transaction</c><00:26:41.480><c> gets</c><00:26:41.720><c> accepted</c><00:26:42.260><c> but</c><00:26:42.920><c> into</c><00:26:43.670><c> a</c>

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:43.730 align:start position:0%
the transaction gets accepted but into a

the transaction gets accepted but into a

mean this seems somewhat dangerous this


00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.390 align:start position:0%
mean this seems somewhat dangerous this
means<00:28:16.110><c> like</c><00:28:16.260><c> if</c><00:28:16.440><c> there's</c><00:28:16.680><c> an</c><00:28:16.770><c> outage</c><00:28:17.010><c> it's</c>

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
means like if there's an outage it's


00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
means like if there's an outage it's
possible<00:28:17.880><c> that</c><00:28:18.000><c> we</c><00:28:18.120><c> can</c><00:28:18.240><c> apply</c><00:28:18.750><c> a</c><00:28:18.780><c> transaction</c>

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
possible that we can apply a transaction


00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.980 align:start position:0%
possible that we can apply a transaction
that's<00:28:19.560><c> like</c><00:28:19.710><c> an</c><00:28:19.830><c> hour</c><00:28:19.950><c> old</c><00:28:20.310><c> or</c><00:28:20.580><c> something</c>

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:20.990 align:start position:0%
that's like an hour old or something


00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.980 align:start position:0%
that's like an hour old or something
yeah<00:28:22.020><c> that's</c><00:28:22.760><c> yes</c><00:28:23.760><c> and</c><00:28:24.060><c> the</c><00:28:24.300><c> first</c><00:28:24.480><c> time</c><00:28:24.750><c> make</c>

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:24.990 align:start position:0%
yeah that's yes and the first time make


00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
yeah that's yes and the first time make
also<00:28:25.500><c> jump</c><00:28:25.800><c> by</c><00:28:25.950><c> an</c><00:28:26.100><c> hour</c><00:28:28.190><c> right</c><00:28:29.190><c> so</c><00:28:29.730><c> there's</c><00:28:29.910><c> no</c>

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
also jump by an hour right so there's no


00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.570 align:start position:0%
also jump by an hour right so there's no

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
like with we have to decide I mean this


00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:37.460 align:start position:0%
like with we have to decide I mean this
is<00:28:32.790><c> not</c><00:28:32.970><c> a</c><00:28:34.640><c> you</c><00:28:35.640><c> know</c><00:28:36.080><c> that's</c><00:28:37.080><c> just</c><00:28:37.290><c> the</c><00:28:37.380><c> way</c>

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:37.470 align:start position:0%
is not a you know that's just the way


00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
is not a you know that's just the way
they<00:28:37.610><c> know</c><00:28:38.610><c> you</c><00:28:38.760><c> have</c><00:28:38.820><c> to</c><00:28:38.940><c> make</c><00:28:39.090><c> a</c><00:28:39.120><c> trade-off</c>

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.330 align:start position:0%
they know you have to make a trade-off


00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
they know you have to make a trade-off
you<00:28:39.570><c> know</c><00:28:39.810><c> what</c><00:28:40.230><c> happens</c><00:28:40.500><c> you</c><00:28:40.620><c> have</c><00:28:40.710><c> an</c><00:28:41.400><c> outage</c>

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.170 align:start position:0%
you know what happens you have an outage


00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know what happens you have an outage
which<00:28:43.170><c> transactions</c><00:28:43.920><c> you</c><00:28:44.040><c> want</c><00:28:44.190><c> to</c><00:28:44.310><c> reject</c><00:28:44.640><c> I</c>

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:44.970 align:start position:0%
which transactions you want to reject I


00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:50.570 align:start position:0%
which transactions you want to reject I
guess<00:28:49.370><c> so</c>

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
guess so


00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.340 align:start position:0%
guess so
like<00:28:50.790><c> let's</c><00:28:51.000><c> say</c><00:28:51.150><c> that</c><00:28:51.360><c> like</c><00:28:51.570><c> we</c><00:28:52.140><c> have</c><00:28:52.260><c> an</c>

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:52.350 align:start position:0%
like let's say that like we have an


00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.110 align:start position:0%
like let's say that like we have an
option<00:28:52.800><c> where</c><00:28:52.980><c> I</c><00:28:53.010><c> have</c><00:28:53.190><c> a</c><00:28:53.250><c> transaction</c><00:28:53.730><c> that</c><00:28:54.060><c> I</c>

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
option where I have a transaction that I


00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.090 align:start position:0%
option where I have a transaction that I
can<00:28:54.300><c> submit</c><00:28:54.630><c> that</c><00:28:54.690><c> will</c><00:28:54.960><c> trade</c><00:28:55.260><c> X</c><00:28:55.530><c> for</c><00:28:55.890><c> Y</c><00:28:56.070><c> or</c>

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
can submit that will trade X for Y or


00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.820 align:start position:0%
can submit that will trade X for Y or
something<00:28:56.850><c> right</c><00:28:57.150><c> and</c><00:28:57.360><c> since</c><00:28:58.350><c> I</c><00:28:58.500><c> don't</c><00:28:58.560><c> know</c>

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:58.830 align:start position:0%
something right and since I don't know


00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
something right and since I don't know
the<00:28:59.100><c> value</c><00:28:59.370><c> of</c><00:28:59.400><c> x</c><00:28:59.580><c> and</c><00:28:59.760><c> y</c><00:28:59.940><c> in</c><00:29:00.390><c> an</c><00:29:00.840><c> hour</c><00:29:00.990><c> you</c><00:29:01.770><c> know</c>

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:01.890 align:start position:0%
the value of x and y in an hour you know


00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
the value of x and y in an hour you know
like<00:29:02.160><c> we</c><00:29:02.340><c> agreed</c><00:29:02.430><c> on</c><00:29:02.670><c> this</c><00:29:02.940><c> now</c><00:29:03.120><c> so</c><00:29:03.420><c> now</c><00:29:03.570><c> I</c>

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
like we agreed on this now so now I


00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.490 align:start position:0%
like we agreed on this now so now I
could<00:29:03.780><c> theoretically</c><00:29:05.510><c> you</c><00:29:06.510><c> know</c><00:29:06.630><c> toss</c><00:29:07.170><c> the</c>

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
could theoretically you know toss the


00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
could theoretically you know toss the
network<00:29:07.890><c> and</c><00:29:08.190><c> get</c><00:29:08.460><c> like</c><00:29:08.670><c> a</c><00:29:08.700><c> free</c><00:29:08.970><c> option</c><00:29:09.240><c> to</c>

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.050 align:start position:0%
network and get like a free option to


00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.490 align:start position:0%
network and get like a free option to
you<00:29:10.590><c> know</c><00:29:10.710><c> basically</c><00:29:11.660><c> make</c><00:29:12.660><c> my</c><00:29:12.870><c> decision</c><00:29:13.350><c> with</c>

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know basically make my decision with


00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.260 align:start position:0%
you know basically make my decision with
an<00:29:13.620><c> extra</c><00:29:13.920><c> hours</c><00:29:14.280><c> worth</c><00:29:14.520><c> of</c><00:29:14.730><c> information</c><00:29:15.000><c> I</c>

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:17.270 align:start position:0%
an extra hours worth of information I


00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:22.460 align:start position:0%
an extra hours worth of information I
mean<00:29:18.270><c> obviously</c><00:29:19.880><c> the</c><00:29:20.880><c> alternative</c><00:29:21.480><c> is</c><00:29:21.690><c> and</c>

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
mean obviously the alternative is and


00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.180 align:start position:0%
mean obviously the alternative is and
that's<00:29:22.890><c> a</c><00:29:23.040><c> lot</c><00:29:23.220><c> harder</c><00:29:23.460><c> is</c><00:29:23.880><c> to</c><00:29:24.980><c> remove</c><00:29:25.980><c> those</c>

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.190 align:start position:0%
that's a lot harder is to remove those


00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.100 align:start position:0%
that's a lot harder is to remove those

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:44.930 align:start position:0%
you do with them because it is basically


00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.230 align:start position:0%
you do with them because it is basically
the<00:30:45.380><c> the</c><00:30:45.650><c> I</c><00:30:45.680><c> guess</c><00:30:45.980><c> the</c><00:30:46.130><c> reason</c><00:30:46.520><c> we</c><00:30:46.880><c> have</c><00:30:47.090><c> this</c>

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
the the I guess the reason we have this


00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.710 align:start position:0%
the the I guess the reason we have this

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
problem is the close time and


00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%

we're gonna take the sequence number and

it's worth looking at least a little

00:39:04.039 --> 00:39:04.049 align:start position:0%

I<00:39:10.769><c> think</c><00:39:10.819><c> because</c><00:39:11.819><c> David</c><00:39:12.179><c> had</c><00:39:12.209><c> this</c><00:39:12.479><c> other</c>

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:13.609 align:start position:0%
I think because David had this other


00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:17.059 align:start position:0%
I think because David had this other

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:28.429 align:start position:0%
problem on time bonds that's basically
is<00:39:26.549><c> what</c><00:39:26.880><c> ended</c><00:39:27.269><c> up</c><00:39:27.329><c> being</c><00:39:27.390><c> replaced</c><00:39:27.929><c> by</c><00:39:28.049><c> cap</c>

00:39:28.429 --> 00:39:28.439 align:start position:0%

23<00:39:29.009><c> I</c><00:39:29.929><c> think</c><00:39:31.729><c> but</c><00:39:32.729><c> in</c><00:39:32.969><c> that</c><00:39:33.150><c> proposal</c><00:39:33.809><c> he</c><00:39:33.989><c> had</c>

you have this type of attacks I think


00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:23.539 align:start position:0%
you have this type of attacks I think
that's<00:40:22.109><c> made</c><00:40:22.259><c> it</c><00:40:22.380><c> just</c><00:40:22.589><c> you</c><00:40:22.949><c> know</c><00:40:23.039><c> one</c><00:40:23.309><c> of</c><00:40:23.429><c> the</c>

00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:23.549 align:start position:0%
that's made it just you know one of the

that's made it just you know one of the

other things that we need to think about


00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
other things that we need to think about
here<00:40:25.939><c> yeah</c>

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.370 align:start position:0%

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
 so yeah it basically what I'm saying


00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.650 align:start position:0%
 so yeah it basically what I'm saying
is<00:40:34.470><c> before</c><00:40:34.800><c> someone</c><00:40:35.340><c> invests</c><00:40:35.760><c> the</c><00:40:35.940><c> time</c><00:40:36.300><c> to</c>

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
is before someone invests the time to


00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.630 align:start position:0%
is before someone invests the time to

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
like write a whole cap for this let's

like write a whole cap for this let's
just<00:40:38.850><c> like</c><00:40:38.970><c> get</c><00:40:39.180><c> some</c><00:40:39.450><c> requirements</c><00:40:40.140><c> down</c><00:40:40.290><c> and</c>

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
great so the next item is issue 624


00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.270 align:start position:0%
great so the next item is issue 624
which<00:41:11.310><c> is</c><00:41:12.080><c> improved</c><00:41:13.080><c> the</c><00:41:13.260><c> cap</c><00:41:13.440><c> process</c><00:41:13.920><c> so</c><00:41:14.130><c> it</c>

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
which is improved the cap process so it


00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.660 align:start position:0%
which is improved the cap process so it

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.010 align:start position:0%
clarifies the role of working groups
also<00:41:17.670><c> it</c><00:41:18.000><c> tends</c><00:41:18.180><c> to</c><00:41:18.240><c> take</c><00:41:18.420><c> into</c><00:41:18.720><c> account</c><00:41:18.900><c> more</c>

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
also it tends to take into account more

group<00:43:01.580><c> so</c><00:43:02.580><c> I</c><00:43:02.670><c> think</c><00:43:02.880><c> like</c><00:43:03.570><c> if</c><00:43:03.810><c> we</c><00:43:03.990><c> end</c><00:43:04.110><c> up</c><00:43:04.260><c> with</c>

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
group so I think like if we end up with


00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.860 align:start position:0%
group so I think like if we end up with
like<00:43:05.430><c> more</c><00:43:05.730><c> something</c><00:43:06.060><c> more</c><00:43:06.360><c> like</c><00:43:06.540><c> what</c><00:43:06.720><c> I'm</c>

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:06.870 align:start position:0%
like more something more like what I'm


00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
like more something more like what I'm

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
buddy


00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.510 align:start position:0%
buddy
it<00:43:16.110><c> just</c><00:43:16.320><c> sounds</c><00:43:16.650><c> I</c><00:43:16.890><c> just</c><00:43:17.160><c> don't</c><00:43:17.310><c> like</c><00:43:17.370><c> the</c>

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
it just sounds I just don't like the


00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
it just sounds I just don't like the
sound<00:43:17.700><c> of</c><00:43:17.730><c> it</c><00:43:17.850><c> okay</c><00:43:18.330><c> but</c><00:43:18.720><c> also</c><00:43:18.870><c> I</c><00:43:19.050><c> think</c><00:43:19.260><c> if</c>

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
sound of it okay but also I think if


00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.870 align:start position:0%
sound of it okay but also I think if
it's<00:43:19.890><c> something</c><00:43:20.100><c> that</c><00:43:20.130><c> we're</c><00:43:20.310><c> not</c><00:43:20.340><c> using</c><00:43:20.610><c> and</c>

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's something that we're not using and


00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.950 align:start position:0%
it's something that we're not using and
it<00:43:20.940><c> was</c><00:43:20.970><c> the</c><00:43:21.120><c> same</c><00:43:21.330><c> thing</c><00:43:21.360><c> that</c><00:43:21.510><c> John</c><00:43:21.750><c> brought</c>

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
it was the same thing that John brought


00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.660 align:start position:0%
it was the same thing that John brought
up<00:43:22.080><c> on</c><00:43:22.200><c> this</c><00:43:22.320><c> with</c><00:43:22.500><c> it</c><00:43:22.650><c> with</c><00:43:22.830><c> the</c><00:43:22.920><c> test</c><00:43:23.220><c> section</c>

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:23.670 align:start position:0%
up on this with it with the test section


00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.780 align:start position:0%
up on this with it with the test section
right<00:43:24.120><c> like</c><00:43:24.360><c> I</c><00:43:24.860><c> guess</c><00:43:25.860><c> that</c><00:43:26.220><c> we</c><00:43:26.310><c> need</c><00:43:26.430><c> to</c><00:43:26.580><c> just</c>

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:26.790 align:start position:0%
right like I guess that we need to just


00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.660 align:start position:0%
right like I guess that we need to just
look<00:43:27.540><c> at</c><00:43:27.660><c> the</c><00:43:27.960><c> actual</c><00:43:28.140><c> I</c><00:43:28.680><c> guess</c><00:43:29.280><c> it</c><00:43:29.430><c> leaves</c><00:43:29.580><c> in</c>

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:29.670 align:start position:0%
look at the actual I guess it leaves in


00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
look at the actual I guess it leaves in
the<00:43:29.730><c> cap</c><00:43:29.910><c> reading</c><00:43:30.360><c> that</c><00:43:30.510><c> defines</c><00:43:30.960><c> the</c><00:43:31.320><c> the</c><00:43:31.620><c> cap</c>

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:31.890 align:start position:0%
the cap reading that defines the the cap


00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
the cap reading that defines the the cap
process<00:43:32.370><c> and</c><00:43:32.520><c> make</c><00:43:32.640><c> sure</c><00:43:32.790><c> that</c><00:43:32.910><c> it</c><00:43:33.000><c> actually</c>

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:33.890 align:start position:0%
process and make sure that it actually


00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
process and make sure that it actually
adheres<00:43:34.890><c> to</c><00:43:35.520><c> a</c><00:43:35.850><c> process</c><00:43:36.300><c> that</c><00:43:36.450><c> we</c><00:43:36.630><c> feel</c><00:43:36.840><c> good</c>

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.050 align:start position:0%
adheres to a process that we feel good


00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
adheres to a process that we feel good
about<00:43:37.110><c> and</c><00:43:37.560><c> that</c><00:43:37.710><c> reflects</c><00:43:38.430><c> what</c><00:43:38.580><c> we've</c>

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:38.730 align:start position:0%
about and that reflects what we've


00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.460 align:start position:0%
about and that reflects what we've
learned<00:43:38.940><c> but</c><00:43:39.480><c> then</c><00:43:39.600><c> I</c><00:43:39.630><c> think</c><00:43:39.900><c> we</c><00:43:40.020><c> also</c><00:43:40.170><c> need</c><00:43:40.260><c> to</c>

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:40.470 align:start position:0%
learned but then I think we also need to


00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.290 align:start position:0%
learned but then I think we also need to
be<00:43:40.560><c> relying</c><00:43:40.890><c> more</c><00:43:41.310><c> strongly</c><00:43:41.580><c> on</c><00:43:41.850><c> working</c>

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
be relying more strongly on working


00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.190 align:start position:0%
be relying more strongly on working
groups<00:43:42.480><c> right</c><00:43:43.140><c> yeah</c><00:43:43.800><c> and</c><00:43:44.480><c> maybe</c><00:43:45.480><c> like</c><00:43:45.810><c> III</c>

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
groups right yeah and maybe like III


00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
groups right yeah and maybe like III
maybe<00:43:46.860><c> this</c><00:43:47.010><c> time</c><00:43:47.520><c> we</c><00:43:47.700><c> can</c><00:43:47.730><c> I</c><00:43:48.150><c> saw</c><00:43:48.510><c> that</c><00:43:48.660><c> Eric</c>

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
maybe this time we can I saw that Eric


00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
maybe this time we can I saw that Eric
had<00:43:49.140><c> a</c><00:43:49.380><c> question</c><00:43:50.010><c> like</c><00:43:50.880><c> what</c><00:43:50.910><c> does</c><00:43:51.180><c> it</c><00:43:51.300><c> mean</c><00:43:51.480><c> to</c>

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:51.810 align:start position:0%
had a question like what does it mean to


00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:54.740 align:start position:0%
had a question like what does it mean to
have<00:43:52.200><c> the</c><00:43:52.550><c> rest</c><00:43:53.550><c> of</c><00:43:53.730><c> the</c><00:43:53.820><c> stack</c><00:43:54.150><c> you</c><00:43:54.360><c> know</c><00:43:54.480><c> like</c>

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:54.750 align:start position:0%
have the rest of the stack you know like


00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.500 align:start position:0%
have the rest of the stack you know like
light<00:43:55.230><c> up</c><00:43:55.440><c> and</c><00:43:55.710><c> all</c><00:43:55.980><c> that</c><00:43:56.010><c> like</c><00:43:56.340><c> to</c><00:43:57.210><c> me</c><00:43:57.360><c> the</c>

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:57.510 align:start position:0%
light up and all that like to me the


00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:02.410 align:start position:0%
light up and all that like to me the
intention<00:43:58.140><c> is</c><00:43:58.320><c> to</c><00:43:58.380><c> have</c><00:43:58.860><c> the</c><00:43:59.550><c> working</c><00:43:59.910><c> group</c>

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:02.420 align:start position:0%



00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.380 align:start position:0%

think<00:44:03.420><c> about</c><00:44:03.780><c> the</c><00:44:04.310><c> implications</c><00:44:05.310><c> of</c><00:44:05.670><c> that</c>

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:06.390 align:start position:0%
think about the implications of that


00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.950 align:start position:0%
think about the implications of that
change<00:44:07.080><c> in</c><00:44:07.530><c> a</c><00:44:07.650><c> more</c><00:44:07.830><c> holistic</c><00:44:08.070><c> manner</c>

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
change in a more holistic manner


00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
change in a more holistic manner
basically<00:44:09.960><c> if</c><00:44:10.080><c> we</c><00:44:10.110><c> need</c><00:44:10.320><c> like</c><00:44:10.620><c> very</c><00:44:11.040><c> often</c>

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:11.370 align:start position:0%
basically if we need like very often


00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.370 align:start position:0%
basically if we need like very often
some<00:44:11.760><c> of</c><00:44:11.790><c> the</c><00:44:11.970><c> changes</c><00:44:12.330><c> at</c><00:44:12.510><c> all</c><00:44:12.540><c> we</c><00:44:12.900><c> need</c><00:44:13.020><c> a</c><00:44:13.050><c> set</c>

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
some of the changes at all we need a set


00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
some of the changes at all we need a set

basically no the sap is not should be

cap you know by the working group if

that's the only way that that thing can

to find bugs in the cap another thing on

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:33.470 align:start position:0%
performance because I think Eric with


00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.020 align:start position:0%
performance because I think Eric with

do it in that protocol version if we do

with a specific change that means we're

with a specific change that means we're

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
not thinking about it right so I think


00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.620 align:start position:0%
not thinking about it right so I think
that<00:46:49.979><c> the</c><00:46:50.099><c> additional</c><00:46:50.549><c> lift</c><00:46:50.789><c> here</c><00:46:51.119><c> which</c><00:46:51.450><c> is</c>

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:51.630 align:start position:0%
that the additional lift here which is


00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
that the additional lift here which is
reasonable<00:46:52.109><c> is</c><00:46:52.319><c> to</c><00:46:52.559><c> basically</c><00:46:53.279><c> improve</c><00:46:53.519><c> the</c>

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:53.849 align:start position:0%
reasonable is to basically improve the


00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:55.069 align:start position:0%
reasonable is to basically improve the
process<00:46:54.239><c> of</c><00:46:54.299><c> putting</c><00:46:54.450><c> together</c><00:46:54.630><c> working</c>

00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
process of putting together working


00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:56.690 align:start position:0%
process of putting together working
grade<00:46:55.229><c> so</c><00:46:55.349><c> it's</c><00:46:55.499><c> like</c><00:46:55.619><c> improve</c><00:46:56.489><c> what</c><00:46:56.670><c> a</c>

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
grade so it's like improve what a


00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.299 align:start position:0%
grade so it's like improve what a
working<00:46:56.999><c> group</c><00:46:57.119><c> does</c><00:46:57.529><c> define</c><00:46:58.529><c> it</c><00:46:58.710><c> better</c><00:46:58.859><c> add</c>

00:46:59.299 --> 00:46:59.309 align:start position:0%
working group does define it better add


00:46:59.309 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
working group does define it better add
it<00:46:59.519><c> to</c><00:46:59.609><c> the</c><00:46:59.670><c> cap</c><00:46:59.849><c> process</c><00:47:00.329><c> and</c><00:47:00.569><c> then</c><00:47:01.259><c> also</c><00:47:01.559><c> get</c>

00:47:02.359 --> 00:47:02.369 align:start position:0%
it to the cap process and then also get


00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
it to the cap process and then also get
better<00:47:02.609><c> at</c><00:47:02.729><c> putting</c><00:47:02.940><c> working</c><00:47:03.269><c> groups</c><00:47:03.450><c> data</c>

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:03.690 align:start position:0%
better at putting working groups data


00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:06.109 align:start position:0%

which<00:47:03.960><c> is</c><00:47:04.249><c> seems</c><00:47:05.249><c> reasonable</c><00:47:05.700><c> to</c><00:47:05.729><c> me</c>

horizon is gonna be broken by this and


00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.730 align:start position:0%
horizon is gonna be broken by this and
we<00:51:34.599><c> know</c><00:51:34.690><c> lots</c><00:51:34.869><c> of</c><00:51:34.960><c> people</c><00:51:35.200><c> depend</c><00:51:35.440><c> on</c><00:51:35.530><c> horizon</c>

like that you know you don't need a set

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:47.380 align:start position:0%
you're adding a new feature like it


00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.990 align:start position:0%
you're adding a new feature like it
generally<00:51:47.890><c> is</c><00:51:48.010><c> gonna</c><00:51:48.160><c> make</c><00:51:48.310><c> sense</c><00:51:48.580><c> to</c><00:51:48.790><c> have</c><00:51:48.940><c> a</c>

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
generally is gonna make sense to have a


00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.810 align:start position:0%
generally is gonna make sense to have a
step<00:51:49.420><c> involved</c><00:51:50.020><c> well</c><00:51:50.920><c> maybe</c><00:51:51.430><c> it's</c><00:51:51.580><c> a</c><00:51:51.670><c> question</c>

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:51.820 align:start position:0%
step involved well maybe it's a question


00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
step involved well maybe it's a question
that<00:51:52.270><c> you</c><00:51:52.480><c> have</c><00:51:52.599><c> to</c><00:51:52.630><c> answer</c><00:51:52.990><c> does</c><00:51:53.260><c> this</c>

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:53.470 align:start position:0%
that you have to answer does this


00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:59.550 align:start position:0%
that you have to answer does this
require<00:51:53.800><c> a</c><00:51:55.080><c> sensor</c><00:51:56.080><c> is</c><00:51:56.170><c> known</c><00:51:58.230><c> link</c><00:51:59.230><c> like</c><00:51:59.440><c> so</c>

00:51:59.550 --> 00:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
require a sensor is known link like so


00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.990 align:start position:0%
require a sensor is known link like so
maybe<00:51:59.740><c> one</c><00:51:59.890><c> of</c><00:51:59.980><c> the</c><00:52:00.040><c> header</c><00:52:00.220><c> fields</c><00:52:00.640><c> should</c><00:52:00.849><c> be</c>

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the header fields should be


00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.089 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the header fields should be
like<00:52:01.180><c> associated</c><00:52:01.900><c> steps</c><00:52:02.230><c> maybe</c><00:52:02.800><c> there's</c>

00:52:03.089 --> 00:52:03.099 align:start position:0%
like associated steps maybe there's


00:52:03.099 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
like associated steps maybe there's
multiple<00:52:03.550><c> ones</c><00:52:03.790><c> right</c><00:52:04.270><c> there's</c><00:52:04.510><c> new</c><00:52:04.839><c> feature</c>

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:05.050 align:start position:0%
multiple ones right there's new feature


00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
multiple ones right there's new feature
that<00:52:05.170><c> can</c><00:52:05.410><c> be</c><00:52:05.500><c> used</c><00:52:05.619><c> in</c><00:52:05.740><c> two</c><00:52:05.859><c> different</c><00:52:06.010><c> ways</c>

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:06.450 align:start position:0%
that can be used in two different ways


00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
that can be used in two different ways
so<00:52:07.619><c> so</c><00:52:08.619><c> it's</c><00:52:08.770><c> a</c><00:52:08.859><c> kind</c><00:52:09.040><c> of</c><00:52:09.099><c> metadata</c><00:52:09.490><c> thing</c><00:52:09.820><c> that</c>

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:09.970 align:start position:0%
so so it's a kind of metadata thing that


00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.510 align:start position:0%
so so it's a kind of metadata thing that
needs<00:52:10.119><c> to</c><00:52:10.180><c> be</c><00:52:10.240><c> out</c><00:52:10.390><c> it</c><00:52:10.859><c> well</c><00:52:11.859><c> while</c><00:52:12.280><c> we're</c><00:52:12.430><c> on</c>

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be out it well while we're on


00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be out it well while we're on
the<00:52:12.640><c> metadata</c><00:52:13.000><c> this</c><00:52:13.359><c> is</c><00:52:13.540><c> this</c><00:52:13.750><c> is</c><00:52:13.869><c> kind</c><00:52:14.080><c> of</c>

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:14.170 align:start position:0%
the metadata this is this is kind of


00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
the metadata this is this is kind of

horizon changes to the SDKs because I


00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.250 align:start position:0%
horizon changes to the SDKs because I
think<00:54:03.609><c> that's</c><00:54:04.059><c> been</c><00:54:04.240><c> the</c><00:54:04.329><c> issue</c><00:54:04.450><c> so</c><00:54:04.779><c> far</c><00:54:04.809><c> as</c><00:54:05.140><c> we</c>

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:05.260 align:start position:0%
think that's been the issue so far as we


00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
think that's been the issue so far as we
have<00:54:05.349><c> a</c><00:54:05.380><c> disconnection</c><00:54:05.890><c> between</c><00:54:06.210><c> the</c><00:54:07.210><c> cap</c><00:54:07.420><c> and</c>

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:07.750 align:start position:0%
have a disconnection between the cap and


00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
have a disconnection between the cap and

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:09.789 align:start position:0%
then the implications it has downstream

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
in this nasty case so as long as we


00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.769 align:start position:0%
in this nasty case so as long as we

it
yeah<00:54:32.690><c> I</c><00:54:33.710><c> support</c><00:54:34.710><c> this</c><00:54:34.859><c> I</c><00:54:35.070><c> just</c><00:54:35.250><c> want</c><00:54:35.400><c> to</c><00:54:35.490><c> make</c>

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I support this I just want to make


00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.730 align:start position:0%
yeah I support this I just want to make
it<00:54:36.000><c> clear</c><00:54:36.270><c> that</c><00:54:36.300><c> like</c><00:54:36.540><c> we</c><00:54:36.690><c> may</c><00:54:36.869><c> not</c><00:54:37.050><c> find</c><00:54:37.380><c> all</c>

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
it clear that like we may not find all


00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.490 align:start position:0%
it clear that like we may not find all
this<00:54:37.950><c> stuff</c><00:54:38.010><c> at</c><00:54:38.730><c> the</c><00:54:39.119><c> right</c><00:54:39.330><c> time</c><00:54:39.630><c> right</c><00:54:39.900><c> it's</c>

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
this stuff at the right time right it's


00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
this stuff at the right time right it's
good<00:54:40.680><c> to</c><00:54:40.800><c> think</c><00:54:40.830><c> about</c><00:54:41.099><c> it</c><00:54:41.369><c> at</c><00:54:41.460><c> some</c><00:54:41.670><c> level</c><00:54:42.030><c> but</c>

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.210 align:start position:0%
good to think about it at some level but


00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
good to think about it at some level but
like<00:54:42.690><c> the</c><00:54:42.900><c> the</c><00:54:43.230><c> earthy</c><00:54:43.619><c> change</c><00:54:43.920><c> was</c><00:54:44.190><c> very</c>

00:54:44.359 --> 00:54:44.369 align:start position:0%
like the the earthy change was very


00:54:44.369 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
like the the earthy change was very
subtle<00:54:44.820><c> it's</c><00:54:45.359><c> in</c><00:54:45.570><c> its</c><00:54:46.200><c> one</c><00:54:46.349><c> line</c><00:54:46.560><c> in</c><00:54:46.740><c> a</c><00:54:46.830><c> piece</c>

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.010 align:start position:0%
subtle it's in its one line in a piece


00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
subtle it's in its one line in a piece
of<00:54:47.130><c> XDR</c><00:54:47.580><c> that</c><00:54:47.790><c> you</c><00:54:47.880><c> have</c><00:54:48.030><c> to</c><00:54:48.119><c> notice</c><00:54:48.300><c> and</c><00:54:48.599><c> then</c>

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:48.690 align:start position:0%
of XDR that you have to notice and then


00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
of XDR that you have to notice and then

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:50.130 align:start position:0%
realize that actually that's implemented


00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:52.339 align:start position:0%

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
all these consequences we are not gonna

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:57.690 align:start position:0%
get all the things so I wouldn't want to


00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.650 align:start position:0%

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
like gate gate the cap and the only way


00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.540 align:start position:0%
like gate gate the cap and the only way
we<00:55:00.810><c> get</c><00:55:00.930><c> those</c><00:55:01.109><c> is</c><00:55:01.320><c> if</c><00:55:01.440><c> we</c><00:55:01.560><c> like</c><00:55:01.740><c> release</c><00:55:02.190><c> some</c>

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:02.550 align:start position:0%
we get those is if we like release some

maybe I'm wrong but I think it was hard
to<00:56:09.000><c> know</c><00:56:09.089><c> and</c><00:56:09.450><c> so</c><00:56:09.570><c> you</c><00:56:09.599><c> started</c><00:56:09.990><c> doing</c><00:56:10.109><c> it</c><00:56:10.320><c> like</c>

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:10.470 align:start position:0%
to know and so you started doing it like


00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
to know and so you started doing it like
oh<00:56:10.589><c> man</c><00:56:11.070><c> that</c><00:56:11.369><c> copying</c><00:56:12.150><c> and</c><00:56:12.330><c> pasting</c><00:56:12.540><c> like</c>

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:13.050 align:start position:0%
oh man that copying and pasting like


00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:14.329 align:start position:0%
oh man that copying and pasting like
basically<00:56:13.320><c> creating</c><00:56:13.770><c> these</c><00:56:13.830><c> two</c><00:56:14.040><c> new</c><00:56:14.160><c> columns</c>

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
basically creating these two new columns


00:56:14.339 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
basically creating these two new columns
is<00:56:14.580><c> gonna</c><00:56:14.760><c> take</c><00:56:14.970><c> forever</c><00:56:15.750><c> in</c><00:56:16.230><c> like</c><00:56:16.550><c> okay</c><00:56:17.550><c> yeah</c>

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:17.930 align:start position:0%
is gonna take forever in like okay yeah


00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.500 align:start position:0%
is gonna take forever in like okay yeah
about<00:56:18.930><c> that</c><00:56:19.260><c> move</c><00:56:19.589><c> yeah</c><00:56:20.280><c> let</c><00:56:20.820><c> alone</c><00:56:21.180><c> I</c><00:56:21.359><c> guess</c>

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:21.510 align:start position:0%
about that move yeah let alone I guess


00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.150 align:start position:0%
about that move yeah let alone I guess
but<00:56:21.660><c> like</c><00:56:21.810><c> in</c><00:56:21.960><c> general</c><00:56:22.140><c> right</c><00:56:22.530><c> it's</c><00:56:22.710><c> more</c><00:56:22.920><c> like</c>

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
but like in general right it's more like


00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.130 align:start position:0%
but like in general right it's more like
we<00:56:23.580><c> should</c><00:56:23.820><c> be</c><00:56:23.849><c> like</c><00:56:24.300><c> maybe</c><00:56:24.480><c> we</c><00:56:24.660><c> shouldn't</c><00:56:24.960><c> we</c>

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
we should be like maybe we shouldn't we


00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:30.589 align:start position:0%
we should be like maybe we shouldn't we

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:39.710 align:start position:0%
evolve if you think about you know like

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
done exactly like the implication but we

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:37.170 align:start position:0%
the impact is our high level I just


00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
the impact is our high level I just
don't<00:57:37.590><c> know</c><00:57:37.680><c> how</c><00:57:37.860><c> detailed</c><00:57:38.100><c> that</c><00:57:38.430><c> can</c><00:57:38.640><c> get</c><00:57:38.820><c> but</c>

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:38.970 align:start position:0%
don't know how detailed that can get but


00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how detailed that can get but
we<00:57:39.120><c> you</c><00:57:39.300><c> know</c><00:57:39.330><c> we'll</c><00:57:39.570><c> try</c><00:57:39.690><c> try</c><00:57:40.530><c> our</c><00:57:40.650><c> best</c><00:57:40.770><c> and</c>

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.010 align:start position:0%
we you know we'll try try our best and


00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:46.090 align:start position:0%
we you know we'll try try our best and
so<00:57:41.100><c> happens</c><00:57:41.690><c> now</c><00:57:42.690><c> the</c><00:57:42.750><c> other</c><00:57:43.130><c> is</c><00:57:44.130><c> it</c><00:57:44.760><c> says</c>

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.100 align:start position:0%
so happens now the other is it says


00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.220 align:start position:0%
so happens now the other is it says

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative group of stakeholders
which<00:57:49.230><c> is</c><00:57:49.410><c> I</c><00:57:49.590><c> guess</c><00:57:49.710><c> intentionally</c><00:57:50.550><c> vague</c><00:57:50.760><c> and</c>

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.090 align:start position:0%
which is I guess intentionally vague and


00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.110 align:start position:0%
which is I guess intentionally vague and
so<00:57:52.050><c> we</c><00:57:52.380><c> have</c><00:57:52.530><c> to</c><00:57:52.620><c> be</c><00:57:52.770><c> careful</c><00:57:53.160><c> that</c><00:57:53.280><c> we</c><00:57:53.430><c> don't</c>

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
so we have to be careful that we don't


00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.530 align:start position:0%
so we have to be careful that we don't
fall<00:57:54.300><c> into</c><00:57:54.510><c> the</c><00:57:54.720><c> trap</c><00:57:54.960><c> of</c><00:57:54.990><c> thinking</c><00:57:56.300><c> about</c><00:57:57.300><c> the</c>

00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
fall into the trap of thinking about the

fall into the trap of thinking about the

00:57:59.330 --> 00:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
consequences fall for something like


00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
consequences fall for something like

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:00.930 align:start position:0%

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:02.910 align:start position:0%
else like maybe the consequences for


00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
else like maybe the consequences for
hardware<00:58:03.300><c> wallets</c><00:58:03.630><c> you</c><00:58:04.170><c> know</c><00:58:04.320><c> for</c><00:58:04.530><c> example</c>

hardware wallets you know for example


00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
hardware wallets you know for example
yeah<00:58:07.050><c> definitely</c><00:58:07.680><c> yeah</c><00:58:08.190><c> that's</c><00:58:08.430><c> that's</c><00:58:08.670><c> the</c>

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:08.970 align:start position:0%
yeah definitely yeah that's that's the


00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:10.970 align:start position:0%
yeah definitely yeah that's that's the
reason<00:58:09.150><c> is</c><00:58:09.390><c> vague</c><00:58:09.660><c> is</c><00:58:09.900><c> because</c><00:58:10.230><c> basically</c>

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
reason is vague is because basically


00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:14.180 align:start position:0%
reason is vague is because basically
there<00:58:11.190><c> is</c><00:58:11.280><c> a</c><00:58:12.380><c> when</c><00:58:13.380><c> the</c><00:58:13.500><c> working</c><00:58:13.680><c> group</c><00:58:14.040><c> is</c>

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:14.190 align:start position:0%
there is a when the working group is
