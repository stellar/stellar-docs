The chat.Yeah we're live all right.Hello hi everyone .It's a pleasure to have you with us.Today.I my name is lisa nester I am a.Senior strategist at the Stellar.Development foundation.And you are joining us for our.Third roundtable discussion second topic.That we've ever covered.And we are very happy to have you with.Us today.So I guess to get started i'd love to.Kind of frame.Again the purpose of these roundtable.Discussions hopefully we're going to.Have a lot of.Audience members and viewers joining in.And we'd love to invite you into the.Discussion as well.And then i'll jump into what the topic.For today is.So in general.At the Stellar development foundation.You know we want to make sure that we're.Facilitating. broad inclusive ecosystem driven.Discussion.Around the types of tools that the.Stuller ecosystem needs to continue to.Grow.On and have successful use cases and.Businesses utilizing Stellar.And so in that regard we've started.These enterprise roundtable discussions.To invite.Key enterprises within the Stellar.Ecosystem to sit down at a table with.Various members of the seller.Development foundation to discuss.Topics that are really timely and.Important for the growth of the.Ecosystem right now.And as i've mentioned we also live.Stream these events.And have a q a box for any viewers so.That we really can do our best to.Include all of the voices in the.Ecosystem.So if you're watching us and you.Have comments or questions as we go.Through this discussion.Please drop them in the chat box and.We'll do our best to.Respond and include those perspectives.So.For the discussion today we're going to.Be talking about custodial versus.Non-custodial applications in the.Stellar ecosystem.And so why is this an important topic.Well.The truth is that if you're building a.Product on Stellar or.Any blockchain network really one of the.First things you have to figure out.Is how to manage your user secret keys.There are two fundamentally different.Approaches that.Are seemingly practically and.Philosophically at odds.Custodial solution keeps keep keys on.Behalf of users and non-custodial.Solutions.Put keys into users hands and I think.Most of us would agree that during the.Early days of Stellar and also within.The broader crypto landscape.Non-custodial wallet designs were kind.Of by and far the default. in my opinion this is because the.Novelty of kind of being your own bank.And having direct.Access to digital assets drove forward.Applications. and wallets that were primarily not.Custodial nature.However as the Stellar ecosystem has.Grown over the last few years.We have seen more custodial design.Approaches by enterprise and our.So that's why we're opening up this.Discussion today.Because we've seen a lot of growth in.Applications on Stellar.That are getting more and more users we.Think it's a great time to check in. on how wallets are currently set up.Experiences people are having and how.They're thinking about moving forward.And then also we have two at least two.Kind of specific technical developments.Within the Stellar ecosystem. that are worth checking in on as.They're related to the specific topic at.Hand.So one is CAP 27 so CAP 27.Is allows first class multi multiplex.Accounts. this was included in protocol 13 and.It basically allows services to map a.Single seller account to multiple users.And it could make custodial solutions a.Lot easier to build.On the other hand we also have SEP 30.Which is a recovery signer.And this defines an api that enables a.User to regain access to a Stellar.Account.After losing a private key without.Providing a third party control of the.We're actually really lucky to have .The key architect for step 30 lee from.The SDF joining us today.And this solution in particular is.Something that could make non-custodial.Solutions a bit easier.So kind of checking in on where.Things are at and also thinking about.These two new technical developments.This is going to be the focus of our.Discussion today on custodial versus.Non-custodial solutions. so with that I would love to get.Started.And I would love to start by having.Our fantastic guests join us.I will call you out just because we're.On screen and not in person.So if I can invite marco to stardust.Hello thanks for having us here my.Name is marco.I am one of the co-founders at saldo.Mx.And anchor service for the mexican peso.Wonderful thanks marco all right how.About meinhard next.Yes so yeah my name is mayanhard and I'm.The ceo.And founder of satoshi pay and recently.We launched d.Transfer which is a b2b cross-border.Money transfer service.And that's kind of the main focus of.What we're doing right now.Awesome and actually for god I said that.I was going to ask a special.Surprise question so we'll come back to.You marco and this goes straight to you.Mine hard any new quarantine hobbies.That you've picked up over the last nine.Months we'll say.20 20 new hobbies.Not strictly your hobby but i.Meditate every day.So that's going to be something I picked.Up okay this time.Yeah awesome marco.Well this is exactly I mean not a hobby.Either.But i've been like learning a lot of.Cooking.Months so yeah and I enjoy it so.Happy hopefully other people are.Enjoying it too that's awesome that's.Great.Cool and then I will turn it over to you.Christian.Yes thanks for having me I'm.Christian the cto and co-founder of.D-stock.So we do tokenized securities such as.Apple and tesla and make them tradeable.On the decks.And yeah we're live since I think not.Two or three months.And have looked deep into custodial.Quite late great and any quarantine.Hobbies that you picked up.Not really hobbies actually so actually.The thing is in germany there was a.Lockdown of schools as well so I was.Like.After doing a lot of cryptographic math.In the last year I was doing a lot of.Primary school mars this year when I was.Had to teach my daughter so.That has become my hobby that's fair.Enough that's good. all right and so next i'll hand it.Over to justin.From the SDF hi I'm justin head of.Ecosystem at the Stellar development.Foundation.Excited to be here obviously well my.Team. we care a lot about what the.Ecosystem is doing and whenever there.Are improvements or changes.Part of what we try to find out is.Whether they work for the ecosystem and.Also how to get them out there so that.Everybody's using them in a way that.Makes things interoperable so.Very interested to hear people's.Feedback my quarantine hobby so far is..Asbestos remediation.That's an important hobby I hope.Everyone.Everyone checks it out any homeowner.Should make sure to develop that hobby.I live in an old house and it turns out.There was a lot of asbestos.And okay that just becomes a consuming.Thing.It can yeah absolutely okay and then.Last but not least. lee yeah hi I'm I'm .Liam khalik I'm a software engineer at.The Stellar development foundation. and I contribute to . sets like sub 30 septem and.Yeah I'm just really interested in.Custodial and non-custodial solutions.And.How we make them interoperable well.Sounds like you're in the right place.Lee. but you can you don't get away.Without letting us know if you have any.Quarantine hobbies as well. similar similar similar to christian.Definitely became a teacher as well.Okay those are skills that will pay off.Though I'm sure so.That's great I myself picked up.Skateboarding and this thing called a.Rip stick a little bit that's kind of.Like a.Cool that was you know a good way to.When maybe there's no commute it was a.Nice way to spend the afternoons after.Work.So okay great well I would love to.Dive in. I guess straight into the meat of it.Which is. i'd love to hear what each of you are.Doing.For your current custodial strategy with.Estoc and saldo.And satoshi bay and .You know maybe a little bit about why.You chose that approach.And how you're thinking about things now.Moving forward so minehart perhaps we'll.Start with you.Sure so at satoshi bay we essentially.Have three major services.One is the micro payment service that.We're known for micropayment for digital.Content.Then there's obviously the solar wallet.Open source Stellar wallet.And then recently there's d transfer and.All of all of them.Use a wallet solution that's.Self-custodial and I'm saying.Self-control here because internally we.Use that word instead of.Non-custodial because we think.Non-custodial is a bit.Misleading because there is a custodian.Which is yourself.And so we chose to be self-custodial. essentially just to have everything.Be software and all the trust is in.Software.And not in any external party not even.Us.This helps us to move further or to.Release products to the market much.Quicker.And also has removed a huge overhead.In.Potential regulation or regulatory.Regulatory requirements that we have to.Fulfill.So we can just push out the software and.Sort of have people manage their own.Private keys and.Therefore being really just a software.Provider in that sense. and that being said so for d transfer.We recently.Also released a self custodial.Resolution on monday actually to.Production.And here we really give users the.Full control over the funds.And also the reason again is a.Regulatory one.However in the future we plan to give.Users a choice maybe that.They can either have a custodial.Solution.By us or by some other external the.Custodial.Party that we partner with or even.Combine both approaches.That's super interesting I mean is that.Something that.Would be a relatively easy opt-in.Decision.To kind of automate from a back-end.Perspective or would these need to be.Two totally separate kind of.Infrastructure solutions so yeah.So the combination would be very.Separate or not very but.A pretty separate legal .Let's say connections that we have with.Our users and also technically.It would be quite different yeah so.That's also where the different caps and.Steps come into play each on their side.It's going to be quite some.Development work and also some some.Let's say legal ground work that we have.To lay first.What is motivating you to consider.Adding this second solution.Where you provide custody. mainly user experience.Because a lot of the customers we have.Are not familiar with.This sort of power that.Self has so also the power to lose your.Money essentially.And that is something we want to.Maybe.Give users the choice if they you know.Want to be in full control.Or if they trust us with a certain.Amount of.Of their money or even all of their.Money like a more like a bank-like.Service.It's also right now we didn't find a.Custody partner yet.And also we're not regulated in that way.It's we can't actually legally launch.A self.Or sorry a custodial solution at this.Point but we can launch. the self custodial and that's why we.Move forward with that.With that we can now handle bigger.Transactions as well .As much as there's digits and there's.Let's say a Stellar.Code we can we can add like even very.Large amounts if we want.That's great I really want to dive.Into some of those points more.Specifically around you know the.Usability side of things.And I'm also kind of curious to hear for.The users that you think would want a.Non-custodial solution kind of what.Is a driver or motivator there as well. but maybe let's go ahead and.Jump to marco to get a little bit more.Of our landscape about.Where we're all currently or where.You're currently sitting.Yeah thanks well. philosophically I'm personally very.Aligned with.The self-custody movement.That you know cryptocurrency has started.I don't see for example in in.Single asset blockchain such as bitcoin.The really the need.Of of thinking through like custodial.But however I i've i've seen.Stellar since the very beginning.Seeing and realizing the market.Opportunity of representing.Real-world assets on on on this public.Network and.Allow exchanges and and transfers and.That requires a lot of companies like.Ours.To that are regulated entities. capable of of holding value for.On the behalf of their users to.Participate.And the needs actually that these.Companies.Have is is they're very different.Because like they want to leverage.The this ability to hold people's funds.And and be able to to.Like improve usability as much as.Possible.And remove any any friction that can be.Created by by the self-custody.Approach which we all know very well. and I think.What what we've seen is.Under development especially you know.From.From from the ecosystem of standards.That can help expand. those custodial solutions. and and and I think that's something.That. we should think through more.And focus because the same way that.In cryptocurrency has has been like.Expanding.Thanks in big part to exchanges which.Are custodial solutions.I think that it at the end of the day it.Will be.Extremely beneficial for all if .More custodial solutions are able to.To adopt the the kind of the Stellar.Protocol in.In in a way that makes sense for them.And in that way. increase the use of of the whole.Network.And and benefit including like those .Players that are that are using .Self-custody solutions.Yeah I mean I think that this is you.Know it's .I think there's kind of a philosophical.Point of tension here.Where you know I think many of the.People within the Stellar community.Really like the financial sovereignty.That blockchain.Can provide but there's also.Typically a deep desire to create impact.To use.A platform like Stellar to.Provide more access to financial.Products and services for everyone right.And so how do we do that in really.Simple.Ways or how do we do that in ways that.Work across user types.Outside of just people who .Really understand cryptocurrency so .But marco can you help clarify. how does saldo actually work how are.You set up right now.Yeah so we we as an anchor support like.Both. like approaches so if someone wants.To. you know utilize our services through.A non-custodial solution like lobster.They can go ahead and do it but we're.Also .Maintaining a service that it's.Called.Smx that it's .Our custodial solution that we believe.It's really important for.For for the business development of of.Our company.So that basically is a very easy way.To to use a wallet that.Allows especially mexicans who are.In in the us working hard and sending.Money over.To hold a little bit of mexican pesos.In in in a digital way and and that.Replaces the need to go and cross the.Border and open a bank account which is.Almost impossible for for the majority.Of them so like we are .Really focusing on this community which.Is not tech savvy.He's not a part of the crypto community.At all and and and we've been like super.Motivated. from from what we've seen and and and.And this is a community that actually.Could not care less about like the self.Sovereign aspect of crypto but they.Just want like the task to be done.And so they we've been like developing.These with these people in mind and and.That's for our company a big focus.Right now.And and and and we also want to make it. compatible with with.Any other Stellar-based solution but.In our in in in our approach this is.A fully custodial way of doing the.Of using our anchor.Gotcha and it sounds like you already.Have some thoughts on.Where there could be more support within.The Stellar ecosystem.For being able to kind of launch these.Types of products.Yeah I think that you know they're.Already there a lot of .Interesting discussions like the like.The moxed like multiplexed accounts.That you mentioned.But probably we yeah we and I'm sure.We will talk.More about this later on but.I think that it's it's in general.Very interesting just to kind of like. see what the users are doing and and.And just like see that basically.The entire world it's it's it's gonna.Take a long time.For for for the majority of people to.Adopt .Like the self-custody tools out there.And I think that we should.Like be kind of like aware that.There's a path towards that kind of like.Decentralization and in the meantime.It's really important.To serve the people that. they want to be served in a in a.Specific way and and.For us like we are at a stage in which.Is really important to.To provide a custodial and easy to use.Solutions like like this great yeah and.I think we definitely will.Dive into some of these various.Things like multiplexed accounts more so.Great thank you so much marco and. christian I know you guys have had an.Interesting journey with these talks.So we'd love to hear about. what you guys are using how you set.Things up and how you're thinking about.The future.Yeah I already have a lot of points i.Want to touch on so .Yeah maybe I can start with there are.Actually two different ways.How you or multiple ways actually how.You can use these stock technologies so.First of all there's an api layer which.Basically everyone can use it uses.Stellar standards and people can build.Products on top of it.And for that one we actually don't have.Any opinion on what the user.How the user protects his key his or her.Keys so.We just basically verify the user and.Where he's coming from if it's not like.A terrorist something like that and then.They can use their account to trade our.Assets but .We as well that's our actually main.Product do we have a mobile app.And because countries we serve emerging.Markets.There's a mobile first approach and this.App is actually not targeting crypto.Users.So if you want to use if you're a.Stellar heavy user and you want to use.These stock assets you can use for.Example lobster wallet or something like.That but.For already non-crypto users who are new.To investing.And haven't had touch points at all.With crypto in the past.It's actually quite quite of a hard.Concept to grasp to create a private key.So like currently in our onboarding.Process which is self custodial.I'm going to start to use this word as.Well it's an xd minor. the people actually in the onboarding.Process have to create a private key and.We see actually some some kind of a.Drop-off rate right on that so it's like.People have a hard time doing that so .I understand that they're a bit scared.Maybe they don't understand it and.Things like that so that that's a.Problem actually to us and I think to to.Everyone who wants to build end user.Product that's not just. targeting early adopted adopters.And the tricky part on this one is.In the very heart of d stock is that d.Stock itself does not hold customer.Customers funds so that's that's the.Basic idea how how we can actually pull.Off the entire business.And that's true for for most of of.Crypto companies I guess.That they don't hold customers funds and.Are therefore eligible to cut off a.Lot of middlemen that are normally.Required in financial.Transactions and yeah so.Basically if we want to want to go away.From that and we're actually planning to.Do that so we need to.We want to find a solution that makes it.Easier for undo this.We have to go to some way that's not.Only self-custodial and I'm not saying. well let me phrase it differently the.First thing that we need to define or.That we have to talk about is.What actually does custodian what what.Does the custodial solution mean in this.Case and this definition isn't.Actually.As clear as I would as one would guess.So we're always talking about okay.They're self.Solving their self-custodial solutions.And custodial solutions.But the definition of custodial is quite.A bit more complex i've read it to the.Bit for example the barfin which is a.German equivalent roughly the german.Equivalent.To the icc in america defines custody as.Someone who's holding.A funds off on behalf of other people.Is able to transfer them make payments.With that and all this kind of stuff.And all holds a private key that's .Eligible to do that.And for example in step 30 that's where.You say okay we're splitting off weights.Between third parties.That need to jointly recover a key.For user.That's not really that definition so.It's not really clear that's.Actually a custodial solution that would.Require regulations.So like by the very definition of.Financial regulators it may not be but.It's actually not that clear because.It's just basically new land so nobody.Has actually challenged that.Maybe the regulators weren't even aware.That their weighted keys things like.That says.The entire entire field is it's not as.Easy.As it gets so for us it's like very.Crucial to find a solution where we.Say okay people will be able to.Recover the key but.I wouldn't call that a custodian.Custodial solution because the people.Does.Do not hold the funds of the user in.Custody they're not able to. to transfer them doing stuff with.And more importantly they are not able. yeah then they don't have to do.Insurance and things like that for it so.Yeah that's that's the basic thing i'll.Sing around it so customian solutions.Are non-custodials who.Should be it's not the only thing in the.Real midst as well just mainly for us.About key recovery that we want to try.To solve.That's great I mean I guess I'm curious.Do you mine heart or marco have.Kind of like a similar opinion or.Reaction.Extremely relevant and interesting.Because .For example I think that for.You know for a lot of regulators the.Fact that.A user of of.A regulated entity actually goes and.Does something and and loses the private.Key.Is not sufficient like for the regulator.To to just be fined.The the legal obligation you know that.That the company .Has still is is is a valid payment.Obligation.That the company needs to honor so i.Think it's it's not.Sufficient just to you know like it's.It's it's like the key management will.Not. remove or will not make go away that.Legal kind of like obligation that. some custodial companies have and and.That it's.It's it's something that it's very like.Valid.Across like all the kind of like real.World assets.Including currencies and I think .You know like.At that point like you realize that.Somehow.For example if if a user of of our.Anchor loses.Like the private key and you still see.The funds you at least.Need to show that you have a process to.Be.Able to to in a way cancel those funds.Or or or do something with with that.And then like credit back those.Tokens to the new or or like re-key.Kind of like you know like doing.Those things.It's it helps companies like ours to.Comply with with local regulations that.Are not aware.Of like what what private keys can do.And I think it's like super interesting.And makes companies like ours realize.That it's it's a very complex .Topic.That that is an interesting point you.Make.Oh you go first planet okay then.That's interesting .Okay sorry for that that's an.Interesting point to raise I mean when.You when you when you're anchoring an.Asset.You always have the option to freeze it.And okay it's still. still on chain and it's a bit harder.To keep track of it but it's still in an.Automated way you can.Can prove that this assets are frozen.When you when you for example kind of.Take away trust lines.And then you can issue the token.The assets new and that's that's it's.Somewhat of a cumbersome way.It may be easier in the future because.There are some proposed changes to.Stellar to.To reclaim assets but this is some way.For us for example to.To recover recover funds at the moment.Even if the people lose their.Their key in their self-custodial.Solution the problem.Is actually not from that so we can.Always do that the problem is merely.If the user just for example deposits a.Million in excel.And then loses this key or her key or.The same for for stablecoin so may not.Be able.Up to this process so but the the.Interesting idea of just reading the.Assets and.Reissuing them to new accounts is always.An option as well that's.So you don't have to so that you just.Give up the old account when you lose.The key.Just just on that briefly .Obviously.You need to flag the asset as being.Revocable.And yeah there's acid types where you.There's configurations where you don't.Have that so if you forgot to do that or.If you didn't plan for that then.Obviously that's not possible either.So what we've done in our micro payments.Product actually .We used a little bit of a trick there so.We are co-signing all the transactions.That are being done.From for the micropens wallets and. we also have a time locked.Transaction that we issue with each.Payment. meaning that after a certain.Period of time.The funds will return back to us if no.Other.Transactions have been made meaning that.If the user loses a key.And they flag us they tell us that they.Did so we will simply not co-sign any.Transactions.From that key anymore and then.After half a year I think it's currently.The time that we have programmed.We can then recover these funds that.Means we can issue even lumens. to the users from we kind of.Give out a bit of our liquidity.Beforehand but in that way we can.Also sort of have a account recovery for.Accounts that.Actually are lost but the funds will.Come back to us.Later after half a year sort of a.Sort of a workaround for that issue.But isn't co-signing the definition of.It not being as.Purely self-custodial.Depends on the type of weight a key has.So if you have you know like a minority.Weight and then so I don't know how the.Regulator regulator sees. different types of water signatures.Because that's also depending on the.Chain obviously. I well it's.A hybrid I would say.Yeah and I think you know just to kind.Of respond here. so one I wanted to flag. christian had mentioned.A CAP on Stellar which I wanted to name.Just if anybody's. watching yeah CAP 35 which is the.Asset clawback. CAP which is a new proposal so .If anyone's interested.In exploring that further but you.Know this is really.Interesting because it still feels like.We're dancing around.These areas of .Kind of how can you stay lean and .You know I would say kind of.Do things that allow you as an.Organization.To kind of have .A leaner regulatory framework as.Authentic. along with things that are more tied.Kind of like usability and how do we.Experiences for consumers to.That can keep their information safe.But still provide kind of like.Non-confusing.Not overburdened some experiences on the.Product.I mean do you guys see any other major.Areas that are kind of. i'll say kind of like dancing around.The surface here because I know we're.Kind of talking back and forth about.Various designs but it feels like.There's kind of like larger.Larger themes or larger questions so.Maybe I can start because I mean.We.We we've been like also thinking.About this the problem is that.If honestly it is true that it.Removes liability the fact that you can.Actually delegate the key management to.Your users.And that like fundamentally will remove.Like regular regulatory like load.The problem is that if you see what.Happens in.In fintech is that okay regulation.Is more expensive than software sure but.Is it at the top of the list.I don't think so it's like you have.Software which is cheap.And then you have regulation which is.Way more expensive and then you have.Distribution so if you see like what's.The big expenses that.The companies have it's most like.Distribution.A customer acquisition cost.Is what sometimes kills like the unit.Economics.So it's not regulation at all even if.It's like super expensive. so I think that a lot of companies.Realize that.Okay yeah there's some efficiencies to.Be made in.In that you know liability that goes.Away. but it's not the entire story so you.Still will.Need to go and find the users and that's.Like extremely expensive.And then sometimes it's even more.Expensive.If you need to make them learn.What like a 12 like.12 word password means or what. like a mechanism to.Like that it's not intuitive is to.Recover.Like the secret key for your funds so.That those things.Will add costs to that very like.Heavy heavy cost of of customer.Acquisition.Or will reduce that the universe of.People that you can target.And I think that's something that .From the business.Perspective it's it's not.Very positive.So so I have a question which is.Basically if you had.Something I mean and this sort of.Relates specifically to step 30 which i.Think is a very clever.Way to give users access to their.Account without ever having them to.Touch a.Password or know a secret key or use a.Backup recovery phase they can basically.Log into a Stellar account using just.Their phone number or their email.Address some proof of identity.Right so with a with a solution like.You know well I guess there's two.Questions one.Does a solution like that solve the user.Experience and allow you to create a.Non-custodial sort of interface or.Solution that doesn't feel that sort of.Obfuscates the crypto nature of an app.From a user.Like basically can using something like.Sub30 make it so that.A user experience for non-custodial.Wallet is just like a custodial wallet.One and two if it does.Does it solve the biggest problems or.Does it.Only solve some of the problems and.There are still a lot of problems left.Over that would still make you.Choose to use a custodial solution .I mean maybe I can I can just.Quickly say that I think it's the final.User who will judge those things.Because at the end of the day for me.It's very intuitive to use a memo id.Just to identify a final user that that.Actually hasn't been the case for the.Majority of users of exchanges.So in a way like something that feels.Very intuitive .In from the kind of the sign point of.View.And this is this is true across many.Different steps that for me makes a lot.Of sense.But once that they're implemented.Like things become trickier.And I think that's the only thing that i.That I could say probably christian can.Say much more .Yeah well I think well first of all i.Like the basic idea of.Study and it's definitely a valid one.We we do have some problems with it.By when we want to to implement it that.It's one thing that that's very common.Among when we implement step. ecosystem proposals for those who.Don't know our standards in the stutter.System that anchors or people building.On it can implement and then everyone.Can use it and it's interoperable.Between different clients and that is. that is a good thing if you're a.Client for example there is step six.And set 24 for.Deposits and withdrawals from anchors.And it's super nice so basically I am as.A developer I can go ahead and.Integrate 10 of them in a day and that's.Super nice for me as.A client developer but to be honest it's.Not something I care about as a.Developer.What I care about is optimization of the.User flow so for example deposits.Is the most crucial thing in our flow.Ever.And if I can increase conversion there.By one percent or by five percent or by.Ten percent.Then I would do that so it's not it's.I'm not fundamentally not interested in.Getting this thing done.Fast I want to get it done right and.Currently I can't do a b.Testing I can't do client-side.Validations with steps and withdrawals.For example just.Just as an example for for seventy grade.So this SEP integration.As a whole focus on clients getting the.Job done.And that's not what we want to do and.Tab 30 is kind of the same thing it has.It it automates the entire flow for our.Clients that we can just.Do it and then integrate a little .Integrate a lot with a lot of other.Clients who integrate.30 but it's it's not coming from from.The perspective of the client so for.Example i'll give you an.Example quite lately quite recently.I've lost my.Two-factor authentication and I think.Was coinbase.And it wasn't an automated process I had.To censor my passport there was a person.Talking to me and that's that's fine.It's something I would expect as a user.And it encouraged me that this those.People do their business right.Whereas on step 30 if the ease of the.Flow is like okay.My email my SMS is something I wouldn't.Fundamentally like as a user.To be connected with me that I'm just.Pushing a tech away from losing my.Entire life saving savings when.Someone captures my email.And my wife quite recently changed her.Phone number she doesn't even have.Access to a whole number anymore so it's.It's it's kind of a weak thing for us.And it focuses a lot of.It's being automated people don't have.To hassle with it it's fully integrated.It's decentralized.And that's fundamentally not anything.Our users care about the basic care you.Just want to log into the app.Have an account and never care about it.And .For us it would be totally fine if there.Would be just a person. having an hd wallet in the physical.World and it costs like.Thirty dollars or ten dollars or twenty.Dollars for key recovery because. if it's below it doesn't make sense.Anyways if it's above.Fine or we could scale it but .Having an approach that's just.Focusing on the client side wouldn't cut.It for our users so we would we would.Have to have.Have a process that's that's more.Tied to the user experience and the user.Doesn't want to want to care about that.At all I think that.Just for my side I talked a lot so maybe.I'll keep it shut now.Do you do you think that there's like i.Think I think we've mentioned .In a few points like there's this.There's this issue of.Keys being lost and then what do people. what do users go.Through to get their keys back and then.We're talking separately about.The products we're developing and all.The functionality they provide. do you think that there's room for.Custody as a product independent of the.Products.You're developing.So maybe I can take this one .Definitely.So I don't know if this is starting to.Christian but definitely for us that.Would be.Something we desperately want the.And it would have to be a custodian that.Supports different Stellar assets as.Well and there are. wallets that support lumens already.And insurance that.Support lumix but to extend that to.Other assets and maybe even traits. to some extent that would be.Definitely something we would.Want to integrate and that's actually.What we're actively looking for.I would want to make again the.Separation between custody and key.Recovery.So we don't want to have custody we.Don't want one.Want want so traditional custody.Solutions work like they don't expose a.Private key to anyone but even the users.Belonging to that.And you send transactions to some kind.Of signing service to give it back so we.We don't want that we.Won't always want to have self custody.And the user be in charge.Of the things with his with possession.Of his or her own key.What we want on top is key recovery.Solutions pretty much like sub 30 would.Offer.It conceptually with multiple recovery.Processes.As as weights where not each weight.Does not have. the option to to trade but .I understand where he was coming from it.Was it was developed with a different.Thing in mind it was what was basically.Developed for the use case.Of not only key recovery it was as.Well developed for sharing keys and all.Kind of use cases.That are required alongside when you're.Not the only one.Having access to that key and for that.Step study makes a totally perfect job i.Think.It's just like for our purposes but we.Don't want one all of those features we.Just basically want.At any any and in a very seldom selling.Case someone loses.His or her key can recover it and for.That I think it would be.Fine if there would be just like two or.Three maybe notaries or.Trust trust companies banks whatever.Who would provide the service and maybe.Maybe just a call center or something.Like that where people could.Provide their id's and initiate a.Recovery process so.For the users of ours that would it.Doesn't have to be this.Decentralized solution because most of.The users are not crypto maximalists who.Said.Everything needs to be decentralized and.All these kind of things.One thing if I could make make a.Proposal that's.A bit more technical involved would be.It's fundamental to Stellar to have.Counterparty risk right so.You have to establish trust lines to.Assets or anchors where you say okay.I trust those people so they say maybe.For this you say hello.These people are sitting in europe they.Are.They are test by the regulators there.That's a bank bank in europe that. hold the assets in custody so that's.Great I trust those guys.I encourage you to do so i.Established a trust line to to these.Stock assets.And maybe that would be true for.Custodians as well where you can say hey.I'm establishing some.Kind of custodian custodial trust lines.Where I say hey this guy.Can or girl or entity can hold a.Specific weight of my assets.So that you have it somehow baked into.The protocol level but that's just for.The far future for the very near future.It would be just.Basically fine to have two or three who.Are not who are who establish trust by.Being used by many of the enterprises.Building up on Stellar.Marco and my heart I'm interested if.That idea appeals to the two of you also. which idea that.Basically the idea of there being .Sort of trusted custodian professional.Custodians.Out there that that you could I think in.General. it's it it it fulfills a need.I i've seen always Stellar as a very.Diverse ecosystem.And I think that the problem of like.Discussing.Topics of like one solution versus the.It's like it's not giving the full.Picture of what's happening.So Stellar actually for example I the.Way I see it.Is that at least in the ecosystem we.Touch there are multiple different roles.And and and they will like some of them.Like will require something like that.And some of them.Won't so for example like we're thinking.Imagine a migrant worker that has the.Need to send.Over 200 that's not the same need of the.Market maker that facilitates like the.Exchange rates.That those other people benefit from.That actually move. millions of dollars so so so that.That makes.Completely different needs and they're.Both using Stellar.So I think in in in in one case.Like shared keys are badly needed.And in other ways what what some other.Projects.Are are doing which is like completely.Abstract in a way and.And and you know I why why would a.Company like ours. would have the liability of the.People's funds.That's because like there aren't a lot.Of funds maybe you can you can actually.Because you're solving probably you have. like you know capital requirements.Exceed those people's funds so like.Those.Things will at the end of the day.Mitigate the risks and will make you.Capable of fronting such risks.And I think that's that's what that's.What I see so in.In my mind there's a lot of like.Sophisticated players in the storage.System already. in a way that understand like how the.Mechanics work but they.Aren't yet .As many users as I would like to see i.Love to see every mexican who's.Working in.A kitchen in new york using a system.That touches Stellar.And and and when you do that it's in.My mind.A product that completely looks like.Something that this community would.Expect.And that's completely something far from.From from something like except 30 or.Something like that because they don't.Want to deal with that.It just one like deal with the same.Thing that they've been doing with other.When things fail and and and that's like.The market needed that we've seen.Yeah absolutely and I mean just one.Point that you made there that I do.Think is really important.Is that you know even when we're.Thinking about the requirements for just.An application oftentimes.There's a whole kind of like broader.Stack of.Ecosystem that's required to kind of.Make that end product.Exist and everybody who's in that value.Chain.Has kind of differing needs based on.What they're doing so. so yeah I think that's fair you know.I'd say well.We're in our last 15 minutes here and.You know I think we're already kind of.Doing this but I would love to.Drive the discussion towards.Kind of identifying gaps or.Needs or we could also put these as.Opportunities.Within the ecosystem and so maybe.I'll just.Phrase this in a slightly.Constraining manner to.To kick things off like if you marco.Meinhard and christian.Could wave a magic wand and have like.One new thing exist in the Stellar.Ecosystem to support.Your vision of key management.What would that look like like what's.The the number one thing that you think.Super valuable for you.Whoever wants whoever has a response to.I can start by by the the already.Multiplexed accounts that that we've. touched before it's in general i.Think that.That's something that in my mind is.That was missing and I think I would.Love to see.Completely adopted and the reason is.Because the way.That I feel as a user like.The way that memo ids are used.It's kind of like not intuitive.And and it's it's it feels.Like a hack you know like you know every.Everyone's familiar with.With a payment app where you can also.Like include a message that travels with.With.With a payment and so but in this.Specific.Case we're like hacking that field.That memo field to actually embed.Information.And that will make the payment to route.Differently so that became.Like the the default way of adopting.Stellar.Like for exchanges and I think that you.Know the entire.Ecosystem accepted that was the way to.Do it.But I think if there's a better way.To do it which in my.In my mind it is multiplexed accounts.We should like the sooner the better.Adopt something like that.Because you can actually free.That field which is important for.Other use cases as an example.The first implementation we did for bill.Pay actually encoded. information about the bill that .Like the reference.Of the invoice that that was intended to.Be paid and that was encrypted and sent.Over the memo so it's like to me.Those are things that. other players may may find like.Useful and interesting and will design.That way.And if we use that field as.Just an additional feel that.Together with the with the address we'll.Run the payment to to a different like.Destination I think that .That's completely in my mind.Something that shouldn't work that way.And and and and you know some evidence.Is like people make a lot of mistakes.When they're like put assets in and out.Of exchanges.And I think it feels like it's it would.Be focusing.On on people and companies using.Custodial wallets but I think it's the.Opposite I think.If it's widely adopted it's something.It would be there available for.Everybody.And they will like just add a more.Intuitive way to. just send payments to an address with.An amount.And that will like like satisfy the.Need.Of like the routing and and and all the.Information that needs to travel with.Each payment so.In my mind that's something that needs.To be .Adopted obviously discussed before.And and and for me that that wouldn't be.Like that.So you're you're putting your flag down.On the.Cap 27 planet in the Stellar ecosystem.And I don't know where I'm going with.This but you're you're squarely on the.Cap 27 multiplexed account.Team yeah I think I think so okay.Great wonderful meinhard looks like.You maybe have a thing next.Great yeah so also CAP 27 is.Really interesting for us and that's.Something unfortunately I can't.Answer maybe a leak and clarify.Does it also sort of protects the.Privacy of the recipients or is it. still easy to to.Like conclude the address that's behind.It because that is something.Also we would wish to have that we have.Not the complete balance of all of our.Clients immediately visible to maybe a.Sender.And so in a way not anonymous but.Partially anonymous transactions. at least for the recipient that would.Be quite interesting for us.And then also something that christian.Earlier said .Like a sort of a footed approach or a.Feathered federated approach for. key recovery or even for a coastal.Resolution that would be.Definitely quite interesting and then.You said.I should pick one thing but maybe.Also you can say a third thing. it would be a sort of regulated.Entities that are .Offering this custody as a service and.Not just key recovery so that's.That would solve a lot of problems.For us right now because. fundamentally we're not really .Also because of.Our consumer's perspective or our user's.Perspective .Maximalists and and like you have to own.Your key.Ultimately we want to offer a a.Transfer service that.Passes on all the advantages of .Blockchain or Stellar in this case.Mainly speed and transaction cost and.Also the transparency.And it doesn't have to be fully.Self-custodial.In our sense like we want to give the.User the choice and.The user doesn't really care much about.That they should have a online banking.Like experience.And that we need to know what's what's.Behind it and not.Also having the need to learn new.Vocabulary and.New approaches so that's like how we.Want to.Place our service that makes sense yeah.I. I concur that.You know it seems like having along.With there being some kind of technical.Aspects.To creating more capabilities.Around key management there's also.Potentially ecosystem partners that we.Could bring in that would really. support this as well so and then lee.Did you.Do you know on CAP 27 if it adds any.Anonymity or I'm not sure if that's.Something you're. too up to date on so yeah so.I can answer that it not not.Specifically so there's not like a.Feature CAP 27 that. that would make it any more.Anonymous than.Using a memo id for a transaction.However you know the service that's.Using. the services using CAP 27.You know could rotate ids for users so.They could change the id that a user is.Using over time or.Or you use some other strategies like.That that obviously has some.Disadvantages if.If somebody is treating a CAP 27 like a.Market address as.A you know an actual address for that.User. if it's changing that could be.Problematic but. I feel like this is this is similar.To .Virtual credit card numbers where you.Have like a credit card and then you.Have like.Model ones you use for different.Merchants maybe or different.People things like that.Okay great thank you lee and then. yeah well there's a short time and.There's long term so.Basically we're fundamentally focusing.On .Non-crypto users and for non-crypto.Users convenience is important so.There's a reason why why why things like.What's app.Are more popular than things like ebay's.Because they are just more convenient.And user slower in terms of the more.Convenient solution.All those but but I think that.Fundamentally the the key recovery is.Not should be.Easy on the recovery process the.Recovery process can be hard if I lose.My wallets like my physical wallets my.Credit cards in it I'm up for that that.It will be a complicated process.To get that all sorted so that that's.Fine but.Setting up my wallet and setting up my.My key that you that should be the.Easy part and for us like the easiest.Solution would be just hey on.The concretion when you create your.Account on d stock we would just add two.Or three. trusted and reputable. public keys and those people do have.Some kind of recovery process if i.Wouldn't be.Totally filled with work at d stock i.Would right now fund a company started.Start a startup.Doing exactly that because there's a.Need for that and .Like in the long term I could see that.I'm better than the protocol that's the.One thing i.Said was having trust lines to these.Custodials pretty much like you have.Trust lines to to add to assets or.Anchors.Would be a nice way maybe even you you.Could one could think about that.When you have an account and it holds.Assets from multiple different anchors.That you can say that.Those anchors could jointly recover and.Cover your key by. depending on the weights and how many.Assets you have there.As well as cloud acid clawback with cap.35 could.Put a great job into that but that's.Like it would be.Awesome to have it in the protocol.Embedded but like for our needs it.Wouldn't even be.Required for short-term solution would.Be just like victory.Hey let's get two or three trustable.Notary solicitors something like that.Out there.That we all trust and where we say hey.Let's give each.Other it doesn't cost me a lot of money.So that it could be like small.Small no trees that are just regulated.In some country and you just say.Put them up put a process behind that.That you can recover and then.I think it would be fine question just.To as a quick clarification I'm not.Sure I can exactly.Actually conceptualize what this would.Look like if it was embedded in the.Protocol and I know it's like.Very early stages high level but I mean.Could you maybe illustrate that a little.Bit more like what what you think that.Would look like.Basically that if you have so the basic.Idea.Currently is that you have at public.Keys as a signer.And what you could do is when you say.Hey we we create trust licenses and take.That for custodian.But these custodians could jointly.Recover your key even though they don't.Have.Weights in your public key could be.So basically they they would have these.Anchors would have a public private.Keeper somewhere.On the chain and this public private.Keeper would have the right to recover.Addresses they would have been added as.A signer but you don't have to.Explicitly.Had them as a signer so basically you.Create a trust line to three custodians.And then these three custodians could.Jointly recover your funds but you don't.Have to add them as a signer.So you don't have this kind of.Multi-signature thing added to your.Gotcha gotcha okay that's really useful..Great well this has been a super.Interesting and useful discussion and i.Have to say.And I'm sure justin and lee feel the.Same you know there's been a lot to take.In and digest. I really appreciate you guys sharing.Your perspective and opinion on this and.I have a feeling. we're we're kind of just kicking this. discussion off so .We did have one or two questions from.The audience which I will. get up in front of me in just.A second oh not that one there we go. so i'll just throw this out to. everyone I guess can non-custodial.Wallet apps connect.To a bank and have a user receive funds.In their native currency.So that's kind of like a non-custodial.To custodial payout flow. I believe the answer to this is yes.This is actually a type of payment flow.That we facilitate on Stellar. yeah I don't know I think.This is the intention of of all those.All the steps that have been adopted.So it's like normally an anchor that.Complies with.With the existing seps what they would.Do is basically allow non-custodial.To be able to get from an anchor.Services like.Ours like for example a bank.Informations that they can like. go from their own bank account.To to like the bank account that the.Anchor.Has and then that would in exchange. you know give the user some some.Some equivalent of of tokens so that.That flow it's it's.It's precisely how today. all of all of the active anchors are.Are doing yeah you can use lobster or.Vibrant to deposit.A number of different anchors because.They they already interoperate.Perfect great thanks guys and then. maybe justin this one's for you step.30 and CAP 27 both look cool. do any of the dev libraries or.Wallets support these currently.Yeah that's an interesting question and.Part of why I think it was good to start.To have this discussion.Cap 27 which marco advocated for.Earlier but has come up a couple of.Times.Is called multiplexed accounts it adds a.New kind of Stellar address at the.Protocol level.Basically allows a single Stellar.Account to map to multiple users.It was added to protocol 13. however there's it's kind of like we.Put in the wiring but we didn't put any.Plugs or switches right like there's no.Manifestation of this and horizon.Are in the sdks and there's no clear way. no clear like methods or standards.For actually using these mixed accounts.So they're there they're just hidden.Away and so.With those CAP 27 specifically in order.To really be able to use it we'd first.Have to build out.The sort of platform layers on top of.The protocol and then we'd have to start.Working with people to figure out how.They would actually use those so CAP 27.Is possible but not really implemented.In any existing applications.Step 30 on the other hand which is is.Not at the protocol level right it.Basically.Specifies how you can split key recovery.Across.Multiple different servers run by.Different by different.Operators right so instead of having a.Single key.Or instead of trying it it relies on.Third parties running these things.Called recovery servers right now.Vibrant which is a a wallet that.Sort of is facilitates usd savings at.The moment mostly. that relies that that uses.Two recovery servers to implement sub 30.But if other people in the ecosystem.Wanted to start implementing sub 30 in.Their wallets this specific key recovery.Method.We would need to as an ecosystem get.People to run these things recovery.Servers right.Recovery servers which are sort of the.Servers that you delegate to allow.A user to access their account if they.Lose their key.So short answer step 30 is implemented.In one wallet.And could be in more if we set up.Recovery servers.That people could use and by we I mean.The ecosystem as a whole.Having to add one point so this idea.That I mentioned about having trust.Lines for.Focus for not custodians but for key.Recovery people.The the major change that it would add.Sorry my microphone.Brother the major change that it would.Add to the current solution is that the.Current solution if you add it as a.Signer like in step 30 then you are.Always getting the other rights as well.So you can always like.Jointly transfer funds and stuff like.That having these kind of.Recovery service at the protocol level.Then it would.Really be just okay I'm adding those.People and they can.They can give me a process to recover my.Keys but they can never do payments.Transactions even if they are.Colluding or jointly hacked those kind.Of stuff and that would.Put a lot of clearance on the legal side.And it would make.This the entire setup a lot easier you.Don't have to store keys online and.Things like that so.Just clarify that yeah i.I I know that we don't have like a lot.Of time left.But I think it's it's it's interesting.To keep the conversation going.Especially because I think the.Multiplexed accounts can.Offer actually widely adopted some level.Of of obfuscation to the payments.If like people start using it because.As as.Lee said like people can use them.As as you know like like as dynamic. debit card numbers and and it's.Interesting if.The entire ecosystem adopts it then like.People would be sending money over with.Different.M accounts and that will like obvious.Scale a lot of the the information.Which is really interesting yeah well it.Sounds like.On both fronts both on kind of step 30s.Key recovery design.And muxed accounts on the cop27 side we.Have a lot of thinking to do I think.You know as we kind of said in the.Beginning this is the beginning.Of these conversations or maybe the.Middle I guess they've been going on for.A while so.We'll definitely be continuing them .So with that I would say you know i.Think it's time to to wrap up the.But I think it's likely we may want.To all meet back here. in a few months certainly after.Meridian.And continue this conversation hopefully.Making some progress in the time between.You know again christian mind hard marco.We can't thank you enough for your time.Today and for sharing your perspective. and I hope everyone has a wonderful.Halloween weekend and we'll talk again.Soon.Thanks everybody thanks everybody.
