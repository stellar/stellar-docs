My name is Lisa Nestor and I work on our.Ecosystem strategy team at the Stellar.Development Foundation and I will be.Providing moderation support during our.Discussions today so the the topic on.The table for this virtual round table.Is a direct send proposal this is a.Discussion continued from exactly two.Weeks ago on April 16th and we will be.Talking through and finalizing the the.Direct send proposal first however I'd.Love to give just a little bit of.Background on what a SEP is this is a.Stellar native term and so SEP stands.For Stellar ecosystem proposal so steps.Are publicly created open source.Documents that live in a github.Repository and they facilitate the.Creation and eventual adoption of.Technical standards within the Stellar.Ecosystem so steps are really a dynamic.Way of introducing standards and.Protocols utilized in the ecosystem.Built on top of the Stellar network and.In particular as new use cases evolve.Throughout the Stellar ecosystem new.Steps help to formalize those use cases.And make them increasingly easy to.Implement and streamline between various.Participants so specifically today we're.Going to be talking about the direct.Send SEP people are also referring this.Referring to this as a send receive set.And the purpose of this set is really to.Enable Fiat de Fiat payments that would.Be facilitated between two anchors we.Also think of this as being a set to.Support more traditional style.Cross-border payments in which a sender.Execute the transaction to receiver and.A foreign destination and really wants.That receiver to just have funds arrive.In their bank account they don't really.Want to interact with a wallet or a.Digital asset themselves so like a.Remittance or a business payment the.Transaction is executed and the receiver.Can just.The funds to date there have been some.Initial decisions made around this up.And we've linked to the the specific.Github pull requests there and so to.Move forward let me quickly introduce.Our participants today we have four.Different companies from the Stellar.Ecosystem representatives from each of.These companies that will be joining us.So we have Anthony from tempo we have.Andy from Satoshi pay blue bemy from.Kaori claudio from inclusive and Michael.From SDF so thank you all so much for.Joining us and being patient this.Morning and so finally this is what.Today's agenda will be we are going to.Work hard to talk through each of these.Line items so if you're in the stream.Feel free to kind of follow along with.Us and with that I will hand it over to.Michael from SDF to help kick things off.Thanks thanks Lisa okay so really.Quickly can't go back to the agenda yes.So last week we talked a lot about the.Happy path for this proposal I think we.Got it to a really good place we had.Some updates from from the conversation.And I think that we're pretty happy with.Where it is for the happy path where.It's simply two anchors that have you.Know good financial partnerships or our.Financial institutions themselves and.Then what we're going to talk about.Today are some additions that might be.Become a part of the set or might become.A part of an additional set then make it.Possible for a lot more parties to.Participate in this this network of Fiat.To Fiat rails so the the first thing I'm.Talking about is a well is a.Multilateral kyc then if inclusive is.Going to give us a an update about what.That is and I think the general idea.Here is it makes a much easier way for.Multiple parties to share kyc data so.Everybody doesn't have to duplicate.Efforts and people who.Might not be able to get involved.Previously can through this through this.Process and then we're going to talk.About how non-custodial applications so.Noncustodial wallets can start to.Execute these directs and transactions.So I'm going to pass it over to clutter.You apologize if I pronounced that.Incorrectly no that's fine that's fine.Thank you.You're closer than this at them from us.- so what we are doing at the Cruces and.What we are trying to achieve with.Multilateral kyc and what's let's say.Our role in the interstellar network so.Maybe you want to see if they're.Focusing on compliance checks KY c KY b.And c DD continuous due diligence.Monitoring and reporting but multiple k.Was motivated kyc as a little bit of.Background and maybe already touched in.The last discussion like each anchor for.Each payment right has to do a kyc on.The sender the said if we are talking.From bank or anchor set which is on the.Agenda and also the receiving anchor.From the regulatory point of view also.Needs to put a YC on the on the sender.Right and the center and cross on the on.The receiver so can we see multilateral.Also how we are calling its EDD connect.Basically we will enable through our.Guess product which is also late guy.Based to share this information in.Medicine formation are referring to the.KYC data without any personal.Information attached to it right so as.An example for example let's say one.Anchor from Europe wants to do payment.To an anchor from Nigeria for example.Right and the anchor from Europe already.Onboard it let's say the sender using.Our chests api's and then also Canada.From diner from Nigeria he's using our.Our cassock that's right.So when the anchor from Nigeria will do.The center kyc basically we are not.Performing another KFC check basically.We are just sharing the existing data.And let's say report and history of the.Center which was already made for the.Anchor from Europe right so basically.This is Casey Casey connect OCD connect.Right and what this brings it to the.Table it brings I think cost deductions.Right because it reduce costs it also.Makes the process more efficient right.Because but just by enabling sharing.Data also this process is almost instant.Like it doesn't involve the basic LSE.Check Nativity church doesn't involve.Too much manual interaction but of.Course it can be extended with checks.Which will involve some let's say.Offline processing in case of you know.You want to do extra due diligence on a.Certain entity or individual also this.Is multilateral AIC is not let's say.Enforcing an anchor to just you know do.Kyc in a single way basically it just.You just try to provide the framework.But each anchor can have its own.Particularities for example to extend.Kyc its own services or whatever you.Know third-party tools they are using.Right what else.So we already starting discussion I.Think our CEO is in contact with most of.The bankers which are present right now.In the call to to agree upon let's say.Requirements and use cases which all of.Us try to fulfill on the Stellar Network.So yeah and we are more than welcome.Everybody else wants to join this is.Huge initiative.Okay this exciting two reasons I think.What this gives us at least a sorry.About seasoning.Okay so this excites me for two reasons.One is what you said you mention it as.Cost savings and I think it's more than.That I think it enables you know the.Cost savings come from right now every.Anchor kind of has to be a specialist in.The KYC.Of every region which is obviously a.Huge cost and also just it's not going.To happen so this kind of says you know.This one company's going to focus on kyc.In different regions and now everybody.Else doesn't have to so that's a cost.Savings and it allows you know no no.Company is going to be able to have a.Team large enough to really work all.Over the world and the second thing that.It does and correct me if I'm wrong here.This is this kind of goes to the the.Last point in that subsection was it.Enables people who may not be able to do.Actual kyc people who are not financial.Institutions such as Satoshi bei this.Will allow them to kind of offload the.KYC process on to conclusive so when.They start a process they can get kyc.Done through a regulated institution.Like inclusive and all the other parties.In this multilateral agreement can.Accept it and that will that will.Regulatorily allow a Satoshi paid to.Start creating these transactions so we.You know there's two things blocking.Them one is the technical way does it.Fit into the second one is the.Regulatory way will other parties accept.Payments that originated from a.Noncustodial wallet so am I correct in.Saying that this this will solve those.Two problems yes you're right you're.Right we provide everything everything.You said and that's room so basically.That's that's our mission you know to.Provide easy access to to compliance.Services and also you know to banking.Integrations.And then yes also from outside that.Sounds like that's what we're aiming for.Cool to hear from the anchors does that.Make sense.From your perspective I'm just kind of.Given how you typically handle your.Responsibilities anchors to myself how.Much access we have two simple kyc.Processor and then as long as we have.You know like access to the data and so.On and so forth we could probably still.Meet the regulatory requirements saying.That yes we did do this kyc we didn't.Have access to the KYC data and when you.Do your own processing like you just.Said this is only in your own home.Country right so you still don't need to.Specialize in kic for other countries.Just yourself yes perhaps to meet the.Referee requirement in Honduras diction.Reckon each of us in country specific.And in this multilateral agreement is.That something that's allowed we're a.Receiving acre can pull the data down or.Is it obfuscated behind a token to have.The actual data to meet arranged to meet.The regulatory requirement so it can't.Be obfuscated we have to have access to.My data and insert the situation.Required to share that data with.Directly interests of for example if.There's a little vest.Or something like that they would need.To see the actual basis so bright we.Confiscated we means actually access it.In the current situation where we.Process it ourselves moving we you know.We would actually process and store my.Data so it wouldn't be a office cater to.Sighs my regulate so cardio is that.Something that's possible with your.Scheme yeah so basically just to make.Things a little bit clearer you like you.Know for example energy that you have.The data you want to do the KYC check on.It right so what you will do you will.Just call us and we will just see if.Those person were already.Kyc it right and we have a report on.Them and of course only if the.Institution like the anchors that you.Are participating in this one are.Billing to share the information about.Them right because each country might.Have its own degree place you know in a.Certain card any country maybe you are.Not allowed to share the KYC information.Even though if it's not a personal.Information right so basically each.Anchor will will own the personal.Information yes we will also have it but.You will get back the the KYC data right.So we will not get anything over skated.On it right okay any data that shared.From one anchor who's part of this.Multilateral agreement that data can.Then be pulled down by a receiving.Anchor who is also part of the.Agreements exactly it's a full data.Sharing agreement it's not like it's not.Like we're just saying what we trust.That conclusive did it so we're we're.Cool with everything we can actually.Pull whatever we need down yeah yeah.Exactly.Cool okay that that sounds it sounds.Like it.Solves the problem from from Kyra's end.I don't know if Anthony from tempos and.Does that sounds does that sound right.To you does this sound like it'll solve.Any problems from your end it could.There's EU regulation and it's going in.Place where they have to be authorized.By the EU central bank as a kyc provider.So that's something where if inclusive.Would have to get this authorization.From the EU yep yep and they and it's.Right now I don't think they've actually.Approved anybody there's a bunch of.Companies in application process but.That's the current state in EU and then.We're also doing it in Japan and in.Japan it's a little bit more lenient.They don't require this sort of.Artificial intelligence on me on the.Passport and ID or ID and we typically.Consider the EU to be kind of one of.Them the more strict jurisdictions is.That correct that's my understanding.Specifically Japan and Germany in.Switzerland strictest okay and then.France comes right after I would say.Okay cool.And then I mean the nice thing about.That is that's inclusive bread and.Butter is to get authorized by all these.Places so that everybody else doesn't.Have to so okay it sounds like to me.That scheme does solve the the.Regulatory issues with.Satoshi pay another noncustodial waltz.Being able to you know get kose data.Into the system and to be trusted from.That end Lisa can you share a link to.That agenda could I could pull up.I think the next thing that we.Talk about is the technical aspects of.It so I guess we can look at some more.These questions so the the strict we're.Asking if the strategy works for.Everybody it sounds like assuming that.Inclusive gets authorization from EU to.Provide this kind of data that this will.Actually solve a lot of these problems.We asked about if there's any.Geographies or scenarios where this may.Break down and we kind of talked about.How you know in Europe things are.Stricter but it doesn't it doesn't break.Down as long as as long as the providing.Company can can get authorized in that.Geography and then if we're looking at.Edge cases where this may not work I.Think one of the edge cases is the case.Where the receipt actually needs.Some more data so you know I'm imagining.The situation where a sending client.Comes in in a very lenient state.Provides you know some data that might.Get them access to their their.Originating countries regulations but.Once you're trying to send the summer.And EU the case it might be that they.Need more information there they're much.Stricter and so I'm curious how.Inclusive would imagine is working do we.Do we ask the receiving anchor to.Collect more data or does conclusive say.Okay well now that you're going to be.You we're gonna have to collect more.Data do we have an idea how that work.Yes so we had a we had a talk and.Discussion internally about these and to.Be honest it depends it depends on the.Customer right because each customer has.As its own needs but how we want to.Address it is like each customer will.Let's say like a compliance customer of.Ours can't define its own list of extra.Fields they want to collect right.Besides our core fields which we provide.By default for doing my C's KY based on.Individuals and entities right and this.This is how how we are ticket to bleed.And of course if for example a field to.Make sense for us also to include it by.Default in the core fields we can do.This and for example I think I can give.An example as a result of the discussion.We had with Kaori for example they they.Requested to have a custom field called.The BGN a bank coordination number which.Is specific to Nigeria and to validate.This field we have to integrate a.Specific API from from Nigeria to do.That right and then we have an internal.Internal discussion and what we decided.Is this is that look this is a core.Field for philosophy because not only.Covering is with all the entities or any.Rituals from Nigeria and need this kind.Of validation if you want to offer them.The the compliance check they need right.In that specific country and region so.That's one saying it depends on the case.On the case right because if if.Something is can be made as a core field.We will include it as a core field and.It's enabled by all the countries so if.A customer from a certain country or.Something region right if it's something.Specific let's say not to a country or.Region but to a company or entity or.Individual it can be addressed but to.Configuration so we we thought on this.And at least these are these are the two.Directions we want we want to go if it.Makes sense so when the POC is.Originally being provided when an.Originating anchor initially collects.The data are they collecting that data.With the knowledge of where it's going.To go so that they can say you know they.Can tell you hey we want to send this.Baby.You what do we need to collect or do.They just collect the data for their own.Region and send it to you and then wait.Around in the process the receiving.Anchor will then ask you for the data.Yeah okay so how I see this process is.That I think to the steps which are.Available on the on the Stellar protocol.Like each anchor will define its fields.He needs for kyc care might be right.So basically when this information is.Exchanged between anchors you know each.Anchor will not like for example maybe.As an anchor which is using secrecy as.Compliance provider maybe will interact.With an anchor which does music it.Doesn't use conclusive compliance right.And this is and 50 to correct me if I'm.Wrong this is embedded in the intercepts.Right to the fields you you can share.Between anchors so each anchor should be.Responsible to to configure these fields.Even if it's a constant field for.Example and maybe it's not on the I.Think it's set 9 which has the list of.The fields right it still can be.Requested to this exchanging of fields.Right and yeah of course if it's viable.For you also can be also added on that.List right okay so it sounds like it's.It's the responsibility of the.Originating in here to make sure that.They're giving you enough data so but.Exactly and of course some of the fields.Can be made off from some of the tea.Fields can be made required right so you.Can have this flexibility right to jump.Away the fields cool does anyone else in.The edge cases where that scheme might.Fall apart.Oh because it sounds okay but generally.What we do because well for the first.Time you might not necessarily know all.His intended jurisdictions Mike gave you.My mother everywhere intends to send she.Going forth but what we tend to do is as.We got a client we would say we would.Often which countries or which region I.Mean sending two intense eccentric now.In the future kind of thing and based on.That for example if you have payments.That are going to Europe or to include.Europe as one of their destinations then.We would try and acquire the KYC to make.The information required for Europe if.It's the u.s.we were trying to quite.Finish so we take no responsibility as.An acrobat engaged payments to get the.Correct information for correct.Destination and it's.Business-to-business payments and.There's very involving onboarding.Process we can ask the client front that.Okay are you going to meet with the US.Rep against the name of the European.Which and that means we can we have a.Better idea of what can when submission.It would meet for the destination okay.Yeah I think that's all.Make sense there's also the case where.For example for a very large transaction.We might you know the recent anger might.Need extra data and I think this is fine.The way that it would work is in the.Step right now the descending a Turk I.Checked the status the transaction.Periodically and it might find out about.There is actually more data needed so in.This case would they provide it directly.To the anchor or would they provide it.To inclusive and until the anchor we've.Updated they're kind of kyc profile with.With extra data that you needed I.Actually don't think it matters I think.Both ways would work just fine.I think from my perspective and at least.How we are placed right now I think is.The anchor responsibility because.Basically having seen these-- Cruces.With his compliance service sit under.The anchor is not exposed to the anchor.Right because all the all what you get.Exposed to the anchor is just the API.Definitions which are guided by the.Spiceps.Right so in any set right now there is.No mention of inclusive no mention of a.Compliance engine right so basically the.Anchor is responsible to integrate with.Inclusive through a set right a set.Which collects the chaos information at.Least this isn't if I'm seeing things.Right now maybe in the future.Can is everybody else still here I'm.Still here yeah I think we got a just a.Little yes delay there okay I do have.One or two comments or questions so I.Kind of on topic one of them is you know.Michael we historically had a compliance.A compliance service or compliance.Server as part of the Stellar ecosystem.Stack did you all consider using that.And why or why not yeah I think that.Step 3.I'm just gonna pull it up real quick.There there were aspects of it that we.Used for sure and there were aspects of.It that didn't quite work this is a good.Question and I think I should put some.Information about the I the answer is I.Would need to go back and kind of.Collect the answer to that I don't I.Don't have it offhand I do know that we.Referenced if you're talking about step.3 we referenced it in a lot of ways but.There were a lot of hiccups to it that.Made it more difficult its Anthony I can.I can I can add to that because we were.Using it quite a bit to compliance ever.It's a lot the this new implementation.Is a lot simpler and cleaner and this.The compliance server was a little bit.Compliment complicated to implement and.It's a little bit different from these.From the other except 24 so this will.Keep everything kind of in with one.Authentication mechanism SEP 10 and one.Kind of signing of the data gotcha that.Makes sense today great and so one other.Comment that all I'll bring in before we.Jump back into things.You know we're talking a lot about.Sharing kyc data between anchors can.Anyone speak to how we ensure that this.Data is treated securely as part of this.Process I mean you know how how does a.Consumer using an anchor know that any.Personal information they share is going.To be treated securely throughout this.Kind of anchor - anchor.Can we see exchange process.So I think there's there's there's a few.Aspects of that to look at one is.Technically how is this actually secured.And but I think the more interesting.Question is business-wise you know we.Are sharing data between entities so how.Do we ensure you know that your personal.Data doesn't get sent to some shady.Anchor that you know it steals it and.Does whatever with it so from the.Technical side I think you know.Everything's obviously encrypted I think.This about this set makes it clear that.This has to be all of our steps.Basically say you have to use HTTPS so.Everything is cryptid over the wire.Everything is authenticated using SEP 10.Was a cryptographically secure way to.Say that only authenticated people can.Access this so people who are part of.This network have all agreed on a public.Key with each other so that they can.Authenticate with each other so I think.It's safe to say that for all reasonable.Intents and purposes this data can only.Be accessed by the parties who are.Involved in this agreement now the.Interesting part of the question is how.Do we know who's part of this Agreement.How do we know who can actually access.Our data and I think the answer to that.Is you know anyone who's part of this.Multilateral agreement knows who else is.Part of this agreement so you are you.Know as a user you're giving your data.To a company that you trust if if you're.Giving your data to a company you don't.Trust like all bets are off so you know.You've kind of entered into this by.Saying I trust.Howry to deal with my data and.Implicitly you're saying I also agree.That the people that calorie shares this.Data with I also trust but we do get.Into kind of a more you know that that's.A that's a much bigger leap does anyone.Else have any thoughts on kind of.That the trust story here involved with.Personal data.Yes so from my point of view or our.Point of view I think it would make a.Lot of sense if the user would sign.Something like a piece of data that says.I want to or I agree to share my data.With anchor X so also anchor X can later.Odd ZK was he provided conclusive can.Later proof that the use of was was.Informed about that is that the data is.Going to be shared because I signed that.Piece of data so it's it's like in a.Contract between two parties yeah I.Think it's a much clearer story when you.Know a user comes to calorie puts in.Their data clearly they trust carry with.The data and then they actually go to.Send the money and it says we're gonna.Go through tempo I don't know if the UI.Actually tells them what they're going.Through but pretty much this thing I.Want to put my data in for this this.This transfer from you know between.These two companies so I trust that.These two companies will will treat my.Data properly the the question that.Comes up is since we have this.Multilateral agreement can a third.Company come in and just request you.Know request Michael Feldstein data from.From conclusive you know if a kind of.Sketchy company gets so there's I guess.There's two questions here that I have.For the the conclusive product is does.Every party be that's already involved.In the multilateral agreement have to.Agree to a new party entering and then.Second question can any party at any.Time just requests data that's been.Entered into this pool or is it only.Possible when a user agrees that you.Know they want that's the other party.They want involved with their data.Mm-hmm so sorry for dropping off but.They have some internet issues.So so it depends to ask you a question.Because I think it depends on the under.Regulations for example in the u.s.Regulation by law you can share kyc data.No personal data but you can you can.Search every see date right so let's say.For example if europe is the same and by.Law you are allowed to share kyc data.What personal personal information data.Let's say is when an anchor from us is.Doing payments and transaction with an.Icon from euro for example there is no.Need for an agreement because we are not.Sharing personal information you are.Just between ke wifey data and personal.Information yes kyc data for example.I've checked you on the sanction list of.ABI you're not there but it's not.Showing the name it was checked right.Okay I checked you own off at least or.UN list or something else you are not.There right or whatever sanctioned is or.Address match or things like that so you.Don't get in the KYC detain a person any.Personal information but the game.Actually is the result of processing the.Person exactly exactly so the anchor has.To keep the personal information is just.Sent them either the personal.Information or either on just an.Identification or a house or something.That person information we are still.Working on this and if we already have.The KYC for that unique entity or person.We just share the KYC data which doesn't.Contain any personal information.And again that's why I said it depends.Because it depends on the regulation.Like maybe some country or regions.You're not allowed to ship kyc data even.Though it doesn't contains any personal.Information right so for the case of.Sharing personal information like like.We talked about earlier this this this.Process does allow for a receiving.Anchor to pull down the personal.Information like with any said you know.They need to be able to share that with.Regulators they need to know you know.Things actually get data so does that.Process for an anchor actually pulling.Down personal data how is that.Controlled I think that's the control of.Anchor level and sub level I think you.Guys already have this in the first I.Think the first I think it was set three.Or something with Padma Franco to anchor.In which when you were requesting.Personal information for a central.Entity or individual involved in the.Transaction from another anchor that.Anchor would had like a check on this.Information like its shareable or not or.Something like this right so I think the.Death should be and as you guys mention.I think somebody mentioned it should be.A conflict signed between anchors right.To be able to do this either two anchors.Either like but the entity or individual.Level right maybe when you start in a.Transaction you can ask you okay are you.Willing to share your personal.Information and maybe a note if you're.Not willing to sell your personal.Information it means that maybe the.Transaction or something right.But is there any way for someone to say.I'm willing to share my personal.Information with just these two entities.Versus I'm willing to share my personal.Information with anyone involved in the.Multilateral agreement yes I think is.Possible but to be honest I don't know.Whose responsibility it should be like.It should be anchor responsibility to.Collect this data and store it right and.To do the check okay I am I'm allowed to.Share the information with this certain.Entity or individual or with this.Provider let's say or released anchor or.It should be thing.If responsibility to collect this data.And went on this monster that little.Thing just to check if I'm allowed to.Share this right okay we are not trying.To share personal information we are.Trying to share kyc data right so that's.The best purpose okay it seems like an.Aspect that we really need to dig into.And make sure that was a really good.Question I'm glad somebody brought it up.I'm not I'm not certain that we have an.Exact answer for this but it seems like.If if we're gonna have this just this.Way four acres to download personal data.We're gonna need some pretty good.Controls on who can actually do that.Otherwise you know that's it's a broad.Pool of putting your data out there so I.Guess a more straightforward question is.The first one in this multilateral.Agreements how does that pool grow does.Does everybody in the pool have to agree.To every new addition and just one thing.Michael I do want to call attention to.The time so as much as we can eventually.Move the discussion to the 0.3 I think.That that would be great to do so but.Don't want to interrupt you I think I.Think that was we need to dig into that.A bit we did it on the call so yeah.Let's take a look at that next section.Okay great so Andy did you want to give.A bit of an intro on this.Yes of course so we have a bit of.Unusual use case from an anchors.Perspective and considering what we.Discussed so far because we are a.Noncustodial application and we want to.Take part in that directs and process so.Right now we have two approaches that we.Are trying or discussing internally at.Satoshi pay and for those two processes.We have two different there's two.Different flows we have two requirements.Like one each how to how would we take.Part and would we facilitate the direct.Send even though we are not an anchor so.Our use case is actually that we have a.Client who is in charge of their own.Funds they owned their secret key and we.Want to use that iOS and API between.Anchors or to another anchor so like we.One option we are looking into right now.Is that basically it happens anchor -.Anchor and we would need some way to.Initiate the whole payment flow like we.As a third party which need a way to.Tell anchor a descending anger and to.Actually start a payment to anchor B.This is one option that we have the.Other one is from from us from a.Receiving anchors perspective that we.Would basically be the sending anchor in.Some sense but we would actually send.The money from the from the user's.Account from the clients account or.Rather the client sends it and as we're.Non-custodial and for that we would need.To be able and as a direct sent proposal.Of states.That the endpoint is not supposed to be.Public there's like a white list of.Entities that are able to to use that.Endpoint usually anchors we would not.Only be able to to have us white listed.As Toshi pay but we would need to be.Able to have like sub accounts so like.We have a Satoshi pair identity and we.Have our clients and our clients would.Need like the keys of our clients would.Need to be white listed to participate.In that direct indirect send I hope that.Makes it half way clear even though it's.A lot to paint in in the air so maybe we.Can get some kind of thoughts from.Google your Anthony about how they.Imagine the ability to actually take.These as the receiving end of this yes.Yeah it would be based on the piece I.Think that would be the ministering.Forward implementation for every key as.The initiator of a transaction which.Would be such as basic customer we would.Need to know that key I believe the.Accent makes you stop the step turn.Ostentatious key right so we can verify.That an incoming transaction was signed.By your original key so basically we.Just need to know or have a process.Where such a few people would register.Each individual key with us maybe as.Part of their onboarding process or.Something so they would say okay this.Key is lost to me belongs to Stassi she.Paid us to one of such as she pays.Customers and then we would essentially.Whiteness that particular key and when.Second receive API it's being called it.Would need to be authenticated with step.10 so we knew that this transaction was.Signed by this key which was white.Listed to start so yeah I think that.Would be the mystery for yes that sounds.Exactly like what we had in mind and the.Point like what's missing right now from.Our perspective is just that we need.Some some protocol how we do is a retro.String part yes essentially we need to.Come up with a way to actually we could.Go as far as making it suspended say.That it's the same process immiscible.With so we actually have so first off is.It okay if we go ten minutes over since.We kind of got a ten minute late start.I'm good with that.Hey yep my I was just actually messaging.People about that so in fact we can go.Ten or fifteen minutes over so all the.Hard cutoff time being 9:45 a.m.Yesterday cool so in that regard one of.The other things that were working on.Tangentially to this is the ability to.Kind of pre-register kyc so we were.Talking about for you know everything in.The time I hear is person-to-person one.Of the other things that came up post.Business-to-business payments and this.Gets a lot more complicated because.Business you know business KYB know your.Business stuff is a lot more complicated.And less standardized than know your.Customer so this is kind of a manual.Process and you know we're talking to.Tempo who does this manually and and so.It's important to kind of get this done.Ahead of time where we can say you know.If you're gonna want to do business.Let's register you ahead of time and so.We actually have not a set but kind of a.Proposal that we did where it's it's.Essentially an augmentation of sub-12.Is the way to upload customer data to.Somebody but it's it's a it's a protocol.That says I want to register an entity.Here's their personal tell me what.Personal data you need from them I'm.Gonna give it to you and we can see if.You're happy with them yet you need more.I'll give you more data but this might.Be useful.I think Andy you were on that thread.Right have you seen what I'm talking.About yes.Yes I commented something earlier today.Actually I don't know if you saw it I.Just like oh yeah sure sure.Yeah so I wrote that the more I think.About it the more it occurs to me that.It would seem from a protocol level it.Might even seem cleaner to separate the.Actual transfer sets more from the KYC.Sets that were from a kyc set so that.The KYC can be done ahead of time and if.And it could still be done in the moment.You do the transfer because you either.Have not KY seed yet all the k was he.That you or the data that you supplied.It's not enough and in that case it.Would just instead of just telling you.You need to provide more data and like.We do now if would basically it would be.The same but redirect you to the KYC.Endpoint so that's a kyc endpoint would.Become like the single source of truth.For all things kyc but of course is a.Tricky topic because it would require us.To change the existing steps like step 6.Step 24 also so this is a bit of a hot.Topic I guess yeah definitely not eager.To make changes to step 6 - step 24.But for the process of this.If there was a protocol where somebody.Could register a user linked to a.Stellar key or rather a Stellar key and.An optional memo for custodial solutions.Seems like it might allow you to kind of.Do this upfront registering and then.Once once you know Kaori your tempo has.Accepted a client based on this.Registration process then you could you.Know then Satoshi BAE's wallet can.Initiate the transfer using that that.September.Memo come her I guess in your case Ville.It'll just be a key for SEP 10 Mike said.Separation of concerns set wise and this.Is more the engineer talking from a.Satoshi pay perspective everything that.Enables us to also do the KYC ahead of.Time which was a job okay let me share.That with you boo by me I don't think I.Actually sent it to you originally but I.Think I think this can this can allow.For exactly what you're talking about.Yeah as long as you're willing to allow.Us to toship a wallet or a noncustodial.Wallet to register users in this way I.Think we can do that technically it.Doesn't seem that complicated what.You're asking worst-case if it's if it's.Really an issue to have a noncustodial.Client supplies the actual okay wasted.As their personal information.Worst case scenario maybe we can have a.Fallback to an interactive kyc but of.Course it would allow for a much.Smoother on user experience if we could.Supplies the actual data.Yeah we've been focused really on for.This direct sends send receive stuff.We've really been focused on non.Interactive because this is kind of you.Know the this this is a communication.Between two businesses normally if I.Yeah I see what you're saying.Let's try to do.The non-interactive way and if you know.If things really fall apart that we can.Start to look at the interactive you.Know taking a kyc form from the.Receiving anchor and showing it in the.In the wallet similar to how step 24.Does it I don't actually think we're.Going to need to get there.Really.Just gonna stay here the feels that I.Need yeah that sounds good for mind okay.I feel good about that wonderful so do.We feel like we have both kind of a.Short-term wave for how we want to start.Testing and implementing this stuff and.Then kind of a median turn plan for.Building out something more kind of.Sustainable or long-term I think they're.Very similar approaches okay okay it's.Anthony Michael you asked me about step.6.I think last week mm-hmm are you.Thinking of bringing that back or adding.That to this new standard or the.Question I had last week was more kind.Of a maintenance obstetrics so we we had.It seems like everyone the ecosystem.Kind of likes to continue to use step 6.So the thing that was asking about was.Just for security purposes currently.There's a lot of personal information.That's sent over a get request and in.The URL which is URLs are not really.Secure they can be leaked through.Browser history or whatever so we just.Want to change that endpoint to be a.Post request which it sounds like you.Already you already did so it was two.Separate it had nothing to do with this.I don't okay thank you okay great well.So were there any last items that people.Wanted to discuss before before we end.The roundtable for today yeah I have one.More thing actually because I said.That like two paths that we are.Considering right now and we discussed.The second one and this is quite.Actionable but for the first.And we skipped that little bit in this.Case maybe we can do it do it very.Briefly and I just want to hear if.Anchors have some specific thoughts on.That and this is if we were to do the.The direct sending the direct payments.Directly from an anchor to another.Anchor and we would just basically step.In and like we would be the party.Initiating the whole flow in for the.User and we would like just connect the.Dots and the user the user would then.Directly like trend send a payment a.Fiat payment for example to Z sending.Anger and the sending anger upon arrival.Sensor to the receiving anchor and it's.A it's a bit hard to explain now in such.Short term but are there any hard.Feelings from anchors about adding.Support for something like this or not.Adding it like that you allowed some.Other party to kick off the floor.In this process does the sending anchor.Need to know anything about what's.Happening or does it simply accept.Deposits and issue tokens like an anchor.Has always done yes basically.So of course and the anchor stone needs.To to control like the KYC flow request.More data something like that I suppose.But apart from that it's always like.It's always been okay so what I had.Understood from your flow there was you.The wallet itself would be the initiator.Of the transaction and from a receiving.Anchors point of view they care about.Two things one we have good kyc data we.Know who we're dealing with - we've.Received proper payment you know we.Received the tokens we expect to receive.For this payment they don't originally.They were kind of conflated where the.Person who provides the KYC is the same.As the person that sends the tokens I.Don't think that necessarily needs to be.True as long as both things are true.That they as long as both things are.Provided good kose data and proper.Payment do those actually need to you.Know does.If if Satoshi they can provide kyc.Either through if inclusive or through.However the anchor accepts and the.Receipt anchor gets the money they.Expect is that enough because if that's.The case that and the sending anchor.Doesn't doesn't really need to know that.They're part of this payment protocol.They just need to know they've accepted.Some Fiat they've sent a token to an.Address just to say we do that right.Now with some of the crypto anchors like.Papaya bod and not nao BTC what exactly.What do you mean we what is that that.You do essentially we sell the client.Like a nao BTC Bitcoin and then they.Choose to send to the Bitcoin address.They're doing withdraw on that anchor..But it's behind the scenes the client.Doesn't know okay okay that doesn't.Sound too bad an address that's.Whitelisted we don't really care like if.He is a client of the partner or.Whatever the case same thing long as we.Receive a fiat payment corresponding to.A section we don't really care as long.As it a right if the only question I.Think really is do we have to connect.The income via payment with the KYC of a.Particular wallet address if we have to.Do that that is also possible I think it.Can be done because.We were first of all we already have a.Business relationship and a business.Agreement with a special tree for.Example and then there's going to be.White listing up one body or any one.Else address so as long as we move.Through that process when any.Send/receive.Transaction that comes in we know that.It's one that that's you launch the.Strategy behind is rating whiteness.Didn't we already have accuracy for it.So yeah it's a it's ounds overly.Complicated to expect that this sending.You know a stunning anchor who's not.Actually originating with this payment.Is going to become a part of it but it.Seems totally straightforward for them.To issue the tokens to the wallet and.Then the wallet sends the money and in.That case it's coming from an address.That's been whitelist it has been you.Know registered in kyc properly.Yeah that's maybe the most the most.Straightforward thing to do.Cool III had one question on this.External memo field for Satoshi pay.Because I've seen it before that wallets.Who are initiating transfers they often.Need their own reference to come in so.Then essentially this two memo field is.An external memo and then then then our.Memo can you explain a bit how you.Should be that working oh yeah.So from our point of view like you're.Referring to the external memo and the.In like the Stellar transaction memo.Right exactly so we don't really care.About the Stellar transaction memo but.On pay out we would like to be able to.Add a custom a custom text to the actual.Bank transfer reference that text that's.Attached to those bank transfers usually.We we know that of course you guys have.To have to add your own your own text.For for referencing it later I guess but.Our goal is to also include some some.Text or some code of ours so that the.Receiving party can like the the text.That we want to add is primarily.Specified by our client so if if Anthony.You are our client in this case you can.Enter some some ID where you know or.Case is payment X and you would enter.That in our wallet and we would sent.This to Temple on withdrawal on payout.And then the idea is that temple as this.Payment acts memo that you anthony as.The user specified - is that - that.Actual bank transfer text.Great thank you.Okay awesome so if that is kind of one.Of our last trailing comments then I'm.Going to go ahead and wrap this session.Up I think we've had a lot of great.Discussions really excited about the.Progress we made on the multilateral kyc.Conversation so Thank You Claudio and.Also on the non-custodial wallet.Integration into the direct sub.Transaction so lots of stuff there I.Know that there were a few points that.We are going to need to follow up on.That's the nature of these discussions.So things will continue to be dynamic.But thank you so much everyone for your.Time and participation today.And thanks for everybody who is tuning.In thank you sir thanks all right.
