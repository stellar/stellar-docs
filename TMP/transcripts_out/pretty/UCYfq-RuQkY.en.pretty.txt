Hello and welcome to this week's .Stellar Developer Meeting this new.Format where we are trying out twitch.And we're trying a new format where.We do shorter presentations so let's.See how it goes this hopefully this.Will go smooth but it is the first time.We're trying a new platform so there.Might be some some smaller hicups .With my with me today I have I have.Alberto which I've had the pleasure.Meeting several times at at different. SDF events and and he is going to.Talk about trustless work today so.Please go ahead and introduce yourself.And share your screen Alberto okay let.Me give me a second to present hello.Everybody my name is Alberto as he said.I'm from Costa.Rica I am building Cress work please.Confirm if you can see my screen because.I have one monitor so I'm not.Sure but I think you.Do.Okay and yeah ER we are building.Trustless work trustless work is ESC.Infrastructure for the new economy so.Basically.To to understand a little bit what I'm.Talking about basically in very.Simplistic terms an escro is a neutral.Secure way to hold money or funds while.The ass while something is happening H.The most common use of escrow that you.Might know is real estate real estate.Escros which in this case we use a an.Agent or an escro agent like a bank to.Hold the funds while the legal.Inspections and the paperwork happens.For a house but we also have digital.Escrows in the case of eBay Who as a.Marketplace they hold the fun while the.Merchant actually delivers the product.And same thing for upwork which holds.The fund while the freelancer completes.The the.Deliverable but if you try to build this.Today with Fiat payments it'll be next.To Impossible and that's because .Legacy Astros as I call it have a huge.Problem which is Fiat payments Fiat.Payments require banking they are very.Costly they're very slow they're very.Limited in flexibility they have.Transparency and they're obviously full.Of frictions that if you're here.Watching a seller call you understand.The frictions that fi payments provide.So not anymore at trustless work we're.Building the esro infrastructure so.Basically we're abstracting the.Configuration deployment and interaction.With smart contracts to create smart.Escros which provide the same.Functionality as escrs and even more.Because they're cheap they're fast.They're permissionless a transparent and.Global and so in this way marketplaces.E-commerce directories trade file and.Many more use cases are unlocked that.Can actually use this functionality.Without requiring a blockchain.Expertise what we're building in.Trustless work is also an ecosystem so.We're building in an open source way or.All the asro tools the templates and the.Dev tools so that it becomes as simple.As possible to initialize fund sign.Review approve and release payments over.Sell Network we are focused on usdc.Which is again it's the one that brings.Less friction We Believe for volatility.But we can all already use this on.Any asset admitted issued on Sellar.Network some of our traction a little.Bit of the story we started working this.In July we got into the Astro Hacker.House is sponsored by Sellar and Draper.University that's where we built the.Version one of the smart contracts the.API and the documentation which we.Launched on testet on a Costa Rican.Hackathon we also got accepted to the.Stellar Draper U Embark program which is.Where I'm at right now and we also.Participated in the only dust OD hack.Number 10 which allowed us to accelerate. our development we got the escro.Version two done in an open source and.The escro UI version one we also.Recently got awarded the an SCF Grant so.Thank you very much for that right now.We're building the API version two.Because we're preparing for OD hack.Number 11 where again if you want to.Contribute you're more than invited to.Contribute or another esro UI version.Too H some partner Integrations and.There are some even research and and. tasks that we're going to add there H.We're getting ready for demo day on.Draper U which is by the end of January.And we are going to be launching on.Mayet around q1 2025 probably around.March H trustless work I mentioned only.Dust and this is something really.Interesting that is happening with.Trustless work is that our hackathon.Projects the the ones that were in the.In a tested launch have evolved into.Becoming a vertical on their own so each.One of these projects was part by.Themselves of the only hack of the OD.Hack number 10 they got contributors by.The themselves and they got funds to to.To initialize their development and.Mature their their development so.Directly or indirectly I think trustless.Work has over 70 developers contributing.To the ecosystem and all of these.Projects are going to become templates.For Integrations that are going to make.Easier to integrate trustless work into.Into all use cases probably and incoming.We have a casino poker use cases who.Want to use escrow and trade F use cases. one that I want.To to stand out is KFI KFI was able to.Build in a week .Crowdfunding H for social impact.Solution using our escros so.Basically they use our escros as a.Deposit account where people can deposit.Funds and they the payment is released.To the foundation by Milestones so yeah.We are getting into AI driven.Development also to accelerate how we.Are integrated in in common use.Cases we are a core team of four and.Myself Alberto I'm the CEO and product.Lead I have experience as product.Manager even from Project since Corda to.Ethereum to exerp base and Stellar and.Joel Armando and calev they are the.Development team they have been.Contributing to Stark net and ethereum.Ecosystems and now they moved into.Stellar also because of this project.And we're also backed by a community of.Over 180 developers from latam from.Latin America H which is called Dojo.Coding shout out to them they're.Probably going to be here and yeah.That's what we're doing in in.Trustless work the this is a linked to.My LinkedIn if you want to connect I.Will gladly do so if you want to.Contribute please do and yeah we're.Building again the the escrow.Infrastructure for the new economy and.I'm very happy that it's going to happen.On.Stellar great thank you for for the.Presentation I think it's it's very.Exciting.How fast you have really been able to to.Spin this up and and already starting to.Get traction just a reminder are you.On test net or are you on Main net right.Now we're on test net right now yeah so.Yeah there's a lot of things we have to.Figure out ER be U before we launch a.Main with real funds H we won't make.Revenue until we have we're on Main it.So yeah but we don't want to rush that.We've gotten support from the community.Am from Draper and seller Ventures so.Yeah we we want to take our time with.That yeah so so anyone who wants to to.Explore what you're doing they can.Go to your website I have seen your.Documentation is pretty good so I could.Actually start building on on your your.Platform right now if I wanted to Yes .That's the idea yeah I've gotten really.Much into deil also I'm part of deil uni.H so I've been learning a lot about that.And yeah we're working on our docks and.Making as simple as possible to go from.Zero to hello world so yeah yeah I think.That that we talked about previously.Was was open sourcing and and can you.Share a little bit about your experience.With open sourcing your projects sure .Yeah it's been crazy I'm from product.Management so I am used to like over.Communicating things and features like.To to to make things clearer but being.Open source really has been like a a a.Great effort like to think about who's.Gonna come I don't know them they have.No context on our product so how we can.Make like their life easier and gladly. our core team Joel arando and cev.They they have experience already you.Know us so they have been in the other.Side of Open Source contributions also.So they were they knew like the best .Yeah like the formats how to explain it.H we're also leveraging AI also like.I've learned that Cod rabbit really.Helps like to to start to to describe H.Things and and yeah look for.Improvements but yeah I think that the.Traction like how we were able like to.Build like I think by faes we got like.The hackathon as phase one so we built.Like trustless work was an API we got.Like these five teams building hackathon.Projects and after od10 like they're all.Like more mature like each one got like.20 contributors so it's crazy how we.Were able like to start building this.Ecosystem and now it's really.Interesting like to connect them like.Both that we doing marketplaces to.Connect them so they can start also.Accelerating their own and focus on.Different aspects of it h so yeah I'm.Really excited on the on the.Opportunities and the possibilities that.This provides like to build that.Ecosystem and to start even mapping.Contributions like now we're moving.Everything to GitHub like even the.Documentation all the work I do because.It's not you know it's hard to track.Even what I do so now we want to track.It so because again we want to be able.To to leverage that as much as possible.And yeah we're getting we're learning a.Lot and it's really interesting that's.Great you mentioned in your.Presentation real estate because.That's probably where most of us know.Escros from but can you maybe talk a.Little bit about what kind of projects.That are interested in using your.Service what kind of categories what.Kind of Industries they're in because I.Know it's not just real estate companies.Yeah yeah I've gotten a lot of interest.From Real Estate that's for sure ER I I.Myself I explain that we are.Infrastructure provider like we are a.Technical partner like we are not.Building for real real estate but they.Can obviously leverage us so this.Unlocks like for example for real estate.Agents or even lawyers to deploy their.Own escros and not require this banking.Agent that may take three days two days.And where's the wire kind of like.Experience which is every what I get as.Feedback but even more than that for.Example a trade f is really interesting. I'm from Costa Rica I mentioned.Earlier Costa Rica is a was just invited.To join a.A trade Union with 14 countries in the.Pacific so it starts becoming really.Interesting like how are we going to.Handle payments you know with the new.Countries new economies that we don't.Have like a lot of H Financial.Relationship with Malaysia Singapore.Peru those kind of countries so trade f.Is something that's really interesting.Right now for us H but also for example.One of the teams buil used our ESR to.Create a security deposit solution for.House rentals for example if you think.About it like every time you do a.Security deposit in any Hospitality car.Rentals house rentals like it's always.The card processor and you never know.Where the money is and it's always.Blocked for a certain amount of time and.Nobody's responsible for that and yeah.They created this because escr are.Configurable in that sense they created.An escrow that again is release back to.Myself unless there is a unless there is.A dispute so that's like security.Security deposits and if you look for.Security deposit technology there's like.Not much out there H so it becomes.Really interesting like to start .Experimenting with this and seeing for.Example if we do a plugin for I don't.Know Cloud BS or like plugin for jeta or.Do this in integrate this in Shopify and.Different types of of interactions that.Are becoming really interesting and.Again we can.Only aboard those by being open source.And getting as much contri to get this.Band with because yeah if it was.Internal resources it would be.Impossible impossible yeah yeah and it.Sounds like it's it's not just crypto. companies or crypto projects that are.Interested in in in in in using your.Service actually maybe the opposite.Maybe the opposite yeah yeah and that's.Al also one of the main reasons we chose.Stellar the the anchor Network and the.Unram and offrs partners yeah we.Don't we want them to be like have a.Good experience be able to send an a be.Able to send a wire it depends on the.Use case like even credit card or or.Card processing so so yeah there's all.These partners that we need to explore.And start integrating or make it as.Simple as possible to integrate four.People ER platforms we're going to use.Our.Technology so yeah we're really.Excited for that .What other one yeah it's mostly that.Crowdfunding is becoming really.Interesting also like for Aid like if we.Make it very simple to deploy like this.Kind of esrs to receive payments from.Globally it it's really interesting for.Aid also so there are a lot of.Opportunities to abstract the.Blockchain and and yeah become yesterday.I said I was preing yesterday and they.Said we wanted to become like the stripe.Of.Escros and which is ambitious for me.And somebody corrected me and said like.No let's do the Salesforce for esos so.So so yeah that's the kind of.Infrastructure that we want to to.Provide and I think a EST Stellar is.Perfect for that I think we are in a.Great moment for that stable coin.Adoption is like booming and and yeah.Hopefully hopefully we're right on time.Yeah yeah it's it's it's amazing to see.See what your building and and how fast.You're doing it it's it's really it's .It's a huge inspiration also also.That you really Embrace open source and.I think I think that's that's you're.Really shown that that by embracing open.Source and putting it out there you.Get a lot of contributions you get a lot.Of people playing around with it so.So yeah that's that's that's great to.See as well yeah the verticals can also.Like add like we have a fixed fee for.Trustless work like on escros.Which is 3% and they can add an extra.Fee so like if they like they become the.Security deposits like product on top of.Us like they there is a huge business.Model to have so like that's why we're.Taking like such a small tiny cut.Because we want to provide like that.Layer zero of infrastructure so that all.Their products can come and build upon.Us and offer this functionality which.It's mostly like people have.Experimented with this but it's mostly.Untested in a lot of niches use cases.And verticals all around like every time.I talk to someone I get like 10 ideas of.Things we can build back and yeah only s.Open source is the only way honestly do.You have any any idea when you will.Actually go live on.Mainnet according to our seller.Community Fund Grant around March April.Is is what we want we're targeting for.That .Yeah we're still like version two of the.Contract is already like the API goes.After that and like we have all that.That kind of flow H so yeah I think I.Think it's really feasible by by March.Yeah I think it's it's also quick. that's it's it's only like three.Four months away so yeah part of the.Grant part of the Community Fund Grant.Also has this auditing H so I'm also.Looking forward for that.Because that would really like help and.Also that's why open source makes a lot.Of sense so as much eyes as possible own.Our contracts and so on so we get get.More feedback which is one of the best. validation techniques I think yeah.Yeah yeah I think I think when when.You're holding other people's funds.The the auditing part is super critical. it's it's just just.Having a third party.Verify your code go through your code.And and be able to say that that this.That our code and our solution has been.Audited by a third party I think it also.Builds a lot of trust so yeah so so yeah.It's it's I think it's it's a great.Thing that we have that in as a part of.Our Community Fund program yeah yeah.It's really useful looking forward for.That okay great great thank you so much.It's always a pleasure to talk to you.And it's super exciting to see.You're making and what you're building.On Stellar it's I think it's an.Inspiration for everyone in the.Community thank you thank you for.Joining sure my pleasure talk to you.Later.Bye okay and then let me.See then as a part of the new the new. format we we're trying out here .We'll we'll try to do the the.Presentations a little bit shorter and.Then have have maybe two or three.Presentations per per per time this.Time I we don't have a second.Presentation but instead I am going to.Experiment with a little bit with some.Live coding I have been testing out.Some AI tools that can assist you.In in building smart contracts on.Stellar and and I think I think it's.Interesting and seeing from the.Perspective that if you're new to.Building smart contracts in soran or.On Stellar then then some of these tools.Can be be a great help so let's see.If I can if I can share my.It's it's loading here let see if I can.Make it a little bit bigger.Yeah okay so what I'm going to show.Here is just the hello world.Application the the demo example app.We have show how to run that this.Inside cursor cursor is is an AI.Assisted IDE you can use for many.Different software language.And just for the fun of it I tested it.Out not that long time ago to see.Because I was pretty sure it's probably.That's probably not support for for for.Soran but I to to my surprise that.That was actually pretty good support.So I'm just going to go through a very.Simple example of how you can use it and.And I think this this might be very.Helpful if you're new to developing on.On on Stell soran so so let's let's just.Give it a give it a try it looks very.Much like like like other tools you.Are you're used to using the it the the.The ID is is pretty pretty standard.Looking and I have a terminal and I.Will just try to I'll just try to .To set up the the hello world smart.Contract.So let's try.This okay so what we have here.Is a new smart contract it's the hello.World smart contract and we can try to.Open the code.Here and this is very much like what.You're used to seeing in your in your..IDE and we can do the same we can in.Other IDs so let's let's just try to run.This.Let's run a.Directory and it just takes a minute and.Then it should hopefully run the the.Test without any issues while this is.Running the what I want to show here.Is I'm going to take this very simple.Smart contract and then I'm going to add.Some function it to it what I want to.Do is I want to store the value to that.Is provided by by by the the caller the.Invoker and if there is already a value.Stored.And we are not providing a value when we.When we invoke the the smart contract so.If two is empty then I'll just take the.Last value that's a very simple very.Simple smart contract but but it.Actually shows shows .A a pretty a good example of what what.You're doing like when you're messing.Around with code for the first time or.When you're if you're very new to it so.Let's try that out so.First I want to.Store I can see it is already remembered.What I've done before that's it's not.Supposed to do that but what what I.Do here in in in the in the IDE is.That I press command and K I'm using.Macbook so it's command and then I I.Write. let's see let's say say store.To in.Storage so I just type what what I want.To accomplish what I want to do and then.I click the generate.Button and then it will make a.Suggestion and I can see that this is.Not just some generic rust code this is.Actually this is actually soran code.And I think this looks pretty good so.Let's just accept.That so so now we have a line here that.Was generated by the AI that.Stores the the value from the string.From two when it's provided to our.Instant.Storage I can I can then say Okay .I only want to use this storage.If if the two value here when we.Invoke the smart contract if there's no.Value here then I want to use the then I.Want to use the the the stored value.From the first time we ran it so so.Let's let's try to to have it do that.Again I press command and.Okay and then then let's just.Say and again I just describe it it if.If two is.Empty.Use two from.With okay so it actually initializes a.New in new variable and it checks if two.Is is has a length that's equal zero and.If it if it is then we get it from from.Storage and if not then we just return.The one we got from the the parameter.From an invoking the smart contract this.This looks pretty good so so let's .Let's just do.That and having this line of code here.Is actually fine because this if if.It's valid then we want to update the.Value in storage and if it's if it's .Just getting the same from from.Before if if two was empty then it's.Just restoring the same value so that's.That's fine too so so let's let's.Let's try to run this I'm not going to.Build and deploy it to test net I'm just.Going to use the test case and if we.Go to.Test first I just want to store.This so if we see the test case here.That is provided it comes out of the box.When we when we create the the.Smart contract .Then.We provide Dev as a string when we.Invoke the contract and then we check.For it if it contains Dev but because we.Also want to test for the case where.There there's not a string not a.String when we invoke it let's create.The test case for that as.Mutable and then we just add.An empty string here so when we run this.Because we ran this one first where we.Stored Dev the dev string in storage we.Should still get get Dev when we run.This test even though we don't provide a.String here so.Let's let's try to run this.Error if we go back to the the code here. this way of setting what type of.Output we're getting is probably.Throwing an error so let's just specify.That this is a string.And let's see if we can run it.Again okay so it it now completed so.That means that first it both test test.Cases here were were passed the whole.Test file as a as a whole was was.Completed and without errors so when we.Provide Dev as a parameter first when we.Invoke the contract we store that in in.The storage and then the second time we.Run it without without the value and it.Still gets dep because it's pulling it.From from the the the.Storage now I know a little bit more.About storage on on in sorond so I.Know that this is instant storage .There we have three different types of.Storage we have the the instant storage.We have the the temporary storage and we.Have the the the permanent storage so is.This the right one to use and and that's.A neat little feature that I can use I.Can actually ask the IDE if this is the.Right if if this is the right source.To use so I use command and.L and let's.Just delete.These and then I can.Ask.Type should I.Use let's see what I.Get so here we actually getting. it.Says this is actually not a relevant.Example let's try try to rephrase.This is more a front end.Answer. if I ask is.At seems it looking like I actually had.It .This is typical when you do something.Live let's see .What yeah this was a little bit more.Along the lines of what what it returned.When I was testing it out but but I.Can actually hear in the IDE.Ask what the different storage types are. and it mentions instant storage.Persistent storage and temporary storage.And then it gives me an example of how.To use.It and then it gives me some some more.Information I have actually had it .Reply to me that because of the the.Nature of the the smart contract the.Functionality that I that I I'm building.Here that I had pick the right storage.Type that instant storage would be the.Best type it it was that that's what.I was hoping it would show again but but.We can actually instead of having to go.To documentation or or go to to other.Places to see and to learn more about it.We can actually just use the chat and.And and get some some valuable feedback.At least at least some of the times so.So yeah this this was a this was a quick.Example of.How AI is is going to help us build.Smart contracts as well I was really.Pleasantly surprised when I saw that .That it it it knows how to how to assist.Me when I'm building smart contracts and.And I think it's it's it's a it it's.Really relevant for especially .Developers who are new to seller new to.Soran that that they can get a little.Bit of of help without leaving the.The ID so so yeah I hope I hope this.Was helpful and maybe you you feel.Like like like trying it yourself .I have just tried this tool it's cursor. and it's a free version I'm using.It's not an endorsement or anything it's.Just the one that I happen to to try out. but but yeah try to play with it.And I think I think it's it's it's.It's great fun and and eventually I.Think it it'll be it'll help me to get.More productive when I'm.Coding okay that's that's all I had.For today I don't know if there's any.Questions we can take questions if if.There is anything.I see Chris has been very active.Answering questions and commenting as.Well.Discussion okay if if there's not.Anything else then thank you.Everyone for joining I hope this this. that you like this format we will .We will start we will continue to to.Experiment and try different things and.And I think I think it's it looks.Like twitch is giving us a lot less.Technical issues than we've had in the.Past when we've done done these.Meetings on Discord so so so yeah.We'll we'll continue here and and.Shortly we will send out and I'll share.That on Discord as well we'll have a.We'll have a a a sign up page where you.Can sign up for notifications so when.When we when we plan a new session and.We go live you you can get an email.Notification that was one of the that.Was one of the suggestions that we got.From from the session we did where we.Talked about some of our plans and what.We would like to do and and was looking.For feedback and and and we are.Working on setting up an email list.So so you can subscribe to that and and.Get notifications when when we when.We have a a new planned meeting so.So thank you everyone for joining we'll.See you in a week.
