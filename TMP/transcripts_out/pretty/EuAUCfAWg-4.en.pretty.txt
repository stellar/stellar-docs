Hi everyone and welcome to this week's.Stellar Developer Meeting.This week at.Stellar we just concluded the the latest.Cohort in the incubator collaboration.We have with Draperu and I thought.Since we just wrapped this up and 20.Teams. graduated from from the incubator.Program I thought it could be.Interesting to invite someone who went.Through the program last year.So today.I have I have the the founder of.Flashback in the studio.So yeah, please.Introduce yourself and let us know what.You're working on. Hello guys. so my name is Briu . so co-ounder of flashback and so.Yeah we were part of this first and.Initial batch for the draper cross .Ster unbug program which was I.Think between yeah November 2024 to.February 2025. and so yeah some just a bit of.Background about myself.So I have PhD.In computer science mainly in machine.Learning artificial intelligence. so.I did that for seven eight years. big.Patient with in AI and all you can use.AI you know with cloud technologies and.The fact that today AI is very related.To cloud technologies. I got very.Curious about what we call the.Decentralized physical infrastructure.Network the cloud storage cloud.Computing sovereignty data protection.Etc etc and of course since 2016 I.Discovered the cryptocurrency space. initially with project like lisk and.Arc so very old project I would not.Say I'm no g but close to.And yeah, I discovered the blockchain.More kind of patient and since March.2023, I decided to start my.Entrepreneurship journey start to to.Build my first solution which was a.Decentralized storage network. trying to in fact build something.For fast data retrieval because if you.Are trying if you already tried you know.Fon iwave it's made for archival data .But once you want to do what storage and.To use it in a very frequent way is not.Very compatible for this kind of usage.So we wanted to step and to try to build.Something there but you know building.Solution going through for one year and.A half we understood like we talking.With thousand of I was hundred and.Thousand of funders with different.Conferences par blockchain week ETH.ProgCC.Token 2049 we discover quickly that yes.In fact flashback was born from an.Simple problem it's a vunderlooking.Problem everyone is facing that but .Yeah if you want custom I have a small.Presentation to help people to go.Through. Yeah let's let's go to the.Presentation. Okay.Here it is.Okay.So, yes, Flashback is an AI power code.Defecification solution.So we want to be this unified interface.For developers and companies to be able.To diversify with centralized and.Decentralized cloud providers.We want.Make we want to make it cheaper, simpler.And more flexible to you to deeper your.Data storage and in fact make the mic.Cloud journey something that you can.Start at the beginning of your.Entrepreneurship or when you want to.Start to build a project.So in fact basically we have the large.Vendors you know Google cloud AWS.Microsoft Azure they are fast and.Reliable we know them well they have a.Lot of stacks but the thing is that.They're very expensive I think we know.We as a developer we know this me of .If you want to justify your please you.Just have to say AWS it's very well.Known very difficult to understand.All you are doing your expenses is and.At the same time most of the company.When they started to deploy with one.Provider they depose so much solution on.The top that they have this fun looking.Issue which is the major issue today.Because it doesn't allow you to be great.Easily to another provider so you're.Stuck with the bunder.And the other side we have the.Decentralized solutions more affordable. more privacy rel compliant. and low cost but think that fon for.Virus.They're using the blockchain.Technology and they're using a lot of.Protocols and decentralized consensus.Which makes the system more slower and.So at the same times very difficult for.Developers to know the tax and or to.Build efficiently with this solution.So yeah for a company very quickly at.The beginning of the journey you can.Spend hundred hours even more spend a.Lot of money to deploy with one or two.Or three different providers to build.Your own infrastructure it can be up to.25% of your revenue you're going to.Inject in fact to develop this at the.Same time DP technologies very.Interesting technologies but it's only.0.1% of the market size So I would say.That it's still a niche a niche that can.Be explored by people but people do not.Have the time to explore them.So it is.Why we have decide to build flashback.So with flashback you can do a cloud.Divers it's cloud diversification.Platform.So in fact you're going to.Have three different advantages.The first one you will be able to reduce.Your cost because by deploying on.Flashback what you can do is indeed play.With centralized providers quite.Expensive but sometimes play with.Decentralized providers you can have.This easy access to deep technologies.We want to make it very easy like you.Connect you deploy your bucket.You.Connect your bucket with this .Providers which are some specific.Services on the top to deploy buckets.And then of course we want to make the.Mutual deployment seamless not only for.Large companies but at some time for.Startups for five coders anyone that.Want to indeed start at the beginning of.The development of of their technology.To have a multi cloud approach and so to.Not to get right the bundle looking.Issue.I think it's mainly for the main.Presentation, but what I can do is.Perhaps if it's okay to make like a.Little live demo of the platform. Sure, let's do that. Okay, let's go.,. deos is always fun. Live demo is always fun, you know. Yeah,. it's let's let's see what's u Okay, I.Can share the screen and just get used.To the system.I will share my work.Can I share my.Work screen?
Okay, let's go like this.It would be easier because we're going.To jump between my spider and .Okay, great.So,.This is the platform.Very simple. so with the platform of.Course you can read about the platform.So it's platform.flashback.tech tech and.Of course you can learn more you have a.Documentation I just open here the.Documentation you can go through the.Documentation.A lot of information about indeed what.We are building why we're building this. you have introduction storage want to.Make it as transparent as as informative.As possible for people and of course you.Have some guides to help you to create.Your buckets repository configure.With the system uploaded on the files.So today we are focusing on the optic.Storage which is the first layer.I will.Say that any kind of cloud solution but.Indeed in the future want to have.More features according to what.Developers can bring us what developers.Can bring us in term of feedback and.Information what they want to have in.This platform.So feel free as well to.To to give any kind of feedback.you.Have a lot of API references if you are.More in depth of indeed interacted with.Our flashback API.So we we are trying to make it this as.Flexible as as possible for developers.And indeed being able to to to play.With the platform in the best way.So.Let let me.Of course you can sign up sign up.With your Google or GitHub account.You couldn't create otherwise you know.Email password it's okay and of.Course login so in this case I'm going.To log with my Google account.Just a few time.And here.Of course.You have the platform so the the.Made we try to make things very simple.To understand what's going on at the.Same time on the microord level.So the.Idea is to abstract the fact that you're.Going to work with different code.Providers or to provide you all the.Information to understand how you can.Interact with different code providers.So you have an overview page where.Indeed you can have some links to the.Documentation you need and to start your.Journey with the platform. some statistics transfer packet.Activity so the packet activity.Is part of the cloud storage where we.Have the repository and buckets so let's.See the buckets so I won't go deep in.Term of what is a bucket I think people.Who already are using no AWS or GCP.Or some S3 compatible solution can.Indeed understand what is a bucket so.Here in fact it's with we are starting.Kind of flashback buckets to connect.Your buckets from AWS or GCP to the.Flashback system.So very briefly I want.To go far but for instance if you are.Using AWS you can have different.Buckets.So here you have like three or.Four different buckets and indeed you.Can indeed find this bucket here.So two.Connects.Let's see if we can just cancel this one.For instance.Deleted.Sure if it's going to work.Ah okay.Thank you. so to connect a bucket you have.Different ways to connect your bucket.You can connect your bucket with GCP AWS.Azure.So Azure is bit different.Every provider has its own concept of.All you can store you can do object.Storage with the cloud.So today we.Tested these five providers.You can.Find FCON.So we're using in fact.Through FCON we're using AAV which is an.S3 compatible provider on the top of.Finch system is S3 compatible.But .Feel free as well if you subscribe to.The platform and want to try it to test.The the other S3 compatible providers.Yeah, you can try I know there is.Some pinata stuff like this.So feel.Free to get your API key stuff like this.And to set up your system.But for.Instance, if you're using.And then IWS, so let's see, I'm going to.Give a label a label for my my bucket.And see look.I'm going to create a.New bucket on my account.This way I can.Show you that.Can work.So let's create a bucket on my.AWS account.Oh, come on.You prepare.Everything to be log and you're log out.Huh?
So, let's see if we can go fast.So, let's see if we can go fast.Sign inh.No way.See later.Just want to skip for.Now.Of course, always set up a lot of.Security.There.But yeah, let's create a bucket.So, we're in the we're going to.Create a bucket that say like the.Thieves. AWS buckets.And PH.Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.We're just so you can go through these.Different stuff depending on you're.Working with its but of course for us.And for the purpose of the demonstration.We're just going to create the bucket.Directly.Here we are.And so this field bucket I can just keep.The name here.So it's good to there is.Some information to provide of course in.The platform to be able to set up your. but you need let's say that.It's my VSS.Fivebs.Here some stuff. so yeah if I show.You my secret and access key the I'm.Not sure I'm sharing my work screen,.Right?
So,. yeah, I can I can pause it for a.Moment if you want. Oh, yeah.Just if I can just this way.Yeah, in this way I can just. perfect.Thank you, custom. Thank you for my privacy. so, let me find my keys and.Information like this.So there is a delegation system as well.Where you can delegate instead of indeed.Setting up the API keys and the secrets.Where we have to store it and to split.It in different servers.You can use a.Delegation system which allow you in.Fact to not share with us this kind of.Secrets or to keep a kind of a better.Security for you and your privacy.Okay, just a minute.Just.This one.Okay, I'm just going to copy paste.One second.Okay, you can share again my screen.I.Think you're custom. So you see my screen normally. Yeah.We So we said key secret key in.This way.I can create my packets and.Too many requests.What did what did I.Do?
.No worries.It's part of the test.Instant navigation.So what we're going.To do is that we are we're assuming that.You create your account.You can do that.With GCP as well.So same for GCP you have all the.Information to provide.And according to what you you want to.Provide it's I have a sound from my.Side Kirsten I don't know if you have.The same. you have one. okay no I have a strange sound in my.Ear anyway so depending on the.Different information you have to.Provide so Google cloud storage is.Different information.So of course the.Best is to refer to create the bucket.For instance to get the information or.Or to create the bucket.So there.Some information to provide to connect.Your bucket with with a solution.So once you indeed provide your.Bucket so it's create your bucket you.Have this status in fact we're using a.Technology which called the bridge node.You can as well find some information in.In the documentation.So we explain what.Is the bridge node and indeed the.Purpose of the bridge node.So we have.Some region we're covering.Bridge node is mainly in fact a system.That allow us to interact with the.Different providers.It's our AP.Technology and it's where in fact we can.Get and collect different metrics of.Your different buckets.And so of course once you create your. buckets you can create what we call a.Repo.So we have we we have created I.Created this morning in different.Buckets and of course you have this.So when you want once you want to.Create a repo you can call it any names.You want like repo 6 five like this you.Can add one or two packets different.Because let's GCP one create.I should I should disconnect in fact I.Think so.Anyway so I continue.Say that you just. yeah yeah it's anation but it's okay.It's part the. yeah it just went live.This this .This this just went live and you.Already told me that anyone who use it.You would appreciate feedback because it.Is in the very early stage of being.Live.So if if any of you try it out .I I know I know feedback is very.Appreciated.So these things happen. Exactly.We have a button to give a lot.Of feedback.So feel free to give any.Kind of feedback. indeed it we we.Started to develop this in fact .Just straight after the the so all this. concept since February and then.We want to add this Stellar concept.Of the pin we have but we can come come.Back on it later and so in fact when we.Once you have a repo in fact and the.Repo allow you to indeed have your.Different buckets so you have the GCP.AWS buckets and you can create to API.Keys.So here I create an API keys which.Allow me in fact I will try to make it a.Very simple demo if it's working .To test any storage but indeed for.Instance if I want to store so I have a.Repo I provide some access key.Secret key so of course I did it in in.JS and stuff like this and of course if.We can make this little example we are.Going to transfer this genus bill. I.Took the the text of the genus bill and.Now we're going to create the genus bill.And copy eight. so let's go.So right now we're storing. with an S3 endpoint to S3 buckets.We can see that we store something.We.Can always check that is working.But if.We're looking the second AWS buckets, we.Should probably see this.We have a lot.Of test.P8 which is here. but of course what.Is very funny is to see if in our you.Know Google buckets from an S S3.Endpoint we can get something there.We're going to copy paste in term of.Bucket name which is great because GCS.And AWS is using some same .Wording. so let me go on the.You can find in fact duplicate.Names directly on the report details.This one is the GCP one.I'm going to.Copy paste and.And here we are.Good.cut.And we're going to send this same copy.To the GCP.So we have an S3 end points.And we're sending to DCP.Okay, thanks.To in fact this bridge node which is.This address.Okay, so we can check it is .So of course .Alpha vision right now I just show.You with an S3 endpoints to store with.GCS and AWS. you can try with Azure.Through the the tutorials.Indeed provide some feedback if it's.Working or not.It's a truly alpha.Vision.We're going to do a more stable.Vision in September with indeed more.Better UI and some improvements .Such as the private bridge nodes because.Today the bridge nodes are hosted by.Flashback.But the idea indeed is to .To to let you to be able to deploy this.Node in your tenants.And so to manage.Your your strateging.My screen should work like this.Okay,.Perfect.So it's globally all about .The presentation about this little live.Demo with all the bugs we got. but.Yeah, of course it's still an alpha.Vision, an improved beta vision .For for for flashback and our road map.Is very simple.We want indeed stabilize.All of this.It's always a complex.Features.If it was simple you will.Have this everywhere.So we decided to.Take this challenge and and thanks to.Stella, we we have this chance to indeed.Push it with Stella.We have this .In the Stellar community fund for the one.Who are interesting.There is in fact a.Second product and feature called the.Flashback DP where in fact we as you can.See in fact with this platform you.Interact with the platform with the.Service level of cloud providers.Of course it's still still the services.But if you want to interact with I.Would say data centers or in a higher.Privacy model you the the flashback.DP will allow you in fact to interact.With the data center is going to ask is.Hardware a software connect is bridge.Nodes and then connect to the DBN.Marketplace and so the Stellar is.Stellar is going to play a big key role.There because we're going to deploy all.Smart contract with Stellar to indeed.Manage as marketplace as the same times.To collect thanks to our bridge.Nodes to our smart contracts all the.Quality of services agreements and all.The metric related to that.So in the.Marketplace what you're going to find as.A consumer you're going to connect to.The flashback DPIN platform.You're.Going to find different offers from.You're going to.Select the ones you want.Then these.Ones are going to give you thanks to the.Bridge note which is S3 compatible and.Stuff like this.We believe that they're.Going to use you know like system like.Mio.So they are going to give you an.API keys and stuff like this.So you can.Already interact with in in S3 in a very.Easy way and of course then once you.Decide and you have the right agreement.With the storage providers we deploy all.Of this in the smart contract and then.We operate and the bridge is going to.Say okay this is the quality of services.Of the storage with the consumer speed I.Mean upload download speed latency stuff.Like this and according to the quality.They agreed to increase the reputation.Score of contract on earth as a.Providers as well and then it's where.You start to have a bit of tokconomics.And stuff like this.So it's what we we.Want to achieve with Stellar and.Normally we should have the first trench.One delivered within the next weeks.It's our next goal right now. That's super exciting and and I think.It's it's really interesting.It's an.Interesting use case for for for smart.Contracts., just before we went on.The call here, we were talking about.There's a lot of focus on on DeFi.Applications on on chain and and more.Like working with tokenization and real.World assets and but but this is a very.To me is a very untra untraditional. blockchain project. but but you.Have taken some of the some of the.Elements and applied that in in a.Project that or a product that you don't.Usually associate with with blockchain.And I think that's super interesting..Love to see more of that. it's.It's interesting to see these kind of.Use cases where you are thinking huh.That that was not obvious to use.Blockchain in that way but it works.Really well.So it broadens the the the.Scope of what you can do and how you.Perceive blockchain.So yeah, super.Interesting. Yeah, thank you.Indeed, it's I would say that for the.The ecosystem, if people are very.Curious about this kind of technology,.It's the deep technology finally.The central physical infrastructure.Network some people are indeed deploying.Their own blockchain and their own.Protocol stuff like this.For us, we.Prefer to use the existing existing.Blockchain and to build in fact with.Smart contract. which is great with.Stellar is in fact the flexibility.Mean we first in Rust which we have a.Preference in rest. sorry Goland.But yeah we have a preference in Rust. the Stellar kit kit is very nice and.And the thing is that with all the.Programs you're doing like with the.University is great because indeed you.Can you can discover the ecosystem.And to you can truly develop something.Real. Great.Yeah.I I don't know if.There's any questions from anyone.Watching but otherwise I say this.Was this is super great to see this.Demo. I remember talking to you.About this about a year ago and I.Thought this is an interesting use case.I would love to see that in real life.You launched the the.First version and yeah I I've been.Playing around with it and I think this.Is this is super interesting and.Everyone who plays around with it if.There's any if you find anything u I.Think I know that that you're very u.You're very appreciative of of feedback.It is the it is early days of the.So yeah, please forward any.Feedback you may have.I think we have a.Question here from from Matias..It also raises awareness from other.Nonblockchain orient corpse and orgs to.Start thinking of integrations to make.Things more efficient.Yeah, I think.This is a good example of that.Exactly.And I think we.Blockchain is AI cloud storage it's very.Demanding in term of I think that.That's put for the blockchain.So it's.Why it's maybe. comparative is not so developed.Because there are still a lot of things.To do around blockchain in term of.Scalability to make this kind of use.Case more and more applicable with the.Blockchain.Yeah, we see a lot of focus.On on AI not just on tooling but also.Like implementing. both blockchain and AI in the same.Application where it makes sense how are.You using AI.I know if I see on your.Website you do mention AI.So in what.Way are you using AI in your.Application?
Application?
Application?
 Yeah, so it's true that if people go. Yeah, so it's true that if people go.Through our website we don't do not.Mention so much about decentralized.Technologies and stuff like this. and.Indeed because it's like for us a kind.Of motor and people you know see the.Design of the car and not specifically.The motor inside but in our AI we are.Going to.I mean from the AI we're going to.Develop we have different steps of the.We're going to have the first step is.Could be a chatbased recommendation.System because basically most of the.Developers v coders even exper.People with expertise sometimes needs do.As well to to see how they can leverage.In the best way the platform.So we're.Going to guide people so chart to.Understand what they are looking for in.Term of multi cloud configuration.If they're looking for a micro.Configuration if they have some credits.Or we can help them to reduce the cost.And sometimes to take all the benefits.Of this wide ecosystem which is.Extremely fragmented today. and so.It's going to be the first version of AI.And indeed with the use AI needs data.And so AI can't do a lot if you don't.Have a lot of people using the platform.So it's why I'm pushing people to indeed.Try and use the platform because this AI.Is going to indeed learn more about your.Patterns and more learn about all you.You can do what you can do with the.Platform and then improve your.Recommendation in real time saying like.Oh yeah you are using this kind of.Storage, you're doing everything in odd.Storage with AWS.While in fact we can.See that 50% of your data are not used. in a frequent way.So you are just.Being a lot perhaps you can just be.Great part in StarJ or FON and reduce.The cost and so it's where the AI is.Going to intervene in your journey with.The platform and what we want to achieve.With AI for decentralization.It's you know decentralizing AI is.Always complex is more perhaps what.We are looking at right now is perhaps.On the privacy level perhaps on.Providing all the is doing certain.Recommendation stuff like this but.Right now the decentralized AI is still.Kind of a baby in in the crypto space.I I noticed something you said. you said that you're not really.Advertising.you don't really write that.You that that you use blockchain.,.And I think I think that's actually it.It's it's interesting because I see.Blockchain as a technology just like.Many other technologies.It's not.Necessarily.That that the users don't really it's.It's information that if if you have a.Really nice imple implementation that.Doesn't really have where users don't.Have to jump through a lot of hoops that.We usually see in a lot of blockchain.Applications.It's not really relevant.How you choose to solve the the problems.Is is not you use technology.In this.Case you use blockchain.I I love to.See it be more normalized that.Blockchain you don't need to you don't.Need to put it up as a big banner you're.Using blockchain like more normalized.Using blockchain in different kinds of.Applications so I think I think that's.That's interesting yeah we have a.Question more from Matias he asked what. you think about awe. a good question aweave is.Extremely nice in term of volat of.Course it's made for this I mean it has.Been designed for this I know that there.Is they're doing more and more kind of.Development on the top of the protocol.There right now to indeed diversify with.Other.Storage type like storage and or at.Least storage perhaps our wave is a.Bit expensive from my u point of view .Specifically if you want to store NFTs.So you know very small portion of data. the cost for a terabytes.Is very specific application at least.For the main the core protocol of code I.Know that they're working on different.Angle and trying to simplify or doing.What the cloud is doing finally. so I think the next evolution they're.Going to do can be good I think it's.They got the same issue.That Fon got in the past because Fon did.This protocol very interesting consensus.By the way.I mean it's very the math.Behind it is it's beautiful.I mean they.Did something very very nice zero.Knowledge applic.Too too slow and I don't know all.People know about that but you have to.When you store your data with fon you.Have to unlock a portion of gigabytes.You have to seal it and then in seal it.So this mechanism that prove that you're.Somebody hosting your data at the same.Time it's very slow to retrieve the data.So they have to work on a lot of systems.And you know to accept certain central.Centralized process to make it faster.But anyway it's it's part of the.Blockchain journey I believe that more.And more the blockchain is going to.Evolve the best it would be in term of u.Decentralization for storage and.Computing and more. great well thank you so much for joining.Today for me It's it's it's.It's it's it's been it's.Been fun to be a tiny part of this.Journey.I've followed you along the.Lines since we on the side since we.Met first time last year and see that.You you launched the product and .Yeah, it's great to see so everyone.Please go check it out and yeah,.Thank you again for for joining this.Week. Thank you very much guys. Thank you everyone for for joining.We'll be back again next week.
