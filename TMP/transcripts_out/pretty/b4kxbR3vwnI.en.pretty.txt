Perfect.Well, I'm Rubén Galindo,.Perfect.The CEO of El Tiempo or Sitio.I've been.In this job for seven years.It's been.A great adventure.We started.With the mission of giving.Financial freedom to the people of Latin America.Because we believe it's a.Human right to have.Access to financial services that.Let you do what you want to do.And.Many times,.As I said, "Are you listening?" "We're.Not listening, 65, friend.My computer is telling me it's.Changing the audio selection." But well, we think it's.Financial freedom, and because of that.Feeling of...Injustice!
We.Created this platform so that.Everyone can have access to money that.Is connected to the rest of the world,.No matter where they are or.The conditions in their countries.I love being here in a.Blogging discussion because I believe that.This financial freedom movement,.Or this fight, is a.Decentralized fight being waged on.Different fronts by different.Companies that make up different parts.Of the ecosystem.And I would love for.This call to result in more.Entrepreneurs willing to.Join the battle, taking on a role in.Any of.The verticals or.Supply chain steps, to give.Americans and people all over the.World financial freedom.Thanks to.Ruben, the mission is impressive.And well, we.Want to hear more.Now, let me.Introduce Jacques.Thank you for your.Invitation.Hello everyone, I'm Jack.Saracco, co-founder and leader of business.Development and partnerships in Seattle.We are the largest fiat ramp in.Latin America.We acquire.Users by letting them buy crypto.With local fiat in Argentina, Brazil,.And Mexico.And well, it seemed very logical.Rubén, we started in 2018 with the.Goal of helping the masses,.Everyone, to transition.From fiat to crypto in the.Easiest, fastest, and most scalable way possible.I think we're in a.Phase of greater infrastructure, where the.Art is richer, and we aim.To help decentralize.Institutions with.Centralized applications that want to start.Attracting users and giving them financial freedom.But we're always thinking about how to.Give Latin.Americans, who mostly.Suffer from inflation and excessive.Monetary power, the opportunity to.Give this power back to the people and.The user instead of letting.A few keep it.So that's what we do.At Zettel, and I think I share.Exactly the same view as Rubén.If we.Can get more entrepreneurs from this who.Want to create more applications.With more motivation, creating a.Bigger crypto industry, everyone.Wins.Thanks for the.Intro.We also want to hear more about.Voz and being a network.Now, hi.Milagros, can you tell us about.Voz and how close you are to Bay Brand and Mercedes.Sole?
And thank you for the invitation.My name is Milagros Chorro.I'm the.Content marketing lead for.Buy Brand by Frank T.It's a.Digital wallet that uses.Blockchain technology and allows you to buy, store,.Send, and receive.Our.Wallet is developed on external.Blockchain, which makes it possible for.Users to send and receive.Unlimited transactions for.Free.We're also part of the Steller.Development Foundation, the.Non-profit organization that oversees the.Steller network.To tell you a little about my.Personal story and how I got here, I have a degree.In international relations and have.Worked in marketing for a few years.A.Little over a year ago, I couldn't have known.This industry.I'm.Super happy to be here and to.Share this event with this incredible.Panel of speakers we have today.Thank you so much, Milagros.I want to clarify for.Those watching that Milagros and I.Work together, and it's amazing to have you.Here on this panel.And now, Matías,.Eager to hear about Voz and.Cronos Page.It's.A pleasure, and a pleasure to.Everyone else for being here.Thank you.I.'m a co-founder and I'm the head of Cronos,.But it's a startup that.Basically focuses on this fight.As.The guys were saying, the.Difference between big and.Small players in South America, with all the.Struggles of the big players and the high.Costs of transfers and collections, is significant.We basically apply all the.Technology of Block Change, particularly to the.Stellar platform, trying to optimize all.Those channels and bring.Cost optimization and.Transaction speed not only to individuals.But also to companies,.Entrepreneurs, and freelancers.We also focus very.Importantly not only on.Online payments but also on.In-person payments, which I can.Explain in a bit more detail later if you'd like.We.Want to hear from everyone.Impressive and super innovative.Well,.With this panel of 10, we want to spread the word about.The possibilities of Block.Change technology and continue to boost the ecosystem by.Democratizing access for.Users, developers, and.Entrepreneurs alike.We believe this panel should be.Interactive, so if you have any questions,.Please ask them through the chat.At the end of the talk, we'll.Try to answer some.Okay, let's begin.I want to start with.A pretty simple question: How.Did you discover Block Change, and what's your.Story in the ecosystem,.Rubén?
Let's see if you want to start over.Sure, with pleasure.I started in Blog Change in the...In 2015,.Maybe in 2014, someone invited me to.Breakfast in November.To talk about Bitcoin.Was at my best friend's house; he's getting.Married tomorrow, and I have to write some.Pitches for his wedding.There at that.Table, I had an offer to go and be.An.Intern at what were the first sexting-.Described programs that existed, and it was called...But.I didn't know if I wanted to go.We just wanted to go so much.Arrived in San Francisco on January 1st or 8th,.I think, of 2015, at this startup, and.Our task in this state as.Interns would be to sell it.We didn't know who we.Could sell the promise of the.Block to.They even had their own.Research Inc., which was a.Very unique abstraction of the blog for their coins, and they.Were doing it before everyone else.Tried to sell it to.Mobile phone companies,.Banks, remittance companies, but nobody wanted it.Then one of our co-founders.Said, "Look, here we have the.Technology that would help us give.Anyone access to free money.Who is.This free money thinking?" And we're going to.Understand...Why people were using Bitcoin from.Argentina to Venezuela, and obviously it's.Quite easy.Or simple.The reason is that people see.Value in this technology because.They lack financial freedom.So,.Working in the pulp industry, wanting to be an.Entrepreneur, and being from San Francisco, that's how.The idea came about to.Fight for those who.Lack freedom, leveraging.Both of us.I loved the story, and well, the.Best part is writing.To your chips for the.Wedding, not exactly, not exactly.If.You want, I can.Tell you a little bit about how.I started around 2016-2017,.Describing it for the first time, seeing.Where it was moving, how it interacted.I think as Argentinians, the vast majority.Got into it because of.Inflation, the peso, the potential to.Create a reserve that no one.Can touch and that they can erase from being the owner.Of it.In 2018, the question.Was how do we create something that has a lot of.Future value?
And our analysis was,.We see that today.99.99% of the world's money is on the.Institutional side, on the.Fiat side.How do we create something that.Directly helps people?
To.Get into Christ, we had a...Personally had a pretty.Difficult time, it was poorly written.I had to.Buy P2P from people and buy.A little bit of Bitcoin every now and then.The.Transactions were in cash because otherwise I was.Afraid that someone would take advantage of me.Somehow.We thought about how we could solve.That problem.Well, that's how we came up with the idea.Of ​​making a ramp.Look at.That moment, and then a bit.Inspired by the idea of ​​a ramp, look here.This.Product can be clicked on; it will.Be a product for.Sending and moving money.Internationally from one place to another.We had.Many clients who were asking us for it,.And at that moment, in early.2019, the question was, "Okay, which is the.Cheapest block, the one that allows you to send.Funds from one place to another?" We started looking at.Absolutely all of them, all those that.Were in the top 10, top 20 at that time.Of those,.5 remained, which are still there.Today.Stellar among them, we said, "Okay, let's start.Doing operations on Stellar.Because it's scalable, it's fast," and today,.From the mindset of an Argentinian with...The costs in Argentina didn't make sense;.Paying in mystery for an angle that cost.Between $4 and $8 was the GAFI (Global Action Fund).We said, ".Well, this is unscalable." It started in.Argentina, but it's already very expensive.What's cheaper than the Dominican Republic?
What's cheaper than the Dominican Republic?
What's cheaper than the Dominican Republic?
Well, Estelar was also a.Well, Estelar was also a.Name, not for us, and that's how we.Became Ramp Fiat Era Corp for.Everything related to fabric.We created the table.With the Argentine currency and the.Brazilian real.Very good story, good,.Very visionary too.Five years.Well, to share, my story is.Very different and very recent.Compared to Jackie and Rubén's.Their.Delivery to the world of Block Sing during the pandemic.In my case, before starting Block.Sing, I worked for other startups that.Had nothing to do with Chinese.Crypt blogs.And while it seemed like a.Very interesting industry in which I had.Worked previously, at that time I.Was close to finishing my studies.I wanted to start exploring other.Industries, growing a little more in.Marketing, and that's how I got to By.Brand.I got there for work and.Ended up falling in love with blogging.But, well, at the beginning, having no.Experience.In this, I had to immerse myself and.Learn from scratch.All the new.Concepts and knowledge that I didn't have...I knew a little about blogs without knowing.Much about crypto because of my previous job,.But well, my knowledge was super.Limited compared to what I know.Now.The truth is, as I was saying, I was lucky enough to.Work with a low-.Cost option like this one, and I think that played a.Super favorable role in allowing me to.Experiment a bit on a personal level.With crypto.And also, Bailantas, let's say.Months before I started.Working, saw the opportunity to give.Argentinians this alternative means.To protect themselves from devaluation, and what I.Liked most about the app is that it's.Designed to expand access to.Students like me.Yes, it has a.Great mission, which is to democratize crypto,.Making it super easy, allowing.All Argentinians to.Access a secure wallet in their profile.So, that's a bit of the.Story of how I discovered...well,.Thanks to Milagro, and well, I hope that.All the recent graduates.Watching us are inspired and encouraged to.Join the ecosystem.So, yes, that's.It.So, my journey.Also started as...Being.Argentinian, I was looking for ways to.Maintain the value of the currency around 2015,.Which I became very involved in.After that, I was heavily involved.In the development side, trying to.Provide solutions for.Document certification based on origin.Delved deeply into blogs to.Understand how to assign value to a.Digitally transmitted document and.Verify its authenticity.This was.The first multinational company I'd worked for in a.Long time,.And it was a success.What we.Did was.Certify educational documents.Brought this project to the US, and there,.We basically added.A QR code to the university document.This QR code was used to certify that it truly.Came from the issuing entity and verify that the.Person was presenting it for work,.For example, their academic record.So, I.Started strong with the blockchain aspect,.Especially the certification side.After this, understanding the.South American landscape and seeing that there was a.Payment processing technology that had.N't been updated in 20 years,.We're now 100% focused on trying to.Modernize it.Those payment processing.With BlockChange and basically with the. Stellar solution, so that's how we are.Thank you, Matías.I love seeing the.Different paths you took, and well, the.Use case you just described in.Terms of how you enter, which demonstrates.The different.Capabilities of what you can do in.BlogChange and not.So, well, great.Okay,.Another question.I'd love to know more.About how Piti Sanz BlogChange operates in.His companies and what he believes are.The main benefits of BlogChange.For his clients.Let's start with, since.This time it works perfectly.We are native to BlogChange.You understand that we created the.Company to be able to provide solutions for.Written companies and BlogChange companies.In particular.One of the services we offer,.As I mentioned, is that we accept fiat.In Argentina, Basic, and Mexico, and we provide.Scripting services.You can make purchases,.Not only of decentralized applications.To wallets and ecosystems, but also.To.Institutional clients.We have many companies.That do corporate banking, whether on one.Side or the other.From that,.We are very interested in working.We realized.That there was a very.High cost in remittance transactions,.Both for.Retail people who have access to.US money, for example, to.Latin America, or for companies.Wanting to pay their Argentine or.Latin American subsidiaries.We saw that there was a.Very high cost, so the opportunity to.Use a block change was incredible.Because having a double option—low.Cost and fast execution—made us.Very scalable.This was especially true for the.Counterparty, which would be the.Institutional banking services that have been.Developing for the last 50 years.Logically, in 2018 and 2019, it was.Very difficult for us to get.People from these companies, like.Txemi, to understand how they could use these transactions to their advantage.When they.Really started to see that they were saving a.Lot of money, especially in their.Stocks, and began to see the genuine use case.In their day-to-day operations and in their own pockets, it became even more challenging.But when they started wanting to repeat.The operations with higher volumes and.Began to tell people, saying, ".This works, and it's real," I think it's very.Important to highlight that in 2018 and.2019, many They believed that writings, and.Before that, not much.Crypto production remained, as something illegal, something.From the black market that you shouldn't get involved in.Today, I think 2022 changed.The perspective a lot.Today it seems like.Entrepreneurship, innovation, and the future.With a lot more agility and transparency,.When just a few years ago it wasn't like that.I think that we're going to start.Seeing more and more companies.Moving in this direction.Incredible that many more people from the.Institutional sector are starting to give it the option of.Registering as a medium to.Interact financially in the future.Great!
Thanks for the details.I love.Thanks for the details.Hearing about companies that.Develop the infrastructure and.Ramps in Latin America that continue.Working on access to blogs and.Getting more people, let's say more.End users, to join.I think it's super.Important.I think we're.Like a.Bridge that takes people from.Fiat to crypto, and the objective of.Applications, like you'll see, like.The Mokro footer, I don't know, is also to.Maintain users and.Give them a service within the cryptocurrencies,.While we are the bridge that.Interacts from one side to the other.Great!
I'd.Like to add, I think He's absolutely right,.Given that we're on a panel with other.Entrepreneurs.I think it's important for.Everyone to see how the Chinese blog.Is not just technology that.Allows—I'm saying specifically.Applied to payments—but it allows for.Much smoother and cheaper payments, this.Exchange of information and money.Also.Technology that democratizes access.For entrepreneurs to participate in a.Business that was previously.Extremely exclusive and.Only available to banks and.Financial institutions that.Needed a huge investment to.Participate.In a way, we, as.Industry leaders, are intermediating.These players, the dinosaurs, and it.'s now completely open; anyone can.So, it makes me not.Only a disruptive technology but.Also, I think,.A great tool for starting.Businesses and generating value with or without a.Few barriers to entry.I absolutely love it.I totally agree.Great to communicate this to.Entrepreneurs so they know it's.Possible and are encouraged to join.The ecosystem.And so, obviously, everyone.On this panel, as industry leaders,.I think it's crucial that they join.These talks and tell us a bit about.Their story, what they're doing today, and.The problems they're solving.So that we can evolve.Ecosystem together.And to talk a little about this, well.In our case with Buy Brand, as.I mentioned before, Fiverr gave.Argentinians the opportunity and access.To a means to safeguard.The value of their assets, and well, as an app.Developed in Estelar Vaivén, it was.Specifically designed to extend.This access to coins pegged to the.Price of the dollar, like me, yes, yes,.And I think that with respect to the.General benefits of this technology, I.Think the most important benefit we.Could highlight.For us is decentralization.I think it's a.Key characteristic of the technology, and it's.Its strength, since to.Authenticate transactions or operations, you.Don't need any kind of.Intermediary, and this obviously allows for.Reduced validation times.On the.Other hand, we have the fact of.Network distribution.When you.Have a distributed network, in the first.Instance, nobody owns that network, and I.Think that means users don't always.Have a record of the.Information.And also, as.The guys mentioned before, the.Technology has very, very low costs.For users, which I think is.The star advantage of blockchain,.And well, in our case, in the case In the case of.Buy Brand, transactions in the.Systems described are also carried out by.Individuals without any.Involvement from a central control body.What does this mean again?
What does this mean again?
What does this mean again?
Without any intermediary.Without any intermediary.This allows for a reduction in costs, let's.Say.Network maintenance makes it.Significantly.Cheaper, right?
And lastly, I think.We could also highlight, as.The guys mentioned earlier, the speed.Crypto transactions are super.Fast to process, I'd say.Practically instantaneous, and I think this.Is also a great solution that.Blogs Reynolds has the power to streamline these.Slow banking transaction processes.Great,.Thanks Milagros for telling us.More about By Brand.And now,.Matías, regarding Canon, in the case of Cronos.Pay, I.Know of a Cross case.Basically,.We were born 100% in Blogs.It was.Also the decision about who.Would fight to run a bit of what.We talked about: cost, speed of.Distribution, and we all chose Estelar.For that reason.But we were born in Block.Change, always thinking that.Technology.Will help, as it is helping, to.Change the payment processing system.Going into a bit more detail,.When an account is generated within.Cronos Space, an account is automatically created with.Estelar,.And from there, depending on the country,.A bank account is generated for that.Country.It requires, and there we use.The other stilts of the ecosystem to.Do the Rambo, a ramp-off, as.Jack said, of this vile coin and the connection.To fiat in each of the countries, and we also.Use the.Crypto stilts to sometimes get out, water,.Yum, str, sub-20, depending, let's say, on.The alternatives that are required, and.Adding a little to what.Rubén was saying, the reason why, let's say, for me, the.Importance of all these changes, or of.People from outside the traditional financial system.Getting involved, I want to be.Electronic, I have a.Master's degree in.Finance, but my education wasn't, let's say, in.The financial part, but rather we.Were a little more than anything from.The experience and the problems we.Have in emerging countries, and a.Little studying how all this was composed,.You see that the banks.Initially.Worked with these systems, and that there are.Several and they are unique, and that they always took.Turns so that it remained within.Their very closed ecosystem in the.Financial part, until at a certain point a.Very select group, let's say, generated.A very elite club where they went to eat.Caviar and in a very particular way, and that's where.The first credit card was generated.Created in the club, which was the one for.Dinners, and they say it was.Used, let's say, for those types of.Transactions.That's when.Banks started generating their own.Credit cards, and the.Banks themselves own the.Credit cards.So it's still the same.Ecosystem.And today, where are we.Going with Cronos Page?
That is, there's.A possibility that Blanchett technology gives us.To try to avoid all those.High commissions charged for.Centralized transfers.We can.Use a different method so that.Anyone who might have a.Business in Peru, Ecuador,.Charco, or any province.In South America or an.Emerging country can collect payments with their phone,.With no costs, and the money goes.To intermediaries instead of people.Great, it's a new paradigm.Well, I love hearing that all these.Companies are like blogs on Late Night, I don't know, that they.Started directly in.Blogs.So.I think it's super innovative, especially since they're.Trying to optimize a system,.Not completely change it.I think it's great.And now I see an interesting question in the.Chat: they ask how they see.The developer market in.Stellar, particularly.Other other.Blocks in Snow, as Jon.Solana says, and which are concentrating talent,.See that they can be a chalet for.Climbing or developing new ideas.I think that as entrepreneurs we can't.Be married to a.Particular technology because what we want is to.Solve.People's problems, and people have.Problems that may need.Different technologies.From our.Perspective, we see that by.Dedicating ourselves to giving.People crypto dollar accounts, and with so many.Different.Versions of crypto on different.Platforms or in different options,.We have to be.As versatile as possible to fulfill our mission, and we.Have to be compatible with.Any technology because what.Matters is not what technology you use, what.Matters is your ability to solve.People's problems.What I like about.Tela, compared to the others, is that.Tela is very focused.On creating decentralized rails.For money, to connect the.World's money.And then all the investment.That the Stellar team makes, which is.Truly a super team, and obviously.Today I'm going to.Say that because Stellar.Investors of time and of.Ours, but I've.Worked with them for a long time,.We've worked with them for a long time, and I.Can seriously attest to that.The quality.Of the team and you.Can also see the amount of investment they.Make in developing the ecosystem, not.Only by.Bringing in participants like Artem or.Acero, or by creating their own.Tools like Bailén to understand.How their technology should be used.From the entrepreneurs' point of view.They.Also do.Versions with giant companies like.MoneyGram, and they are also working on.Sets with Justice and.Exchange, and also with Stand,.Working closely with regulators.They have a 100% focus on the financial sector,.And the others have more of a.Website focus.We are going to create the.Decentralized world, and so.Imagine that huge task.From.The decentralized world, a.Very big part is getting money in and out of the.Decentralized world, but the truth is.That they are trying to build everything.From scratch, and I think that, as an.Entrepreneur, gives me a lot of.Anxiety to think that I have to do.Everything because you can't do everything.So, around me,.The star postcard is well focused.Because I believe in the approach.Totally agree with.The question.Very interesting.You respect it.I think I share what.I had thought, directly,.Which is to learn specifically.It was each blog.Who wants to solve Some.Particular vertical of the Web 3 world, for.Example, in JR, they want to somehow.Solve the gaming benefits part.You.Also have within.Solana's writing the Solana part, and look at what they do in.Spirits, Solana, which is like.Defy, cheaper within what the.Competition,.I think everyone wants to take on a role in.The different, infinite verticals.Of Web 3.Without going any further, in Action Clean, he indicated.That it wasn't useful for him to.Do.Gaming, so he went out to do his.Own Blues in Running as an example.It ca.N't be absolutely everything; it's.A great base for many things,.But they're going to visit different.Verticals to execute other things.Think that, as Rubens Telar said,.The main focus is finance and.Payments.If they execute that well, they can.Grow a lot with the team that.Has the highest probability of executing it.It's more focused than other blogs because.We have to show the use case.Well, in.Tracing, even the burning lives, it's that the.Huge, it's true, and Pierre.Transactions, Juan, with how many.Temptations with transactions can be.Made, by what means, how fast, at.What cost, they aim to streamline a.Very particular niche Web 3 is.Where I see the.Biggest disruption coming,.Which is in finance—logically,.Decentralized, fast, and inclusive.Great!
Decentralized, fast, and inclusive.Great!
We're touching on a lot of topics, including.We're touching on a lot of topics, including.Interoperability, so a.Discussion can emerge about Web 3 and Blockchain.We're all working on.How to make it much more.Interoperable.This is just the.Beginning; the boxing world is like.A baby, we're only in its.Early years, and we're all.Working to make.All the systems more interoperable.And your companies are also.Focusing on all these super.Interesting topics.And the questions you ask us...One more question about the.Ecosystem, and specifically about the roya (roya).We're discussing: how do you work?
We're discussing: how do you work?
We're discussing: how do you work?
How do you see the.How do you see the.Stellar ecosystem, and do you work together, or how do you.Collaborate within the ecosystem, not.Only Stellar but also in.The Blockchain ecosystem in general?
Within that ecosystem, as I mentioned,.Within that ecosystem, as I mentioned,.We have a pillar that.Connects fiat to crypto.We work with many.Companies because, ultimately,.We are the.Infrastructure provider for the others.Decentralized centralized applications can shine and attract.Users in the region.Work with most of the.Panelists.We work well with Artem,.With Buy Brand, LED production, and.Fiat ramp in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.All goes well, we're also close to reserving.The Cronos service.But we work both in the.Stellar ecosystem and in other.Ecosystems like Incidío and the one.From 20 years ago, providing.Liquidity and payment gateway service.For those users who want to.Start using crypto within.Any of the applications.Within that, within what.Is Fiat Honor, we also have,.As I mentioned, in our table coins,.Arte and Barrilete, which would be the.Argentine peso and the.Brazilian Técnico, respectively.They are entirely in English to be.Used by anyone who wants to be in the ecosystem.Within the member sets,.Which is the Stellar integration.Anyone who wants to be can.Use it, and it can be a means of payment.For any application that.Wants to copy within this ecosystem.Yes, well, as Argentina,.Obviously, it's a source of pride to have the RCT, which for.Those who are listening, what is the.Table comment about the Argentine peso?
Table comment about the Argentine peso?
Table comment about the Argentine peso?
Well, I always say that number, I.Well, I always say that number, I.Mean, a very big step in being.One of the first to issue the.Argentine peso currency, and well, to be able to.Start spreading it in the ecosystem.I'm a fan of RCT.For you,.And well, Milagros, I mean, they.Work with ADR for seven.Hours.Since we're on this topic,.Tell us a little about the function.Of RST in the balance sheet.Great.Well, in our case, also.Answering the question of.How we work together with Stella, we.Work hand in hand to.Try to.Solve, or perhaps resolve, a.Very specific and important problem in Argentina,.Which is the memory of values.You're.Probably watching us from.Different Latin American countries, but.As most of you know,.Argentina unfortunately has an.Unstable economy.This brings with it.Certain.Consequences, one of the most noticeable being.The fragility of the currency, which,.Unfortunately, we've already gotten used to.But faced with that,.Argentinians tend to look for different.Alternatives to be able to protect the.Value of our money here in In Argentina,.One of the most used resources is.Buying dollars, but with the obstacles we.Have, and also the risks.Of potentially buying on a.Parallel market, Argentinians started.Looking for other.Alternatives.So, thanks to the.Progress of blogs and after working.With this one, I'll share a super.Interesting option today: buying.Crypto.This not only allows us to.Safeguard value, which I think is.Again our number one problem,.But also gives us access to.This 100% digital economy.It also allows us to work.Alongside, for example, to.Have new.Services.And going back to the.Topic of the recipe, there is an.Asset, a coin pegged to the value of the.Argentine peso.Through.Deposits, Argentinians.Can exchange these coins within the app.There's Oasis and Literary, so if you're in the.By Brand wallet, great!

The recipe allows you to access the.The recipe allows you to access the.Dollar-denominated assets, acting as a bridge between.Fiat currency and dollar-denominated assets, which is what.People want access to.So, great, I love.That.If you want to make a comment It's going to.Be because of the ecosystem issue.They were.Talking about the positive thing I see.Within these environments.What unites us, across other.Ecosystems, is that we're working on.Something particular:.Working towards a.Solution that impacts everyone's daily life.So, from that.Perspective, I think a.Very particular camaraderie is generated among us.All.I know people within the.Ecosystem who were even involved in other.Projects, who are now also focused on.Expanding, and who always.Want to do.Something to improve the situation for their country or nationality.Always address issues like remittances,.Maintaining the value of their.Local currency, and helping their families.In other countries.So, I think that those who are part of this.Blog have a situation that.We all share in.Emerging countries.That's why this camaraderie is generated,.To try to help.Each other, not just with the kids,.Particularly in the area of ​​development.I also agree that the selection of.Blogs, which will be seen later, will involve a.Purging of everything that's out there, and because of the dot-coms of the.World.The moment everything started,.Those that have a.Very specific focus on a particular market, a.Vertical, and those are the best, will obviously remain.Basically, we're going to install them.Because the objective is very clear, and it's not, let's.Say, a.Multi-sector solution with many.Options for everyone, but rather the.Optimization of financial matters, part.Of remittances and other services.And I think that's.Where the.Focus will grow significantly for the.Solutions we want.Our goal.Seems very.Aligned, as will the objectives.Of not just creating.A star company like Cronos,.Which has a specific goal.Well, I love hearing in.The industry blogs how everyone works.Together.I think it's something remarkable.Because, more than anything, that's what.Entrepreneurs are all about.We all know that the.Entrepreneurial path is sometimes very.Lonely and very difficult, so.Having this camaraderie, this.Help, and this support at the end of the day.Seems incredibly important to me.I think that's something that.Stands out in the crypto world, although.We are very much involved with each other.I think.All the calls we're making, if we're.Talking about a panel, always come up when.All the panelists finish.They are.Really open to being.Contacted, always through Twitter,.Always through email, Telegram.Any.Questions, let us know if we have a call, if.We can refer you.I think it was.The beginning where those of us.Involved in the crypto world wanted to.Help people get involved and.Educate themselves because the risk of a lack.Of education is very high.So I think you.See a lot of companies.Working together to generate something.Bigger, and.Crypto entrepreneurs wanting to help and educate.People who aren't involved in the.Subject today, to guide them to where they need to.Go, how, and what the fastest way is.For us to get.Involved in many.Startup proposals that want to start creating the.Stellar world.They don't know anything about the sets, they don't.Know how to integrate, they don't know what.An author is, and the truth is that we invest a.Lot of time in receiving those calls,.Accepting them, and really explaining.Where and what to do because they also have to go through.The mindset.You have to go through it, and the moment they.Reach the size and.Level of my code that is acquired to.Use any of these.Products or any service, we can't.Collaborating, getting back in.Touch with us, is great, and there are many we.'ve really helped to.Understand what it was like to understand.What the next steps would be and how it would.Help them or not,.For what they wanted to create.I think that's one of the.Most important qualities of the.Written world, and that's how it's believed to have grown, in that.Decentralization of helping each other between two.Aggressors.That's what I.Want to highlight again,.That aspect of the industry and.Also of the Steller ecosystem, not in.Having the power to call you, "You're.Here," and not ask you those questions, and.Having that guidance that can save you,.Not only a lot of time,.But also how to have that.Confidence in how to start and how to get.Into the ecosystem and how to succeed.I always wanted to put the.Point of this place, which was to ask.A question that I would love for him to be.Telling you about: what would.The steps be?
He's already experienced the.Future of integration.Tell me, what does it look like, what does it seem like,.And where is the.Path I have to follow to help.People not get confused?
I think it's about.Saving time for the whole.As I've grown, it's happened to me.Quite often,.And well, continuing with the topic of what.You consider necessary to develop the.Integration of Jane blogs in a startup.Or a new company, I'd love to.Hear a bit from Rubén about what.Advice you would give to someone who is.Starting out.Well, I.Same way.,.Or rather aligned with the.Decentralized technology method, I think that.Just as all entrepreneurs are.Quite open,.Maybe they don't answer Lides because they're.Busy, but surely they would all be.Willing to help.Also,.All the information one needs.To be able to.Frame this technology and adopt it.Is everywhere on the internet; it's.Open to all its teachers.That thing I was saying.About Ron and the taxi fort, to be able to.Have a version that was made to.Measure, adjusts to the needs, and speaks to.How accessible it is.They can take,.Copy, and paste their clone from the.Outside or make the changes they.Needed so that these actions.Required more adjustment to their way.You can leave it; there's a vulnerability, and they.Lost a lot.Tajín mirror.At the same time, I think it speaks to how.Accessible it is for anyone, and so.Now, yes,.And responsibility from the entrepreneur.Must be.Looking on the internet for.The most reliable sources, and I think that,.Compared to other.Technologies, they've made working with.Their keyboard super easy.Everything they.Put in the Web 2.0 language is almost entirely user-.Friendly, so that.A developer who has.Already worked in the business.World can understand how to apply the.There are tons of resources, and.Everything they develop to help.All companies is here; everything belongs to.Everyone.So it's a great way, I think,.To start.You can say, "How is it that they.Give you a whole framework so.You can easily develop.Your application?" And I'm.Simplifying, you know my identity, I'm a bit of a.Fool, but I see that our team—and I.Never.Say, obviously not all professions.Have their own language, like this, very.Solid and all that—but nobody has done.Anything like that.However, in a.Very familiar way,.The documentation and.Infrastructure are made so that.Back-end developers can.Interact with, use, and test the.Technology from home.So...Different resources.On this side, that's a really good point, a very good.Point for developers.The first question is always, "Do I need to.Know your Olivetti to develop?" And.Well, in that case, you have it.It's effective.In several languages, so that makes it.Easier for someone who is a.Developer and an expert in another.Language to focus and.Start easily.So, that's a great.Point.And if we talk about.Blogs in the UI, and I could talk for hours about.Blogs, without a doubt,.The people listening are.Also interested in knowing a little more.About you.So I wanted to see if you.Have any stories or anecdotes.About being an entrepreneur or about.The ecosystem that you want to share with.Those listening.In recent years,.Anecdote is like a summer, and how.The market seems, how it looked.Four years ago, and how it will look in the.Next four years.In entrepreneurship,.Four years ago we were crazy, all.The banks we called would hang up on us.Everyone thought we worked with.Drug traffickers, and everyone was.Afraid.And really, when we.Do everything possible to be in the The.Most compliant option possible.Today is the complete opposite.We have.Banks calling us to see.How crypto can be used and how they.Can innovate on the foundation of Christ.I think that in the next four years, we'll.See that all banks will.Incorporate crypto in one way or another, and it will.Become the norm.From four years ago, we'll.Look like crazy people, and we don't believe that.If you feel like you.'re creating something, maybe you can get on.The right track.Four years later, you'll be a hero.Because you're trying to create a product that.Today is perhaps very innovative for what's.Coming in the future.Yes, great, Matías.Any stories to share?
Well, it's a.Comment I got from an.Acquaintance.More of a coffee chat when I started to apply, let's.Say, a bit of what I think applies to.Everyone who at some point started.With a Chinese blog.When you see.All the things you can do—.Document certification, the.Applications that finance can have, the whole.Broad range of applications that.The financial sector has—.Well, a lot of technologies to.Apply, and I went with all that.Momentum.Junior entrepreneurs, and without.My milk, have ideas about all this,.And he looked at me and said, "Look, the.Reality is that even.As a vice president, he doesn't say exactly what you shouldn't.He tells me, 'You have to.Try to find a.Solution,.Focus, and give 100% to that.Solution.' One is the easiest decision.Because with the energy and.Desire you bring, you say, 'With blocks,.We're going to do a lot of things,' and you have a.Lot of serious things as an.Entrepreneur who starts with.This, but if I can add this, I.Can have a bigger solution.For.Me, the advice is to focus, give all your.Contacts, all your energy, and.100% to one solution.And not try to be all-powerful and have the right to.Do everything.Otherwise, you'll.Define who can't do anything, and only.Define a couple of things to.Do, not everything that can be.Solved.Great!
Focus is super.Milagros, any anecdotes you want to tell us?
Milagros, any anecdotes you want to tell us?
Well, I'll tell you a few.Cheers, Doctor.Well, it.Well, I'll tell you a few.Happened to me that when I started.Trip to Blue Change to work in the.Ecosystem, when I had to..." When I tried to explain to.A friend or family member what I was.Doing, they didn't seem to understand.I tried to explain what Jim's blog was, what.By Brandt did, and it was super.Difficult for everyone to understand.But little by little, with a.Lot of patience, I started showing each.Of my family members, uncles, and even my.Grandfather how to buy By.Brandt bikes.It's super easy, and now, a year.Later, I can't believe it.He.Came and told me he'd bought one.I decided to do a casting call on eBay,.26 Callao, I don't know, which is great.My uncle came and told me he'd already.Bought one.Yes, yes, the truth is, I'm really.Proud that in a.Year I've been able to convince so.Many family members and so many other people to join.The ecosystem, and I think that's.Super important.It's an.Anecdote I always like to share:.In a year you can do so many things, and.Including so many people in the.Ecosystem seems really.Interesting to me.And with this story, I'll see.How, in a way,.Working on blogs and also all the.People around you—not your.Family, your friends, but in a certain way—it's about...The way.They start to get involved and find out, and well,.That seems super important to us,.Rubén.Any stories of yours?
Well, I'm.Going to offer some advice.In the history of art there have been.Many.Horror stories.Caused by war.Venturing into this adventure with this.New technology has made life.Difficult in a way because we.Started as pioneers, knowing what it was going to.Do to us, but at the.Same time clashing with a world that already had.Fibers that were elsewhere.But that made it difficult for us at the.Beginning to get up and running.Convincing people to work with.Us was difficult.We were.Starting to evangelize everyone, and on top of that, we were.Trying to set up a.Parish that charged fees, so it was.Difficult.However, what always.Helped us was keeping in mind that what.We wanted was to help.People, and we have such a clear vision that it.Allowed us to keep going.When things went badly, and me too.Although things aren't easy, I.Realize that what differentiates a.Good entrepreneur from what happens is that.One stays with the.Energy to keep going, and.Another suddenly gets tired of.Doing it.A vision worthy of time, and.Time itself, gives you the.Energy to keep giving it your all, the.Time you have to give it.So that your.Company, your self-employment, is excellent and successful.So that's what I'm going to.Tell everyone with this advice:.Choose your missions well, and if you.Have a vision.That drives you, then that's all you.Need because the rest—.Persistence—is there, but a worthy mission.That makes you persistent...I don't know.How it works.Sometimes.So, this advice...and well, back to the.Focus,.In terms of.Financial inclusion.Financial inclusion,.Yes, of course, that's a distributed mission.That aligns us all, and we all.Benefit from it.So, they also have.A very powerful mission in.The world, boxing, which is really cool.I see I'm echoing and I apologize, I don't know.Why,.But I wanted to close by talking to.Everyone and answering a question I.Saw in the chat, which is how we can be.More involved with the ecosystem.And well,.Estelar is doing an event in.Mexico, not only in Mexico but also.Virtually in May, which...The event that everyone.Can join is from May 20th to 22nd and it's.Called Startup Weekend or Blogs.In Mexico City.It's super long, but anyway,.I'm going to put the link to the chat channel so you can.See it and, well, so that,.According to the system, you'll be encouraged to participate.Want to tell everyone that there's no.Question that isn't.Valid, so please contact us.I want to.Thank this panel; it's an honor to.Be here with you.And again,.The companies you've built are the ones.We look at every day, and.We're always waiting to see them.Grow more and more day by day.We hope to.Hear much more from you and your.Companies.Thank you so much for the invitation,.Brad Animals.I had an amazing time, and I.Hope that those who listened on the.Other side took away some insights.Again, I'm.Personally totally open to.Helping you with whatever you need on this.Path, the entrepreneurial path, the path.Of wanting to create, grow, and build something.Yes,.Well, you can contact me through the.Set's website, my Twitter is.@jacquessaracco, any.Messages are always welcome.Likewise, thank you very much for everything.You can't.Find me.As Rubén, who is a Twitter user, I.Ask that you visit me if you need.Me because I was a bit rude when answering,.But anyway, I don't want to start an argument.Thank you, Mercedes, and everyone for.Participating in this role.It was very helpful.I wish you a great weekend.See you soon.Well, thank you all.Invite you to follow us on.Social media and download By Brandy.And try it out.There are many new things coming.To the app, so I.Invite you to download it.It's available.On iOS and Android.And also, I'm at your.Disposal if you need anything or.Have any questions regarding this.Case or Ireland.On my end, thank you to the.Panel.It's really great, everything you're.Building is excellent.I'm very happy to be.Here with you.Greetings also to all the.Entrepreneurs and everyone who wants to get.Involved on this side or in any.Blogging topic.I'm totally willing.So, thank you very much, Mercedes, and to the.Team.Thank you all very much, and.See you at the next Stellar event.Thank you very much.
