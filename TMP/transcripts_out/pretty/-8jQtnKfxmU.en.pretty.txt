Hello everyone and welcome to today's.Ecosystem panel on.Fintech in africa I'm justin a vp of.Ecosystem here at the Stellar.Development foundation and today I'm.Joined by four esteemed colleagues.Weeza from chippercache joseph from dfs.Lab.Rick from ClickPesa and tori from leaf.Global.Who are all here to discuss the fintech.Landscape in africa so they're going to.Talk about.The challenges and the opportunities.They see on the continent and in the.World in general.They're going to tell us about their.Companies and their personal journey.Journeys.And hopefully they'll even share some.Advice for budding entrepreneurs. so it's gonna be a fairly.Freewheeling discussion but we will do.Our best to incorporate audience.Questions when possible.So you'll see that there's a q a button.On your screen feel free to use it at.Any time to submit a question.Before we kick off the discussion though.We will take a few minutes to allow each.Panelist to introduce themselves and to.Give a little context about who they are.And what they're up to and i'll start as.I mentioned I'm justin from the Stellar.Development foundation.Which is a non-profit organization that.Seeks to support the growth and.Development of the Stellar network.In order to increase equitable access to.The world's financial infrastructure.So at SDF we believe Stellar has the.Potential to have a significant impact.In the world and we've also seen a ton.Of interest in Stellar in africa which.Is.Part of why we're hosting this ecosystem.Panel our goal here is to explore the.Experiences of aspiring companies that.Are delivering digital financial.Services across the continent.But also we're seeking to encourage.Those companies so in addition to this.Panel we're also launching the Stellar.Blockchain bootcamp with dfs lab in.September.We'll talk more about that at the end of.The hour so stay tuned. now i've mentioned Stellar a few.Times now. to make sure everyone knows what I'm.Talking about I'm going to use the rest.Of my intro time to give a quick.Overview what is Stellar.At a high level Stellar is a.Decentralized open network that connects.It is a global public blockchain built.For interoperability.And to further financial access and.Inclusion and it does that by making.Money more fluid.Thanks to its speed and scale and.Ability to represent and transfer value.It also makes markets more open because.When financial infrastructure is.Connected.You have greater geographical and.Affordable access to markets.And ultimately it empowers people.Because it gives them real ownership.Of the value in their possession so.Stellar is a platform that allows.Businesses and developers all over the.World to build solutions to real world.Problems.And many of the businesses represented.On this panel do just that.They build on Stellar so enough about.Stellar I will.Move on and let each of our panelists.Introduce themselves.Starting with wiza from chipper cache.Over to you. thank you justin hey everyone my name.Is wiesa talakasi. I am a malawian living between.Nairobi and johannesburg I am the vice.President of global developer relations.At super cache. triple cash is a mobile wallet. the largest smartphone only mobile.Money service.Operating on the continent with coverage.Across.Eight different african geographies as.Well as the uk and the united states.And we enable about 4 million users.All of our jurisdictions to send each.Other almost a billion dollars.Each and every year we've got basic.Peer-repair.Functionality both local and.International depending on the.Jurisdiction that you're in. we also enable users to get.Virtual and physical. prepaid debit cards that they can.Have tied to their chipper wallet. as well as purchasing some crypto.Assets namely bitcoin.Ethereum usdc a few more in the.Pipeline. as we make our crypto trading.Platform a bit more robust. fractional investing in u.s stocks .Air time and data bundles across the.Board as well as various kinds of bill.Payments for their respective.Jurisdictions.We're a young company three years old.But we've managed to grow pretty quickly.Over the last.Year year and a half right now at 160.People.We're building on stella's solutions to.Explore.The viability of cross-border settlement.With african.Stable coins a lot of the cross-border.Trade that takes place in africa is.Intermediated.Somewhat unnecessarily by the u.s dollar.And we think that we can take advantage.Of these.Stable coins to facilitate inter africa.Trade in a much more efficient and cost.Effective way.Fantastic thank you next up we have.Joseph from dfs.Lab joseph yeah hi.Thanks justin hi everyone .I'm joseph head of entrepreneur support.At dfs lab.Dfs lab is an early stage investor in.Companies for custom digital commerce we.Typically invest in pre-seed and seed.Stage.You know anywhere from twenty five.Thousand dollars to fifty thousand.Dollars. and we work with founders to help.Them understand their markets. help them grow their users and also.Help them you know raise bigger.Rounds in the future over the last five.Years.We've invested in companies like ochova.Pula suppliers one pipe and a bunch of.Other you know companies. we also run software and capital.Which is.At least like basically an angel club .That allows seasoned and new investors.To invest.You know anywhere from 2500 upwards.In companies were also invested in so.Yeah.Thank you great next up is rick from.Click pacer rick thank you. justin hi everyone.My name is rick I'm the co-founder and.Director of.Click passer ClickPesa has a company.Operating in east africa.Since 2018 we provide a toolbox of.Digital tools such as invoicing.Crm and e-commerce solutions.Combined with payments to smes and.Freelancers in east africa.Clepasa is active in the market kenya.Tanzania and rwanda helping local.Businesses perform better.To increase productivity and.Profitability.Our mission is to simplify doing.Business for companies.In or within east africa we've been.Building.On Stellar since 2018 whereby last year.We became an.Anchor on the Stellar network clickbait.Is a small company.Company around 10 people whereby most of.Us.Are operating from tanzania and.Excited to talk further about Stellar.In this panel looking forward for this.Our.Thank you fantastic thank you and.Finally from leaf global we have tori.Tori take it away.Thanks justin hi everyone really excited.To be joining the Stellar community.Again today you all have been.Such a source of support over the years.So happy to be with you.My name is tori samples and I'm the.Co-founder and cto of leaf global.Fintech.I am based in kigali rwanda and leaf.Currently operates in.Rwanda uganda and kenya with goals to.Expand across the continent.And into other markets eventually such.As latin america and the middle east and.Europe as well.We are a digital wallet that allows.People to safely store and transport.Their money across borders.Different than other digital wallets.Though we we really operate down market.We started with refugees and have.Expanded into cross-border traders.And informal merchants people that don't.Have access to the formal financial.System.They don't have bank accounts they.Probably have a mobile money account if.They're in east africa.But that's fairly limited in that it's.Very expensive and difficult to cross.Networks and to cross borders.And so leaf allows them to store their.Money over time in different currencies.To send and receive peer-to-peer with.Friends and family and other countries.For free.And they can cash in and cash out from.Any mobile money number and the.Countries in which we operate.We've also started adding in things like.Airtime purchase.And value-add services into the wallet.And the best part is that it's.Accessible over basic phones so you.Don't even need a smartphone to use leaf.We use a technology called ussd that.Brings the powerful Stellar based.Backend you know all built on blockchain.Into this really low-tech environment.Where people.Don't need to know that there's a.Blockchain behind the scenes they don't.Need to understand crypto to use our.Stablecoins.And they don't need to have a smartphone.Or data connection.Internet connection in order to use our.Services.Fantastic thanks and thanks to all four.Of you for joining I think.So at this point we're just going to.Sort of move into a discussion and i.Think again.Anyone who's watching feel free to.Submit questions via q a we will.Incorporate them into the discussion.When possible. and I think generally you know we're.Here to sort of talk about the finnscape.Fintech landscape in africa and to talk.About these solutions.To talk about sort of observations that.The people on the panel have about.What's going on in the world. and and I think I kind of want to.Start broad. and I think the question that i.Actually want to start with.Is each of you have a product that.Incorporates blockchain that targets a.Specific.Sort of user base how did you identify.That user base.And how did you decide that blockchain.Was a good solution to sort of.Offer them and I guess i'll I know.That this will become a more.Freewheeling conversation but.I think to start with I will just call.On tori.Since she was the last to speak sure and.And we might be the most.Niche market play of everyone.Represented today so happy to start.I mentioned that we started with.Refugees and this became apparent.To my co-founder not robinson and I as.We were really digging into the refugee.Crisis. before looking at the technology side.So we identified that there was this gap.In the market where.Up to 80 of the the cross-border market.In africa is still cash based it's.Informal so people are crossing the.Border with cash in hand.Which can be very dangerous but then it.Also is just expensive over time it's.Inconvenient.And it doesn't allow people to move into.The formal economy over time so we saw a.Significant gap there.And in looking at ways to formalize that.And and to do it with a sustainable.Business we saw blockchain as a really.Good option.This was early 2018 so the landscape was.A little bit different.But we knew from the bat that or right.Off the bat that.Bitcoin and ethereum were not going to.Be a good fit for what we needed because.We knew that we would be dealing with.Small transaction sizes and a customer.Base that didn't have.10 minutes to an hour to wait to know.The status of their transaction.And so as we started digging into.Different solutions we found Stellar.Through a contact of ours actually in.Mexico and.And we found that it was a really good.Technical fit.And so we we did look at other.Blockchains for sure.And eventually found our way back to.Sellers started building out the wallet.And during that time it was interesting.To see how the regulatory landscape.Changed as well and the attitudes.Towards blockchain so if anything i.Think over the last few years.It's become an even better fit for us.Because.Stellar makes it so much easier to work.With regulators and central banks.Because of the stablecoin approach that.We're able to take using our own custom.Assets.Acting as a by-proxy anchor for our.Wallet customer base.So we also we work with licensed.Entities to hold and move funds so that.Makes it easier as well but.But overall I think the approach was.Identify the problem.Identify who it touches and their unique.Needs and then find a technical solution.To fit that need.Great does anyone else have like I mean.There's there's a lot of interesting.Stuff there but.Before we sort of move on to talk about.Regulatory questions and things like.That.Does anyone else have like something.That they can say or.Perspective on how they selected their.User base or how they decided to explore.Blockchain as a solution for problems.That their users face.How about so let's move in there so.On our side we don't actually.Expose a lot of like blockchain.Functionalized to our users except for.The assets that.We will we allow them to buy and sell.And send and receive.In the app and we're adding a bunch of.Stellar assets on there very soon. but like it's more of our operational.Backend right so.You know in in a good month we'll be.Moving anywhere between 80 to maybe 150.Million dollars a month across.African currency pairs it is very.Expensive to try and do a conversion to.Us dollars and then like convert us.Dollars back into whatever like.Destination currency. that you actually have so like I can.Give you an example one of our most.Popular corridors. is uganda and nigeria both ways right.One might not typically imagine that.There's quite a bit of cross-border.Trade that takes place.Between those two markets but our data.Seems to suggest otherwise.So we can find ourselves in a scenario.Where.Today we have way too much naira in.Nigeria.And the other day we have got way too.Much ugandan shillings in uganda how do.We quickly move. money around across these currency.Pairs such that we.We are not unnecessarily losing money.By.Doing unnecessary conversions to the us.Dollar at.Typically unfavorable rates so you'll.Find that like most forex bureaus bureau.De challenge banks.Will not have like an exchange rate for.The nigerian.Naira to the ugandan shilling but if you.Look at stable coin pairs you can find.Either a direct the conversion rate.Between the two currency pairs.Or a currency pair that's like a lot.More cost efficient than. translating to the us dollar.Typically something like usdc.So it started making a lot of sense to.Us very er.Early after encountering encountering.This problem that.Stable coins might be the way to go here.The biggest challenge of course has been.Around getting.Our our partners and we work mostly with.Banks in many markets to be able to.Move money around getting our bank.Partners to have a high degree of.Comfort. around stable coins and how those.Stable coins are backed.Has been a bit of a challenge though.We've been able to make a lot of headway.And I think the future is promising what.What's.Most encouraging for me about it is that.Once the regulators and other.Stakeholders.Start to understand the cost benefits.Of using this approach and once they see.Some examples at scale.Of other countries and other.Jurisdictions where there's been a.Common sense regulatory framework that.Has worked and.Has not collapsed or created some degree.Of chaos it's very easy for.Other countries in the region to adopt.And copy that sort of model and I think.It will.It will be a much more different.Landscape in the next three to five.Across the continent.Great I mean yeah.Yeah for us it's it's been quite. we also don't. really showcase it to the user.As in that since it's a similar.Situation and similar reasons.As chipper cache and I believe i.Wanted to add there that one of the.Reasons we.We chose the Stellar blockchain.Is also the I mean obviously the.Division.Of the Stellar.Development foundation which we.Felt very aligned with but also a lot.Of.A lot of action which is also quite.Important so.I think SDF has been over the last.Couple of years.Put a lot of effort behind building a.Good ecosystem.So whether it be anchors wallets traders..More and more parties are coming to the.Ecosystems.And the operations that the Stellar.Blockchain offers.Therefore are getting quicker and more.Efficient and it also makes it cheaper.And that all in a in a decentralized way..One example is for example adding of.The.The usdc.Stellar asset which was added earlier.This year.These are all great developments that.Make the ecosystem much better which.Benefits everyone that interacts with.The ecosystem.And yeah that's only only getting.Better so that has also been.One of the reasons for us that we we.Went for the Stellar blockchain.Great and we're getting some good.Questions in the q a too and one of them.Sort of touches on something that's come.Up a few times which is.Basically regulations and the.Question from peter is how have the.Participants found complying with the.Travel rule slash.Wire transfer regulations and.Demonstrating this to regulators and.Banking partners.So question about the travel rule and.Wire transfer regulations. are there challenges in complying.With regulations.Is that one of the big challenges that.You face .I guess rick maybe just you can answer.That one since you're.Since you're on the spot still sure. yeah the the countries we are.Operating. the cryptocurrency regulation.Is all very young and non-existing. so we we've taken quite a pragmatic.Approach to it and you do the trial.And error approach so.For us for all use case we are an anchor.On the.On the network issuing.Tokens which.People can can.Buy or sell and.That that fitted for us in existing.Regulation. and yeah.To be able to buy and sell you need a.Bank partner. so we also regularly. like sit with them and and see how to. adjust how we how we approach. regulation or or compliance or aml.Around this.Does anyone else want to speak about.Sort of regulatory challenges or just.Regulation in general victoria looks.Like you're ready.To go sure yeah and only because we get.To have this conversation like five.Times a day with.Everyone right it's the first thing that.Anyone asks about when they hear.What we're doing especially if we.Mention refugees just because there's a.Stereotype there.But we actually we put all of our.Customers through.Stringent kyc and aml checks at.Onboarding and then. they're able to do transactions.Within the system but of course.There are limits on that so I think.One of one of the advantages of building.In africa.Is that widely .There has been some regulatory treatment.Of e-money in the last 10 to 15 years.Starting with in pesa and kenya and.Expanding into mobile money and mobile.Banking.Across the continent and so when we.Approach regulators to say.This is what we're doing this is the.Approach that we're taking this is a.Digital representation of value.That is stored and held with licensed.Financial institutions.In fiat behind the scenes that sounds.Familiar to them.Because it sounds it fits the framework.That they have for.Mobile money for example in east africa.So I think that we've.We've found a lot of success using that.Approach and it's definitely part of our.Growth strategy to identify areas that.The regulatory treatment of leaf is.Going to be favorable. that's I think that that is changing.Globally.And it's probably going to be a while.Before every country has.Explicit regulation on blockchain or.Crypto based digital wallets but I think.In the next five years there probably.Will be some sort of framework for.E-value generally and so again the.The way that we do that.Is is very important for our long-term.Success it's not just.Because there's a framework here or.Anyone can succeed I mean we've put.A lot of thought and intention into the.Design to make it work for the existing.Frameworks.The potential for change over time and.And working within the maybe informal.Political relationships of the existing.Landscape because.It doesn't at the end of the day it.Might not matter only what the law says.It matters who's already in the space.And and how.What they're doing how they're being.Treated and so making sure that we can.Play nicely with.Licensed commercial banks telcos.Psps payment providers or payment.Processors that's all very important to.Us and so our our solution is very much.Meant to play nicely so that we can get.Traction with existing financial.Institutions and regulators because if.It only works.At the tech layer and it doesn't work in.The real world then it doesn't work at.All.So I think that's that's been our our.Approach and all of that and it seems to.Be working well so far at least in.East africa.Yeah so just to follow up on you know.Tory and rick .I'm was seeing like more .Well I say kind of opening up rights of.Regulators. so in nigeria where I live.For example there was the brush you.Know. kind of ban on just general crypto.Activities. and almost an extent of you know.Making it almost.In a way criminal but then earlier.This month we've seen the cba and the.Central bank say. you know they're working on you know.A central bank digital currency.Which is which to me is kind of positive. it's.To me it's it seems to be like there's.Some engagement with stakeholders.And then they're beginning to understand.You know how this works. and I expect that we'll continue to.See that across.You know multiple governments across.The continents. it might not be like easy over like.And as smooth as we would expect it to.Be especially in countries where.You don't have the framework of mobile.Money or a money.You know for context right and so.Well I believe it's going to be with.With the work that is being done by.You know most lots of the companies like.Chipakash .Global will you know will probably see.More friendliness from.From regulators over the coming years.Without any insights on regulatory.Compliance.And the challenges involved hopes plans.Dreams.Yeah I guess there's two parts.I'd want to think about the first was in.Reference to like the travel rule.So we've been fortunate enough that like.A lot of our.Transactions for under the fincen.Threshold limit which was previously i.Think three thousand dollars is now.Being.Proposed to be as low as 250.A lot of our transactions are typically.Below that amount but higher in.Frequency.So you know you don't have to .Be as stringent when following that.Though we do have like the.Infrastructure in place to be able to.Pass on all of the relevant.Parameters regarding the transaction so.You know the address the name.Transaction amount the stated purpose.Etc so we can pass that programmatically.As parameters to our payment partners.When they're processing so they have a.Record. of all of these informations as and.When the transactions are taking place.So it's actually not that hard in terms.Of you know being compliant.What is challenging is that the.Regulatory frameworks are you know.Highly fragmented across markets.So you need to set up like a separate.Compliance structure. in each and every country like of the.160 people that are working at your.Broadcast today.About 60 of them are in the legal risk.And compliance team.And and you know this is like a very.Software heavy.Service like we've got like 40 engineers. so you can imagine how. seriously we take that and we found.That like you know.Engaging the regulator early a lot of.The times we have this almost.Perspective that.The regulator is not pro innovation they.Want things to say the certain way or.That they don't understand.I think that's not the right attitude to.Approach conversations with the.Regulator like there are people.Just as much as you and me I'm sitting.In the office of all of these central.Banks but then their incentives are very.Different from ours.And what is a the most useful approach.Has been.Demonstrating technical mechanisms.Which satisfy the the requirements and.The interests that the regulators have.You know.We've been able to set up this.Cross-border wallet in south africa one.Of the most.Strictly regulated financial services.Markets in the world. by taking the surprise to say like.Okay guys we want to do this thing.We know that no one has done it quite.Like this before but how do we make it.Happen as opposed to. the law says we can't make it happen.You know so I think. by taking that fragmented approach.And investing in those relationships.Early. you'll be able to set up and and.Scale quite quickly in some of these.Markets.There's another question that was.Asked by afolabi. in regards to crypto saying for.Crypto related companies like chipper.Cash will allow users to use btc on app.How do you comply with local regulations.So it's about understanding.What the state of the regulation is in.That market and.Adapting as and when things change.Before the central bank of nigeria.Directive we allowed all of our users in.Nigeria to transact.We've since disabled that.Functionality for.Those nigerian users in order to comply.With the new regulation.In markets like uganda and south africa.You don't have an explicit explicit .Prohibition.Of crypto we're able to run the services.And we are actually trying to help.To formulate some common sense.Frameworks that enable.The regulator to to regulate crypto.Effectively.And even in markets like nigeria it's.Important to note that the prohibition.Was .It is not illegal to own or hold.Cryptocurrencies.But the the central bank did instruct .Centralized exchanges.To not connect to the centralized.Banking systems so there's been very.Interesting ways that people have.Gone around that.Sort of like setting up digital and.Physical agent networks.And we're exploring some of that in some.Of our markets to see whether it might.Be a viable alternative.Yeah it's interesting I mean one thing.That I'm thinking about as you're.Telling that story is that you have to.Be able to adapt to sudden change right.You don't necessarily know what's coming.Next there's a lot of uncertainty and as.New information comes in you have to.Sort of figure out.Where to steer and you have to be pretty.Nimble so I guess one thing I'm curious.About from all of you is like what is.Sort of most unexpected thing that's.Happened as you've been building.Your company and how did you respond. tori do you want to go go ahead I saw.You come off me.No no go ahead go for it thanks yeah so.There have been like several scenarios.Where especially in our earlier days.When we were like operating in certain.Markets and we didn't have a very much.For compliance structure.You know we'll be having the time of our.Lives all-time highs.Incredible volumes and then your partner.Processor just calls you and says.We've received the cease and desist.Letter to shut down your services.Immediately like and it's like at 2.Am.Right and like there's no explanation.There's no negotiation there's like yeah.You can come and talk about it next week.But like right now.We're seizing and assisting this because.We don't understand exactly what you're.Doing.And this happens this has happened to us.Quite a lot especially in the year 2019. it's really been a function of not.Like really having the right.Relationships and. having the right structures in place.To manage these adverse events as and.When they occur.Something that is a bit counterintuitive.It's a bit controversial but i'll still.Say it anyway.It's my personal belief that a lot of.The the people in power sometimes the.People in positions of power.They might not be there because they.Like meritocratically earned that.Position right they're not like.The absolute smartest people to be.Sitting in that role.Due to some other factors maybe there's.Like the president's cousin and whatever.Else.They're sitting in some you know really.Important position in a central bank or.Something.Now that individual does not necessarily.Have the exposure and acumen to be able.To assess the viability of your business.Purely on marriage.Right and that is like a fundamental.Reality of the structures and.Institutions that we have.In africa today a lot of people seem not.To pay attention to the fact that.African republics as an idea are about.50 to 60 years old.And you're applying frameworks and.Regulatory structures from countries.That have had.Institutions for hundreds if not.Thousands of years it doesn't really.Work the same.So in a scenario like that in that type.Of environment it is.Really really important that you know.The right people in every country.Such that when you get flagged for doing.Something those people are able to make.A case on your behalf.To help the other people who might be in.Positions of power.To understand that you're not actually.Trying to break the law you're trying to.Introduce a new level of innovation.Which is compliant which is actually.Helping some of the government and.The state.Actors to achieve their intended targets.And that is a lot easier said than done.But I think you know investing in.Relationships and making sure that.You're always communicating. preemptively has been very very.Useful in helping us. maintain this type of business across.The continent.I'm gonna jump on that because that's.That's our experience at least the first.Part as well when somebody a partner.Just calls and says. we noticed this this growth on your.And it's become big enough that it's.Been flagged by our partners and now.We're gonna have to put a hold on.Everything until we understand exactly.What's happening.And and the reaction of course on our.Side is well we've been through.Compliance we've been through these.Conversations this isn't this is not a.Surprise. it's great that we're growing that.Fast that we you know caused a flip in.Your entire system but.That's that shouldn't be the.Conversation we're having today.And and so I think that for us it's been.A matter of.Intentional duplication within the.System to make sure that.When that happens with one partner we.Can very quickly.Adapt and shift to another and so making.Sure that we are truly an.Integrations hub with lots of options to.Keep our our operations going and to.Provide flexibility for our customers is.Really important.And then the other thing that I would.Add I think the the relationships.Point is.Is spot on those always help no matter.Where you are .But also I think there's this there's.This gap.Where again it doesn't matter at the end.Of the day.Well it doesn't only matter what the law.Says or what the regulations say.It matters who is looking at those and.And.How they're interpreting them and so we.Before we go into any market spend a lot.Of time looking at the regulatory.Framework.And what exactly we can do and can't do.And we make sure to comply with that.We want to be able to serve customers.And we want to be able to operate and.We want to stay within the law but if.You get somebody who.Is not in a position where that's part.Of their day-to-day job and they don't.Understand.Exactly what we're doing they don't.Understand exactly what a blockchain is.Perhaps behind the scenes that's always.A big buzzword. you know they can set people's risk.Factors off and so. if that person is the one who is.Tasked with.Deciding somebody's fate.They usually are not the ones who want.To stick their necks out on the line and.So.Making sure that we we understand.Exactly what the law says and we're able.To communicate that effectively to.People who probably should know it but.Really don't. has been a big challenge for us and i.Think we.Think we're getting better at it but we.Still come across it all the time.Yeah it's interesting I mean well joseph.Or rick do you have anything to sort of.Add on this topic anything.About the biggest surprises how you've.Dealt with them now for.For us it's been similar similar.Examples.Similar fears of shutting down.An account and I think especially for .Sort for.Fintechs in in especially in africa.Is that it's quite important .When when the product is evolving that.You you keep flexibility.In your product and because yeah those.Things are.Unfortunately there and yeah if you.You.You can't respond quick enough .That that means that yeah it can kill.Your business for a while.So flexibility is definitely .Something you need to have as a fintech.Yeah definitely so in in in an area.For my life I was the co-founder of.The fintech.And these experiences are very like very.Similar. where you have partners just.Basically. in in you know in in our case.You know we our customers just couldn't.Do a transaction anymore a certain kind.Of trans.Transaction anymore and then you know we.Reach out to our partners and like oh we.You know we cut you off because you know.This.The central bank reached out and you.Know and so.Yeah it's it's being able to you know.Have multiple partners. constantly like wizard said you know.Constantly being.Like you know build relationships .With both regulators and your partners.Such that.You know it's easy to overcome you know.Times like this but.Yeah generally they'll just always come.Up you almost can't avoid them.Yeah I guess the the this is also sort.Of a general question right.If so far we've sort of been talking.About the solutions that you built and.The customers that you serve.But I think there's also people in the.Audience who are sort of budding.Entrepreneurs who are interested in.Hearing about your experiences actually.Building a fintech and.You know being able to like sort of.Respond to unexpected circumstances. to be flexible that that seems like.Part of it but I guess.I'm also interested in any advice that.You would have for someone who's.Interested in starting.A fintech company or who's interested in.Scaling one that they've started. like what what's like sort of the is.There.Is there a number one thing that you.Would suggest to keep in mind if you're.Trying to build your own business.Yeah I can I can mention a thing .It doesn't only fit on fintech.Businesses for for starting businesses.In general. don't don't try to be.Don't try to be everything and and do.Everything.And I think.In the fintech it's it's more important.Because you need to.Take off quite some boxes like.Regulation you need to have.A partner if you if you're doing.Anything with. financial activity. often yeah you need to.Need various of elements in your.Business to together to work and I think.What is important there is to really.Look okay.What is your what is your core business.Like where are you get in.As a starting fintech business and try.To.Outsource us as much as possible so yeah.Don't try to build your own.Kyc aml solutions there are multiple.Players in the market.And then that's for those other.Activities as well try to.Focus on your on your core.And and yeah utilize .Your existing existing solutions in the.In the market.Of course that's a little bit different.When you when you grow but I think it's.It's.Very important to do that in the.Beginning.I think mine would be similar to that .Along the lines of the core business.Team.I think I would just say for someone.Starting ventucker otherwise but.Especially fintech.Know the details because there's so.Much that technology can do.These days that we often forget.Why we're doing things or or what we.Need.To really be successful we see success.Stories in the news every day and it.Seems like.You could throw any tech solution at the.Wall and something would stick.But I think that especially for.Fintech being in a highly regulated.Space especially for building in.Markets that might not have.As robust of an environment whether.That's africa or somewhere else.It really does come down to knowing the.Details so knowing the details of your.Customers.And their ux ui preferences and.Their their needs on a day-to-day basis.And their comfort level with technology.Knowing the regulatory landscape knowing.Your partner's comfort level with risk.And any any stipulations that.They might have to adhere to or that.They might be under so i.I think that the details are where it.Can fall apart or succeed greatly but.Knowing them.Enables you to set up a business that.Has a much higher chance of success.And then be able to effectively defend.Those decisions.Over time because if you're building in.The fintech landscape.You're going to have to defend every.Single one of the thousands of decisions.That you make on a day-to-day basis to.Potential investors and partners and.Regulators and customers.And anyone else who touches your.Ecosystem so I think as much as you can.And be able to defend that the better.Joseph orweeza you want to touch this.One.Well oh very you know very similar. it's and it's like like rick said.Beyond just fintechs right it's.Knowing like knowing your you know your.Product knowing what you're trying to.Build. I think one of the.One of the best ways to put it will.Be to.Build the product first before the.Business right .It's a bit tricky in a fintech.Especially with regulation and stuff.But it's mainly in a way.You I believe that you still have.You have some room to ask for.Forgiveness. you know before begging for.Permission right. and so for as much as you can play.I'll say like you know just get make.Sure that you have a solid understanding.Like tori said.Of of the product you're trying to build.Of your users. of what they want of what is really.Important to them. and in the same vein almost at the.Same time.Work on building very strong.Relationships with you know partners. your relationship with partners will.Probably.In many cases make or break you it's.Very important that you make sure that.Those relationships are strong and.In many cases they'll protect you.Especially if you're like you know a.Fintech starting out.Most of your partners are probably going.To be the ones to protect you from.You know like heavy hits from regulators.Right.So making sure those relationships are. are really tight and I think.Wizard referenced you know kind of.Finding out what their motivations are.And then you know walking around those.Just as opposed to.Beyond just regulators just your.Partners know where your partner's.Motivations are and make sure that you.Know you're working with them.You know to achieve whatever they also.Want to achieve while you're achieving.What you want to achieve.So basically yeah.Is that anything to add no I think.Between what tori and joseph have shared.They have captured.All of my ideas great I mean one thing i.Think about as.As you're discussing all this is I think.Okay the Stellar network is a great.Back-end platform for sort of storing.And transferring value and ideally.In my mind at the sitting here at the.Stellar development foundation I imagine.All these different organizations.Ecosystem participants would build on.The network.And be able to like interoperate right.To be able to work with one another.To forge partnerships to make payments.Across borders and across currencies.But I also realized that that's a sort.Of you know that's.My utopian vision of how Stellar should.Work. and I'm curious about.Your views on interoperating with other.People in the Stellar ecosystem or.In sort of the fintech ecosystem in.General how important.Is it that your sort of solutions that.You're building play well with others.And what are the biggest chat like.Doesn't do they currently.And if and whether they do or not like.Sort of what are the biggest.Challenges to interoperation. I have a bunch of thoughts on this.One so I think. interoperability is like the next big.Barrier for.Digital financial services across the.Continent .We have seen relatively high penetration.In terms of especially urban centers.But like you know we still have a long.Way to go in digitizing finance right.Network international who operates .Probably the largest point-of-sale.Terminal network for banks across the.Continent.Their latest data from last year.Indicates that 93.Of transactions across the continent.Retail transactions are still in cash.So all of this fintech we're doing is.Lovely and the volumes are impressive.But like.We have a long way to go that's one now.Another side of that bucket is that.Different countries.Have got fragmented solutions on a per.Country.Basis so even in individual markets .Native interoperability.Is not yet where it needs to be there.Are a few notable examples tanzania has.Got really good interrupt uganda.So and so I'm not sure about the latest.In rwanda maybe tory can chime in there.But there's there's still quite a lot of.Work to be done on a on a national.Level.Once we have the national systems all.Of the digital financial systems.Interoperable.And and I'm pleased to see that over the.Last three years. a lot of the bank and mobile money.Interoperability problems.In east africa and southern africa have.Have been solved quite well.But once we have that national.Interoperability the next question is.Now around like international.Transactions interoperability.And it was I think actually this week.That afri exim bank.Is piloting a continental payment system.That is going to be used to facilitate. a trade of intra-africa currency.Pairs like the ones that I described.Earlier.This is consistent with the african.Continental free trade areas.Policy towards unifying africa towards a.Single market.So I do think that like you know .Interoperability.Is is probably the most important thing.We have to do at this stage it doesn't.Matter if.You know my money is sitting in cheaper.And and tori has hers in leave.Why can't I send my money from my.Chipper wallet to to tory's.Leaf wallet we both support the ron and.Frank we both support.The kenyan shipping we have a long way.To go some of the.The standards that are being developed.Such as moja loop.Could be something that's quite exciting.But again they're targeted towards.Specific verticals that is the telco.Industry we're over the top financial.Service players.If we don't do interoperability we'll.End up with a scenario where.You've got many monopolies in various.Regions which is almost the status quo.To date.So definitely something that needs to.Happen I think that blockchains are an.Obvious solution towards.Interoperability I just haven't seen.I think that the biggest barrier the.Technology exists today.But the biggest barrier is fintechs in.Africa don't have like a unified.Association.The way the telcos do so moja loop is.Being pushed to the telcos.Through the gsma which is the industry.Association the first thing we need to.Do.Is unionize and bring out an association.Of over the top of financial service.Players and then agree on what sort of.Standards we're going to use.For interoperability I don't think it's.Been as much of an issue in other.Markets because europe has got the.Eurozone.So if the currency is natively.Interoperable you don't have to worry.The united states is a single market.China is also a single market.India is also a single market but we.Compare ourselves with these.Regions and meanwhile we are 54 very.Distinct and very unique.Countries with unique needs challenges.And opportunities.So definitely I think the next unicorns.Are going to be.Interoperability platforms out of africa.And it's a fantastic.Opportunity for those who are willing to.Give it a shot in solving.I I completely agree with that I think. the fragmented markets that you.Mentioned.Are the biggest opportunities as well .So if the telcos are not going to solve. you know in rwanda today it's very.Difficult to send between mtn.And airtel if they're not going to.Solve it for themselves because.Of the the competition between those.Then that's an incredible opportunity.For somebody like leaf or tripper or.Other fintech plays to come in and solve.It for them so.I've i've been excited to see that there.Are definitely companies stepping into.Those gaps I think they've started at.The business level so the b2b plays. that's that's been a lot easier and.Then hopefully the.Benefits of interoperability and.Bridge plays will come down to the.Consumer level.Over time that's that's where leaf is.Trying to play of course.And we see significant opportunity there.And I genuinely hope that others will.Come into the space as well because.It is it is such a fragmented market and.There is so much opportunity.I think one thing that .Is a potential barrier to.Interoperability is the word itself.And so I don't know if it's I don't.Know if it's helpful.Just to start with talking about.Integrations everybody loves.Integrations right they're easy we know.How to do them. they're very accessible for most.Companies and so.If instead of going into you know a room.Full of people and saying hey let's all.Become interoperable.If it's having those conversations to.Say how can you and I integrate today.And over time that creates a network.Fantastic.It'll help us get there and so for.Myself you know I look at it and I'm.Like well.Great we already have assets for rondon.Frank's canyon shillings uganda.Shillings on the Stellar network.That's very easy for us to to push into.Chipper's wallet for example so.You know if we want to have a.Conversation after this and talk about.What that looks like. great because we already have that.Asset I think that my.My fear in this is that we keep abiding.By the same playbook.Over time and so it's you know leaf leaf.Created these assets because we didn't.See anybody else out there who.Had them but you know that's.That could also be justified for other.Companies coming into the space you know.If they're a new company in rwanda that.Have wanted to have their own.Rondon frank coin on Stellar they could.Do that it's unnecessary they should.Just use ours and we should learn how to.Play nicely together but .But I understand the business reasoning.And the fear that could create.That landscape where everyone just.Continues to do their own thing.So I think we are very very pro.Integration.And very pro interoperability Stellar.Is a good tool for that and I think as.The network is still fairly limited.In in africa but it's growing and we.Hope that.You know by sharing our experiences and.Our lessons learned there's been a lot.Of them.Potentially we can help other players.Coming into that space as we're growing.Ourselves because of course.We're still very new in the game as well.Great I mean joseph do you have.Something to add to that.Yeah so I really like . taurus points on integrations. that's that's actually.That seems to be like a more or kind.Of like .Friendly approach one.One thing so we talked about mojo loop.And so i've been kind of involved with.With that movement for a bit one of.The issues you see.Is many com many you know startups that.Should adopt it.All are looking to adopt it to realize.For example you probably need to have.Like a switch.Right in nigeria it's going to cost.You a lot of money.To have like a switching license right.And then.You have this thing where the startups.Say they want to come together.And then build like one switch that they.Can use to connect like you know moja.Loop in another country.There's like all that kind of.Complexity.Around it and so just starting with.Integration seems to me like a very like.You know fair approach like you know as.Much as possible if lots of startups you.Know puts together.The exposed apis like to connect to each.Other. then maybe that's that'll be like a.Great start.And then we can start talking about you.Connecting across different brothers.Like countries so that that looks that.Sounds very.You know plausible to me.Yeah I wanted to add to that that will.Be interesting to. to see a couple of players in in the.African market that actually.Try to to become such a.Central switch for example mfs africa.Is trying to do that .And then on the other side you have of.Course Stellar. which is try to achieve that in a.Decentralized way .With with as a non-profit having a.Certain.Open source standards it will be.Interesting to see. yeah which way it's gonna .It's going to lean whether it will be.More with a central party. or it will go decentralized.And I think it will take a bit of.Time but.Expect that that at some point it will.Lean more.Decentralized on for example Stellar.Open source.And having open source standards and.Actually.Yeah a central party or that's at least.What I hope.Because if it becomes a central party.One or two players then it's.The question whether it really becomes.Cheaper.Great thank you so I personally.Feel like that's a great place to end.This sort of dream of hope.That these standards for integrations.Become.You know sort of tend towards the open.Source of course as.Someone at the SDF who is prizes for the.Open source culture and believes.That this network should be.Permissionless and owned by everyone and.Easily accessible and that we should.Work together to create similar.Standards.Rather than having one single party own.Them that sounds great to me.And I would love to see that happen but.Of course you know what is interesting.Is that what happens next is up to the.People here and the people listening.People in the world in general the.People who are building businesses.And also to their users like what is.Going to succeed and I think.Only time will tell but.At this point I do want to take these.Last few minutes because as I mentioned.At the top of the presentation or at the.Top of the panel.We the SDF are working with dfs.Lab to sponsor a bootcamp.And I just want to take these last few.Minutes so that anyone to give some.Information so that anyone listening.Understands what that means.What it can do for them and how to apply.And so I want to.Thank everyone for their participation.Thank you so much.And pass it over to joseph so he can.Tell us a little bit about the boot camp.Yeah thanks justin so.We're working so dfs lab is working with.The Stellar development foundation.It's to kind of open up an opportunity.For.Early to mid-stage startups who are.Interested.In building a solution for on stella.Who are interested in building on stella. for africa. we are looking you know.At basically it's it.They block the bootcamp follows like a.You know design sprint approach where.Over a period of three days you go from.You know idea to prototype. in.Where you you follow a bunch of steps.Right to go from idea to prototype.By three-day period and then we have.Demo day on the fourth day where.Startups .Or participants can win you know.Anywhere from five thousand to twenty.Thousand usdc. in prices so.The most promising startups you know.During the event. and there are also opportunities for.Follow-up funding. from the Stellar development.Foundation enterprise fund.And other investors who .At the boots got the demo day right.And then and it's kind of open to.Fintechs open to companies that are.Currently building on the blockchain. and then companies that are just you.Know you know thinking of it.Like the way we refer to them as .Cryptocurious companies who are building. it's open to so to any of those type.Of people to.To apply you can visit the websites.You see on the screen right now .The link on the screen to apply.Applications clues on the 20th of.August.And yeah if you have any questions about.It. feel free to email me that's joseph.Dfslab.net. but I'm fairly positive like you know.You have all the information you need on.On the website. so please feel free to apply we're.Looking forward to having you.Great yeah thanks everyone so obviously.As joseph said you can visit that link.On the screen to find out more you can.Email.Joseph dfslab.net.Applications as it says close august.20th and.Our goal here is to sort of help support.And incubate projects in africa that are.Focused on.Fintech solutions that solve real-world.Problems .And that's that's the end I really want.To say that this was it was a real.Privilege to have.All four of you here thank you so much i.Know that we just scratched the surface.But I feel like we started to get into.Some interesting areas. and to talk about you know what's.Going on in the region in.Integrations and also I think there.Was some really interesting nuggets for.People who are interested in building.Their own.Companies or scaling their own companies.So I really appreciate it and.I hope that everyone out there listening.Also came away with something.We do plan to have more of these .Ecosystem roundtables in the future.So you can always find out more about.Those by just going to `stellar.org`.Events thanks everyone for participating.And for watching.
