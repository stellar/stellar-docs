All right everybody it's been a it's.Been a long day but I hope a very.Productive one and it is enclosing the.First day of Meridian I am so pleased to.Present our next and final speaker.Denelle Dixon the executive director of.The stouts Ehlert development foundation.So thank you all very much and let's.Give a really warm welcome to Janelle.[Applause].Hi everyone good afternoon I'm back as.They say so I thought I would start by.Just mentioning that I joined SDF six.Months ago last Friday so it's been a.Journey for me I can't believe that it's.Been six months and yet at the same time.I can't believe that it's only been six.Months so there's a lot that I've.Learned a lot that I've learned about.All of the work that you're doing a lot.That I've learned about Stellar and it's.Been pretty phenomenal.So I worked at Mozilla for seven years.And at Mozilla which is my role just.Prior to this I was the chief operating.Officer I did a lot of work focused on.The open web focused on ensuring that.Government's didn't have access to.Technology with backdoors talking about.Encryption and privacy and all of these.Issues that our core tenants to the open.Web transparency and so when Jed came to.Talk to me and he talked to me about.This role as the executive director and.CEO I thought I had to reflect on how.All those things that I'm so passionate.About about openness and transparency.And fighting for the rights of the.Humans that actually use the content.Side of the web if all of those things.Could be equally translated over here to.What we're doing here at SDF and what.We're doing with Stellar and good news.Is it is so it's been a pretty wonderful.Transition for me to see all of the work.That has already been done and frankly a.Lot of the work that's done with respect.To blockchain technology it doesn't get.Highlighted enough I don't know if.That's because of fear or ignorance.Because of what regulators are concerned.About or because of history but one.Thing I'll have to say is that I think.Now is the time we need to actually.Really focus on getting more regulators.Involved understanding what we're doing.With blockchain now is the time.For us to come together and to develop.Excuse me to develop this community and.To get all those out there to become.Part of it I actually love one part of.What I've done over the last six months.In particular which is talking to those.Folks who have concerns about blockchain.And about Stellar in particular those.Naysayers out there that don't really.Maybe understand the technology and one.Thing I'll say is that you can overcome.A lot of those concerns when you have.Facts and you have evidence and when you.Have momentum and I think we have all of.That here and so I've had a lot of.Success talking to folks maybe even to.Some of those folks that I wanted to.Bring on to SDF to be part of what we're.Doing here to really engage them in the.Value that we have in this ecosystem and.What we can do and what actually Stellar.And blockchain generally can deliver not.Just in financial services but outside.Of it so the underlying tenets of the.Internet all those things that I really.Fought so hard for for the last 15 17.Years I think they're actually more true.In this space than in any other right.Now standards openness the focus on not.Creating trust through contracts but.Creating trust through transparency.Creating trust that exists because you.Can actually see touch and feel those.Are the things that the internet was.Based on you know back in the day with.Security they used to talk about you.Don't have to know you don't have to.Trust me you can audit the code the same.Is true in this space even more so today.Than it is on the on the content side of.The web and that's really exciting to me.And I think as a result of that we just.Have so much that we can do in this.Space but we have to continue to focus.On interoperability standards openness.Transparency because if we do that it's.Really hard to fight against the work.That we're trying to get here so I want.To just mention again I talked this.Morning a little bit about SDF as a role.As the connector as the.The bringing folks together the convener.And because of the growth of Stellar and.What we've done here as a collective it.Feels a lot like we're able to do that.Not just through things like Meridian.But through all of our work and so I.Reflected a lot on the role of Stellar.As we as we think about like what it is.That we're doing here what it is that.That the role of the Stellar development.Foundation is as we get through this and.I think it's really important to to talk.About Stellar development foundation.Itself instead of Stellar because many.Of you know that we Shepherd the.Codebase that we do lots of things but.Many of you probably don't know the.Details of what SDF is and so I thought.Maybe I would go into that a little bit.First we're a non-profit why is that.Important we don't have shareholders why.Is that important there is not one.Person who can actually benefit and who.Actually gets a dividend or a payout.With respect to anything that the SDF.Does that's important because that.Should build trust - so that's a really.Important fact that I want you to think.About the other thing is we're a tax.Payer we actually pay taxes in the state.Of California and at the federal.Government and we're not a charity and.Finally all of the capital that we have.At the SDF is actually used to support.And make Stellar than that work.Successful so we talk about this as no.Shareholder value no dividends no EBIT.Ah no stock price focus none of those.Like those things that you talk about.When you talk about corporate America we.Don't have those things we have all we.Have to think about is making Stellar.The global payment standard that's our.Daily goal that's our quarterly goal.That's our annual goal that's our only.Goal.So what we do is each of these things we.Spend our time building and supporting.Stellar in the ecosystem we create.Awareness and education around Stellar.And we develop and support Stellar use.Cases so that these are the things that.We do today some we've actually done.Better than others but this is what we.Focus on we have it says 54 it's.Actually wrong we have 55 we just hired.And he starts on Wednesday our chief.Marketing officer which I know many of.You have been clamoring for us to get we.Just hired him he starts on Wednesday so.It's 55 these are some of the titles of.The employees at the SDF we're across.Eight countries we have an office in San.Francisco we have an office in Brooklyn.New York and we have people who are.Located either as contractors and.Employees all over the world and this is.Important because our work is.Representative of what all of these.People all over the world do we want to.Be here for a really long time.Supporting all of your work and so this.Is something that I think it's good for.You to know so that you could access us.You can talk to us we have folks that.Are focused on integration alone and.These are important jobs and important.Roles for the SDF to play so now let's.Talk about the role of the SDF in the.Ecosystem and I did talk a little bit.About that as the convener and the.Connector and I mentioned Meridian and I.Really do think of the work that we do.Is bringing the whole globe together so.All of you bringing all of you together.To be able to focus on the work that we.Have ahead of us which is really.Creating Stellar as the Global Payments.Standard so there are things that we.Think through about what is our role.Today like how important is the SDF to.The ecosystem I'm going to tell you that.The role of SDF five years ago is very.Different than the role it has today.We're no longer at the center.Of the ecosystem which is super awesome.And this is one of the representations.The vote that occurred on October 28th.To regarding the inflation mechanism is.An important important example of.Demonstrating the decentralization of.The network but also the role that SDF.Plates we actually spent time looking at.The dev forums we saw the conversations.In Reddit on key base and it's our role.To sort of take the output from that and.Make a proposal which is what we did and.Then the vote happened on October 28th.And it fundamentally changed Stellar the.Network and it was really cool because.It definitely shows that feedback loop.And how that feedback loop work loop.Works we heard what you had to say we.Put a proposal out based on the feedback.And the network the validators accepted.That proposal another important way to.Determine our role is to think about.Franklin Templeton we learned about.Franklin Templeton's plans to build a.Mutual fund on Stellar not from them we.Got it from a Google Alert of all things.And it's demonstrates for me it was one.Of the more exciting days because it was.Like this is the way that this should.Work things like this should happen.Without people having to come to meet.With us and figure things out that means.That our documentation is better it.Means that they have determined the.Value of Stellar on their own that's.Exactly the kind of thing that we want.To see in a decentralized network and.Then if you look at the nodes and just.To think about the validator networks.Today two years ago we couldn't pull our.Validators off the network because it.Wouldn't continue to run today it can.And this is going to get even better and.Better as time as things progress so.From our standpoint this is a pretty.Cool place for us to be and our role is.Really solidified by all of you and the.Work that all of you have done as that.Convener as that connector so as we.Started to think about all these things.And think about our role.We came together to think about what are.The next 10 years and what does that.Look like for SDF and how do we actually.Ensure that we're doing our job which is.To make Stellar successful to make it.The payment standard so not surprisingly.In doing this work we had to reflect on.What's working and what hasn't worked as.Much as we would have liked so what it's.Working is our tatka it's scalable you.Guys are all contributing to it.Our people we've built an awesome team.Of folks who are not only committed to.The mission for SDF but are committed to.Stellar and that's awesome our community.Building look at Meridian you guys all.Came here to Mexico City to join us to.Celebrate all the work that you have.Done many excellent and promising.Projects like IBM Axio reality bits.Satoshi Pei lobster Stellar X so many.More and our focus on decentralization.As I just went through we feel like.We've actually kind of cracked that nut.So what hasn't been working so much.Our marketing some of you may say what.Marketing so we just hired our CMO yeh.It's not marketing for SDF it's.Marketing for Stellar marketing for all.Of you partnership marketing as well as.Network marketing our policy and our.Focus on regulatory efforts we've done.So much better over the last six to.Eight months and we're gonna get so much.Better we have a General Council now.Who's focused on this and we also are.Hiring a head of policy who's going to.Be focused on that from a global.Standpoint our lumen distribution.Through grants and air drops we've seen.Some pretty awesome results and yet we.Still hold a lot of lumens so from our.Standpoint it's not working as well as.We'd like and our transparency around.SDF now tried to fix some of that today.But you can't just do it once and let it.Sit there we got a.Continue that so we're gonna focus a lot.More on telling you more about what.We're doing with the capital that we.Have that wasn't me and about what we're.Doing just holistically as an.Organization that's our commitment to.You.So in reflecting on all of this and.Thinking about the ten years we really.Refocused our mission I mentioned this.Earlier today creating equitable access.To the global financial system it's an.Awesome mission as I mentioned I mean.Awesome in the sense that it's big but.We're committed it we're committed to it.And we want to use not just Stellar but.All the work that you guys have done to.Make this happen.And as we've reflected on it we also.Thought about what are some of the.Pillars that we need to put in play to.Help us to say yes this is the thing.That we should do and then to help us to.Say nope we shouldn't do this thing it's.Not consistent with what we need to.Focus on so we put these pillars.Together and we're gonna flush them out.As an organization in more detail so.That we can put our own sort of goals.And operational support behind them but.This is how we want to be seen we want.To be the blockchain that people know.And trust not for our own good but for.The good of all of you we want you to be.Comfortable building on it and knowing.That you're gonna be able to answer to.Whatever regulatory bodies you need to.Answer to we want you to feel.Comfortable knowing that you can trust.The network and that therefore you can.Tell others - we want to ensure.Robustness and usability of Stellar.Robustness and come encapsulate so many.Things security stability scalability.All of those pieces foster and develop.Real sustainable use case Stellar use.Cases so some of these will do ourselves.A lot of them you're gonna do and we're.Gonna help you and we're gonna help you.In ways that we have we're gonna help.You by marketing in ways that we maybe.Haven't because we want this to be.Successful so these are our pillars.These are the things that we think we.Need to focus on and we think that these.Things can actually help us say no too.Many things so.Now how do you make the plan happen so.Let's first focus on our resources.Whenever we spend money at SDF whether.It's to hire an engineer to put together.A marketing campaign to do any of those.Things we have to ask ourselves is this.Spent moving us closer to the adoption.Of Stellar as the global payment.Standard we consider that every time.That we do this so this is our question.That we ask ourselves every hire that we.Make all the different things that we do.In the organization and then we think.About our resources and as many of you.Know this is what our resources looked.Like before I started this talk so there.Were a hundred and five billion lumens.That existed in the world 20 of them.Were out in the world 17 wherefore.Sellers for SDF s operations and 68 were.Reserved for the giveaway programs that.Were administered by the the SDF so.Stellar isn't mind as most of you here.Know so the lumens that are now in the.Public hands are in the public hands.Because we worked really hard to get.Them in the public hands and we did that.Over the last four and a half years as.For the other two allocations there's.Been lots of thought about how we can.Distribute these and how we need to work.On them but the network and the.Community around Stellar are different.Than they were when we first started.They're much more robust and SDF can.Carry less weight now because of the way.Or the network is so we're just a piece.Of a much larger larger whole and the.Funds that we use that we have need to.Reflect that and so right before this.Talk we burned 50 billion lumens.And the way that that breaks down is.That we burned five billion lumens from.The SDF operating fund so we have 12.Billion there today or now we also.Eliminated the Stellar world giveaway.Program and the partnership program and.So 50 of those 68 billion lumens were.Also burnt so these are the remaining.SDF lumens that exist as of this talk.So we believe that the number of lumens.Now better aligns with our mission we're.Not gonna burn any more lumens that's an.Important point so all told as of now.There are 50 billion lumens that exist.In the world approximately 30 billion.Are in the hands of SDF and I'm going to.Go through how we broke those out and 20.Billion remain in the public this new.Mandate reflects our desire to do more.Of what has worked at SDF and for.Stellar and less of what hasn't worked.So let's dive a little deeper into this.From an operation standpoint you know it.Wasn't until really this year that we.Started hiring human capital which.Frankly is the most important capital.That we have at the SDF it's the team of.55 people that do all of the work to.Help to support Stellar and so many of.The folks that were out there in the.World that would have before maybe.Received grants partnership grants are.Now employees of the SDF and are.Committed to the mission of Stellar I'm.Excusing the mission of the SDF and to.Support Stellar and so we're going to.Continue to exercise that same standard.That I mentioned before which is just.Spending this lumen on our operations on.The human capital on the office space on.Marketing on all of these different.Things that we need to do are they is it.Moving us closer to Stellar becoming the.Global payment standard so we're going.To continue to do that with the 12.Billion lumens that we have we're also.Going to and we actually are going to.Issue a blog post right at the end of.This talk which has a lot more detail so.That you can read about it but we're.Also going to lock these lumens up for.Three billion a year for the next four.Years so that the SDF lumens that we use.For operations will release in.Mechanism over that time period so let's.Talk about the partnerships what was.Previously the partnerships program.We've broken that up into two so we have.The ecosystem support we have a lot of.Great work that's been done with respect.To infrastructure grants and the.Community fund and those are going to.Continue with 1 billion of the lumens.That we have now I should have also said.That each of these are going to be set.In accounts that are going to be public.So that folks can see them and you can.See when lumens are being utilized for.These different projects or these.Different programs that we have and so.We also have currency support for things.Like anchors or supporting the quiddity.In the market these are things that'll.Come out of a currency support bucket of.1 billion and then we have this new.Program that is the use case investment.Where we've set aside ten billion xlm.And what that's for is 2 billion of it.Will be used for the SDF to be able to.Build new products and use cases as we.Help to fill in pieces of the network.That we think need the support and we'll.Also that'll also show that will also.Have its own account and be visible to.Folks as they go through it as we start.Using the funds and then the Enterprise.Fund which is a slight twist and I think.A better way to think about partnership.Grants because what we can do with this.Enterprise Fund now is we can actually.Take equity in companies we can acquire.Companies and we can hold them as part.Of this enterprise fund but we can.Actually have more control and ability.To dictate what happens with respect to.Stellar and their use of Stellar and the.Movement of those companies in to an on.To the Stellar network so our intention.Is and then the and then any companies.That we acquire will be held in the name.Of SDF but it'll all return back into.This enterprise fund any monies that are.That are collected as a result of it.Remember we're a non-profit or a non.Shareholder so there's no entity there's.No one person here.Who gets access to any of the dividends.From this but these are I think this is.A really interesting way for us to be.Able to help to support the ecosystem in.A different and new way.And then the old giveaway program which.Frankly I think had some really.Wonderful success but again like to get.The sixty eight more billion lumens out.There in the world it was just going to.Be hard given what we've already seen.And the challenge that the challenges.That we faced some of them just.Technical challenges and some of them.Just getting them into the hands of.Humans.Well four billion of those are going to.Continue to go into the hands of humans.We're gonna focus on using applications.That are out there building on Stellar.Those we can put funds into those.Applications so that they can actually.Just get into human hands and be useful.To the network and to all of your work.That you're doing so that's that part of.It and then the two billion as I.Mentioned is marketing support and.That's marketing for Stellar but also.Marketing for the partnerships that come.And build on Stellar those businesses.Those developers who are focused on.Building on Stellar we're gonna work.With them you all of you we're gonna.Partner with you to actually promote all.The work that you're doing so that's.What that's gonna go so here is what it.Looks like again and again there will be.A blog post too so that you can take a.Look at it again this isn't the last.Time you'll see this and then a one.Question that I think we're gonna have.To answer is why burn it all well we.Didn't start by saying we wanted to burn.We actually started by saying what do we.Need.What does Stellar need and what is SDF.Need to be able to provide those things.To Stellar we had a very focused.Arrangement around only keeping what we.Actually could use because part of the.Challenge that we've had and this this.This weight not just on Stellar but the.Ecosystem was it as much as we wanted to.Use the lumens that we held it was very.Hard to get them into the market so that.Was the first premise of why burn at all.And the second one is you don't derive a.Plan from some arbitrary number and so.If we just took the 105 billion lumens.And then tried to derive a plan from it.That just doesn't.Like that's actually feeding the need.That we have to do for the ecosystem and.So we really thought we did a bottoms-up.Analysis and we thought what is it that.We need and then how do we get there so.That's how we approached it and we were.Very careful in terms of plotting the.Next ten years so now that we have our.Mission we have our pillars these.Strategic pillars that can help us to.Say yes and no and we have all of you.And all the work that you're doing and.We have right size the amount of capital.That we have available to us and to the.Ecosystem we feel we're like we're.Poised for success so I want to say.Again thank you to all of you for coming.Here to Mexico City to join us at.Meridian thank you for being a part of.Our ecosystem there are any naysayers.Out there in the crowd I'm happy to talk.To you and convince you about the facts.The evidence and the momentum of us.Moving forward because I'm convinced and.We're going to call that an afternoon..So now I'm gonna bring Jed up here and.We're gonna allow questions if any of.You have questions we have about 10.Minutes or so we're taking away your.Happy hour time but this is important we.Liked for Meridian to be an annual.Conference yes.Here's the microphone go ahead now that.It's on target.Now that you have rice right sighs as.You said the amount of capital and you.Have vested those 12 billion over the.Next four years the natural question is.What happens after four years well I.Think that what we did is we blocked.Them up three billion a year for the.Next four years that doesn't mean.They're all gonna be put into the into.The public at that point but I mean.Honestly the goal of the SDF was to be.Able to put those out as quickly as.Possible and so if there's some way that.We could get them out there that would.Be beneficial to the network but the ten.Years like this you don't just blow all.Your capital in a four year period you.Got to think about Treasury gotta think.About how you're gonna sustain an.Organization like this so that's our job.Like to figure that part out it doesn't.Mean four years from now that before.Four years from now we just say all.Right we're closing it down.Absolutely not we're in this for the.Long haul but we just need to think.About how we're gonna do that towards.The future.One of the most important parts of.Stellar's that decentralized exchange.But I think the liquidity so low that.Boosted up there any plans to.Incentivize market makers we actually.Already started making a market between.Nigeria and the US and we have that's.Part of the liquidity piece that I.Mentioned in the end points yeah I mean.I mean we try to incentivize that to.Some degree I mean a lot of it will come.From just getting more users on.Exchanges like Stellar port or Stellar X.Things like that but yeah it's it's a.Process so so several years ago you made.A concerted effort to not perform.Non-for-profit I think all of us agree.That was the perfectly right decision so.What do you think isn't the biggest.Challenge and opportunity going forward.To actually create an open financial.Global system well there's a lot of.Challenges I mean it's obviously that's.A very big mission I mean I think one of.The first things that we're trying to.Address is how do we achieve Network.Effects because this technology is not.Very useful unless there's a lot of.Different participants so how do we get.The first use cases on and that that's a.Lot of what we'll talk about tomorrow so.Yeah I think that the we call it the.Chicken and egg problem is the largest.Problem but I feel I don't know and.Maybe I'm just drinking my own kool-aid.Here but I do feel like we're on the.Precipice of success for all of those.Things and then you just need to get.User adoption so I feel like we all can.Come together to try to make that happen.But I do think it's this whole network.Like building the network in a way that.Is gonna bring everybody to the table at.The same time it seems like Global.Payment rail and remittances are kind of.The Courtney's case tellers have been.Solving very well I was attracted to it.Because of the developer Doc's thought.They were phenomenal so what do you guys.Hope to see the community develop from.Maybe a consumer application or what are.Some non remittances or Global payment.Style apps that you'd like to see built.Yeah I mean there's a whole host of.Things you can do on Stellar and I think.One of the most exciting things for me.Is like like hearing about projects that.I didn't anticipate or imagined before.Like for instance today someone showed.Me this app where you can have people.Bid on advertising it in a space like we.Could have a thing here and people could.Like bid on it and things like that like.Just kind of novel things that you don't.Really think of it or not that easy to.Do prior to Stellar world so I don't.Really have anything in particular in.Mind other than just I know that I'll be.Surprised by the people that the things.That people build on there and I'm.Excited by that so so I think one of the.Things we could do better from the.Community standpoint is because I don't.Have an application in specific but I.Think the community working together to.Get to know more of what's happening in.The community because I actually think.That all of you can support one another.Once you find out what's happening on.Stellar like this thing that he just.Heard about like we can actually build.Those things together so we're gonna do.Our own brand of like bringing the.Community together but I do think it's.Like being inquisitive as I mentioned.This morning why do people build on.Stellar is a good question to ask but.Also what are they building and I think.Once you find that out you can see that.That network effect happens when you.Actually think about it from the.Community standpoint.All right so we've been part of the.Community since 2016 and we've built a.Platform on top of Stellar now we are.Based in London originally we've just.Relocated to Amsterdam and one of the.Things we still keep getting when we.Attend events or networking events in.Space is we mentioned were built on.Stellar and many people go like why.Stellar and or we got the what is.Stellar is there any plan in the market.In for more like standardized or like I.Guess a better arrangement for companies.Such as ours or even though the.Developers who actually are attending.Events or want arrange events to sort of.Promote Stellar with official support.From the SDF yeah I mean that's part of.The marketing piece it's also just part.Of the questions that we need to ask.Ourselves at SDF and ask all of you as I.Just mentioned why build on Stellar it's.Different for every different like a use.Case it's different as to the why there.Are some things that are consistent you.Know the speed the security the.Scalability all those things are.Consistent but we need to figure out.Like what is the use kit why does it.Work for your use case and we need to.Promote that and so get people talking.About that so that is part of the work.Of our chief marketing officer that we.Just hired super happy he actually just.We closed the hire on Saturday and he is.Going to start on Wednesday so we'll.Have a lot of focus on that and and.We'll have it in materials that you that.Everyone can use it's not secret to us.This is like beneficial for the.Ecosystem at large so we want to help.You with that.I guess ah could you tell us a little.Bit more how does the regulatory.Thinking fit into some of the roadmap.And the plans for for Stellar.Interstellar I would be curious to hear.A little bit more about some of the.Potential hurdles did you foresee and.What are you doing to to address those.So I'll start and Judd can jump in on.This like from the standpoint of.Regulatory like part of the hurdle that.We have is that we actually haven't done.The best job of it before when we go and.We've spent I think we've gone to DC now.Since I've been here I think four times.Three or four times and when we do and.We talk to policymakers and regulators.And this is just in DC and we need to.Actually make this global because it's.Not just this government that's.Important in the United States it's.Actually other governments that are.Equally important but when we do and we.Talk to them about Stellar and the.Differences and just even the structural.Difference between what SDF is and then.What Stellar is and what Stellar does.It's kind of like a light bulb to them.Because it's unique one of the things.That I learned when I was at Mozilla.That was really important is that when I.Would talk to regulators and I spent a.Lot of my career doing that and.Policymakers it was from the standpoint.Of an entity that cared not just about.Its own products but an entity that.Cared about the ecosystem at large so.The web and by the way we also were.Building a consumer product in the.Market and so it was helpful from the.Regulatory bodies for them to understand.That we have a very similar look and.Feel here we are a non-profit we have.The notion of not just like the success.Of SDF because frankly SDF would be.Nothing if Stellar wasn't successful and.So we have the focus on what Stellar is.Which is all of you and so I think that.We have an opportunity to get through.The first regulatory hurdle which is the.Education piece because as I said and.Just a little bit ago like I feel like.So much of this is about blockchain and.The resistance to it is it because of.History and a little bit because of fear.Of the word blockchain and then that.Cryptocurrency word gets thrown in there.And everybody just doesn't know what to.Do and so I think that it's these kinds.Of things that we need to talk through.Like the truth of the matter is the.Network layer doesn't have to be.Regulated and shouldn't it's very much.Like the Internet and all of the.Entities that touch via are already.Regulated and so we shouldn't have a lot.Of regulatory hurdles but.The focus on consumer protection for.Regulators not just in the US but.Outside and every other country is a big.One and we need to tell them why that's.Okay why consumers are going to be okay.And we need to show that to them so one.Of the things that we pointed to in the.Pillars is for us to focus on to be the.Blockchain people know and trust and.That trust mechanism comes from also.Getting governments to understand that.We can be trusted also this network can.Be trusted in the people that build on.It have opportunity to be able to create.That trust with their consumers so I.Feel like their hurdles but we can.Achieve them we can overcome them and.Then of course there's like regulation.And we just need to focus on the right.Regulation and really advocate for the.Good parts and explain why the bad parts.Don't work so kind of a different kind a.Different kind of question.I would ask you if you could do you.Consider yourself as being an.Environmentally friendly and responsible.Enterprise because of the fact that.You're doing something using a.Technology that an algorithm that is not.As power consuming as Bitcoin or other.Technologies yeah I mean I kind of think.About that inverse where like the.Default is to not you know burn you know.Tons and tons of coal or whatever kind.Of power needs to power the thing but.Yeah so I but we're definitely have way.Less environmental impact than something.That requires mining.I can't see.Okay.Now.I can't see like way up there.This whole place is male-dominated if.You're looking to do more marketing if.You're targeting mass adoption.You are missing half of the population.And how do you address the issue in a.Blocking space this is not just Stella.Conference this is just everywhere in.Blockchain obviously and maybe I don't.Have to say this obviously something.That's near and dear to my heart and.It's not just in blockchain it's.Actually in tech generally so I've.Experienced it for most of my career.So I'll just say at the SDF we're hyper.Focused on inclusiveness not just from a.Gender standpoint but from lots of.Different ways that we think about being.Inclusive and so we focused our hiring.That way I think that we would love to.See more gender equality in this space.That's a lot of work that you guys need.To do she's right you look around here.Not as many women as we would like to.See we need to get that to be higher.We're gonna do our part to do that by.Supporting all companies not companies.That are just created and developed by.Men but companies that are created and.Developed by women and every other kind.Of diversity that you can think of so.That's our part but I think it's a I.Think it's a request to all of you to do.The same and I think that in order to.Make this whole ecosystem better you do.Have to think representative of all the.Different players out there that are.Your ultimate consumers in the space and.I gotta say women are an awful lot of.Them so it's work that we can do.Collectively and we need to spend the.Time and effort to do that and we're.Gonna do it so I'm committed to that.Ourselves.All right thanks everyone.Alright alright thanks so much everybody.It's given us a lot to talk about over.Some drinks which you will find where.You had lunch thank you guys so much for.A very successful day one at Meridian.And I had a great time with networking.And drinks.
