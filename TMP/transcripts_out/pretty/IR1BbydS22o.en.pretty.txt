Hello hello hello everyone.My name is tyler van der hoeven and I am.Very excited.To be presenting on another.Engineering talk.Today we're going to be going through.Stellar quest.This is a new app that I'm very very.Excited about before we get started.Though.A couple of little housekeeping items as.You all have questions.As we're going through today's talk you.Can either scan the qr code here.On the screen to ask questions or just.Pop them into.Into the youtube chat we'll try and get.To questions so as you have questions.For me.Be sure and pop them in there we'll have.A time for a q a.At the end .And then we're just gonna kind of.Walk through this this application.So it's been exactly a month actually so. right on the heels of the big release.Of scf 2.0.There's been this long-standing project.That i've wanted to build. kind of filling in the gap between.What I would call.Normie devs you know just developers.That may not be familiar with.Cryptocurrency or have been very wary of.Jumping in or.Even a lot of friends that i've had from. past jobs. wanting to introduce them to.Cryptocurrency but having a bit of a gap.Like where where do I get them started.Where do I sort of plant them I can't.Just send them documentation I want to.Give them a nice landing pad.For Stellar so there's kind of in this.Gap here between the normie devs.Developers that.Are good and enjoy what they do but are.Not familiar with cryptocurrency or.Stellar and have maybe wanted to or.Would be interested but need a good.Landing place a good onboarding. technical onboarding into.Interstellar kind of away from all of.The.You know win moon conversations and.Pricing and stuff but just want the.Technology like help me understand.From a technical perspective what's.Going on with these apps so that is.Stellar quest it's this.This this stepping stone between.Things like the scf.And kind of being deeper into the.Technology and somebody who really knows.Nothing. about cryptocurrency or the.Technology that powers it.So this is a very technical focused.Challenge it's a gamified. application that i've built so.Right after scf I started working on.Stellar quest so this has been a.Solo project that i've been working on.Over the past month.And since this is an engineering talk i.Think it's worth pointing out because.It's interesting and it's super.Interesting to me. it's all built on cloudflare worker.Technology I'm kind of a.Aws lambda I love serverless technology.But really wanted to try.Cloudflare workers so all the back end.Is built on top of cloudflare workers.Their serverless architecture as well as.Their key value pair.Storage and then the front end is.Stencil js.Hosted on versal so for those of you who.Are interested.In that sort of thing I think it's.Fascinating I really enjoyed working.With those.Tech I love stencil js and cloudflare.Workers was a real joy to work with.Definitely looking forward to using that.Moving forward I don't have a fancy.Slide deck.I will call out this one real fast.Just as you find these things.Interesting or want to keep up with.Projects that I'm working on be sure and.Follow me tyvdh.On twitter and again I'm the ecosystem.Evangelist at the.Stellar development foundation I don't.Have a big slide deck.We're going to actually be looking at.The application itself I'm going to walk.Through.The app that i've built and how to use.It so you'll get a little bit of a sneak.Peek this is a.This is a challenge application so for.Those of you who are lucky enough to.Tune in. you might get a little sneak peek at.What we have coming with the with the.Upcoming.First Stellar quest challenge so I'm.Gonna go ahead and switch.I am going to unfortunately have to call.Out one of our third-party services run.Kit.Is within the last 20 minutes actually.Is is.Experiencing a pretty major outage so.Some of our images.As well as challenge checking isn't.Working right now so.If you see some broken images or we.Encounter some unexpected errors.It's probably related to the run kit.Outage but that's unfortunate hopefully.It won't.Won't affect us too much unless of.Course it's cloudflare that's.Having the outage but I think it's just.Run kit so.Stellar quest this is our landing page.At the moment.Calling out a little bit about what it.Is some of this is up. for discussion definitely looking.For feedback and you guys are getting a.Bit of a.Sneak peek a first look at what we have.So far so as you have questions or.Comments or. kind of the dedicated Stellar fans be.Sure and reach out with any feedback or.Ideas for how to improve these.Screens or the commentary that we have.But you can see right away that series 1.Of Stellar quest will be launching on.Monday.So challenge 1 of series 1 is going live.At 9 00 a.m.This coming monday so mark your.Calendars. there are xlm prizes as well as.These fantastic fancy badges which .You can't see right now because again.We're using run kit to.Render some of those so .Until run kits back up those will be.Dead images unfortunately. for those of you again who is.Engineering talk so these are.Badges so we've got excellent prizes.That are kind of a while supplies last.Sort of thing is you can you know the.First few people that complete each.Challenge.Will be eligible for xlm prizes.And then anybody who completes a.Challenge will get one of these badges.So there's eight badges there are eight.Challenges.Whenever you complete a challenge you.Unlock one of these badges.So it's kind of like the collectibles.That you you'll have on your Stellar.Account as you complete.Challenges so these are not kind of.One after the next.The the first one launches on monday and.Then we wait.Until friday at 9 00 pm we've got a.m.And p.m to make sure we cover everybody..Across the globe eight challenges.First one launches on on monday so very.Very excited for this to.For this to go live be sure and.Mark your calendars and then as you.Have people that have been interested in.Stuller maybe you've been wanting to.Onboard your developer friends into what.We're doing here.Be sure and send them the link which.Will be quest.Stellar.org.Quest.Stellar.org I'm not sure I include.That in any slides so.I'll make sure and call that out so.Let's go ahead and log in so.Got some legal stuff we've got my super.Secret dev login number.We're using SMS codes. to protect against civil attacks. where one person can pretend to be.Many people if we use social or email.It's very easy to duplicate those and.Just continuously log yourself.In complete challenges and thereby claim.All of the prizes as a single entity.So by using SMS and only allowing actual.Mobile numbers. you know no no voice over ip numbers.Or landlines.Just mobile numbers connected to a valid.Network.We block against a lot of that so that's.Why if you're confused why we're using.Sms numbers that's what we're using for.Now to protect against.The that's the anti-sybil mechanisms.That we're using.Same thing that we're using with the .Community fund.Verify that code and this will jump us.To challenge number one now I'm going to.Give you a sneak peek of challenge one.I'm going to try my best not to click on.Any other challenges so that.You don't get too far ahead of us the.Challenge number one here is just.Creating an account so these challenges.Are all very modular and relatively.Simple. if you're brand new to seller these.Might be like whoa what in the world is.This but.We've got helpful links brief brief.Commentary on what you're trying to do.Again these are challenges for prizes so.We don't want to give away too much but.The idea here is to give away enough.Information that .People know where to go to complete the.Challenge as well as not to lose them.Along the way so.We'll kind of test and see where we can.Make improvements.To kind of have that good balance.Between giving away too much and not.Giving away enough to keep the incentive.To continue on with the challenges but. so we've logged in.We've got our first challenge all the.Challenges will be completed with the.Same.Testnet account so this right here is.Just the the account seed.Or the account public key and you need.To fund this account you can't.Directly fund it with with .Friendbot you're going to have to figure.Out a way to do it probably through.Friendbot through another account or.Something like that hinted. but these these accounts will all be.Done.Using the testnet this entire series.Still requests will be divided into.Different series.The first series is the one that we're.Launching now it's comprised of.Eight different challenges and these.Series will launch. who knows you know maybe we'll do.Some partnerships with other.Dev groups or just continue to launch.These from.The foundation I would love to see.Partnerships happen where there's lots.Of different series that are co-branded.With other entities. and for each one of those you'll get.A different public key that kind of.Links up to.The different challenges and complete.Them all through there when we actually.Get to the claiming prize portion.That's when you're going to connect a.Public key on the live network.Where you can claim prizes and actually.Have all your stuff on the live network.But.For the actual challenges everything's.On test net so you're not gonna have to.Spend any money or go through coinbase.Or somehow figure out how to get lumens.The idea again is is just to understand.The technology behind.Behind Stellar i've got a nice discord.Channel if you guys want to join that.Once it's live we'll have some different.Discussion going on there as well as if.Anybody has.Problems or issues we'll try and build.Up a little community to support each.Other.There's another thing I think worth.Calling out on the login there's a.Couple we're using.The twilio lookup service.And there are some issues with different.Countries or regions.Around SMS verification so if you're.Pretty sure that your number should work.Particularly like if you're using a.Voiceover ip number but that's your main.Number or that's what you're using to.Get around issues that you have with.Your network.But it's not letting you in you would.Jump into the discord channel. there's a there's a channel there for.Help login.That we can we can white list your.Number to let you in.Even if you're using a voice over ip.Number or or in a country that.Twilio doesn't support but you're.Still an individual single human being. so that's worth calling out if.You're having issues. logging in there is some some help.For that in general though it should.Work fine. so I'm assuming these these check.Buttons. trigger off on run kit they actually.Look at run kit to see.If your account has performed the action.That is required.So I'm guessing that these buttons will.Yes throw some errors because run kit is.Done right now.If you just can't figure it out and you.Want to just move on and kind of forfeit.The the cash prize but are still wanting.To get the the token.You can click the the shrug button here.I don't know .And it'll actually pop up a block of.Code straight from run kit.Which you can run it'll have.Pre-populated in there your public and.Private keys.So that when you when you actually go to.Run that code it will.Perform all the actions necessary to get.Your account to a passing state.To where you could then check it and.Pass the pass the challenge again you.Wouldn't get the xlm you wouldn't be.Eligible for the xlm prizes. but you could still be eligible for.The for the badge for completing the.Challenge and i'll let you move on.To the next challenge so if you ever get.Stuck and you.Really just can't figure it out and you.Don't feel like jumping into discord or.Asking for help which I really strongly.Suggest that you do you know try and get.Through it it's the whole point but for.Some reason it's really stuck.You can always just shrug out of it and.And then run the code that that will.Spit out.And then check it again and it should.Let you pass. once you've completed challenges.However and you're moving right along. every so often we run a.Check on the back end which compiles all.Of the.People who have completed the challenge.And it runs them against. it kind of compiles all those.Together runs them against our prize.Array.To see who gets what based on when you.Completed the challenge and then it.Generates.Basically an id which serves as a.Claimable. prize so in this case.I've got one waiting here for challenge.One.And it looks like I got first place in.This lucky me. local hosts you know not the most.Popular domain name at the moment for.Everybody else to join so. I won first place got 500 lumens for.Challenge one.See again this beautiful badge here.And now I have the ability to claim this.And so this is going to trigger.The the functionality to allow me to.Actually connect to.Or create or connect to a public account.Public key.Where a public network key rather and. actually put this this badge and.500 lumens into my account we do put.A nice little call out here that's .Notifying that we're using albedo .Orbital lenses. he's the guy who built Stellar.Expert developer.Good team they built albedo which is.Kind of.It's a it's a plug-in but it's also just.A pop-up service that's a.Very low friction relatively low.Friction .Crypto wallet account that you can use.Straight from.A browser both on mobile desktop safari. any browser will do and that's what.We're using to.Communicate between this website and the.Wallet so our non-custodial.Application that we'll be calling.This account kind of building that.Relationship between making sure.Individuals are owning their own.Accounts and understanding what they're.Doing but also.Having the ease of access of.Communication between the browser and.The actual wallet so.I've got an account here that's been. connected it's right now it's on the.Test net but. recently merged away so we can we got.A little bit of activity on here but it.Actually doesn't exist right now.So the first thing it will do will be to.Create this account and then. claim those those balances and albedo.I'm using implicit very similar to oauth.Where you don't have to continuously.Enter your password every single time.You want to claim a prize so it's.Possible that i've actually got.A session variable looks like it I don't.Right now so it'll pop a session.Variable in there.When I run the implicit mode so when i.First click claim it should pop up that.Window.To allow me to actually connect.To that into the password and then that.Will go and claim that.Balance looks like again we have a run.Kit issue so it won't actually let me.Claim.This balance but the nice thing here is.It should have.Assuming that that error happened after.Yep we have that session.So if I go and claim this again it.Shouldn't do the pop-up it should just.Try.And claim that prize again because we.Have the run kit issue won't actually.Let us claim it but once that run kit.Issue is cleared. it'll it'll take this balance it'll.Go.And or i'll take this id go and see that. the public key that i've just sent.Along with.The amount and the badge it'll create a.Transaction for me then it'll send it.Back for me to sign.The implicit albedo session will.Sign that transaction and then actually.Send it back to.Stellar quest backend and then the.Stutter quest backend is actually going.To wrap that whole signed.Transaction in a fee bump transaction.So that your users or I guess sell.Request users never have to pay.Fees themselves i'll be consuming all of.The fees.But I still get the really high.Throughput so if a lot of people are.Claiming.Prizes at the same time I don't have to.Worry about the sequence number because.User accounts are consuming sequence.Numbers but.My fee account is consuming all of the.So a nice use case there of the fee bump.That recently came out in protocol 13. allows for a little bit higher.Throughput.For claiming these prizes without having.To have users.Actually pay the fees to to collect.Their prizes.So really honestly that's that's kind of.It .These these challenges will come out.Every monday and friday.Again if we look back at our schedule.You can see.Mondays and fridays 9 a.m and 9 p.m.Going from.Challenges one and two for four weeks.All the way through to november six.We'll be calling out things like.Meridian hackathon which is open and.Ready for registration as well as.Things like the Stellar community fund.Particularly the lab fund so if folks.Are.Enjoying Stellar quests and really.Getting into the challenges there's.Places for them to go.Once we again i'd really like to have .Partnerships with other developer groups. there might be opportunities for.Co-branded links and.Really starting to open up the.Stellar sphere.To people that are not inside crypto.That's kind of the whole point of.Stellar quest is to really aim at.Normie dead steps that have not been.Involved.In crypto before but are interested or.At least willing to take a try so long.As it's kind of that low barrier.Gamified entry level experience which.Is what we're trying to achieve again.With.With Stellar quests so with that.We will open it up for for questions.Does anybody have.Questions about Stellar quest.I'll just wait we've got our.Our onca team looking through if there's.Any questions if there aren't.You know if I explain everything so well.Of course there are no questions.We'll wait a few minutes and see if.Anybody has anything to ask.So one question you all should be asking.Is why do we have to wait.Why can't we just claim prizes as soon.As. we finish a challenge why do you have.To put it into a queue.That's an excellent question glad you.Asked it it has to do with.The fact that I'm real I really tried to.Use cloudflare.Exclusively for the back end so we're.Actually using their key value.Storage database if you will but it has.A potential.Latency of one minute so you can imagine.If people are completing challenges.In one.Part of the world and people are.Completing challenges in another part of.The world if that's not in sync.I could complete a challenge after you.Claim the prize before you.And so that's not that's no good so we.Have to wait until that potential.Latency has passed.To allow everybody to claim the prize.That they actually won. by looking at time stamps once.Cloudflare actually announced last week.A more real-time synced .They called durable objects I think it's.In beta right now so once it.Once it reaches a stable release that'll.Allow us to do.Claims in real time so we won't have.That kind of.Intermittent waiting period between.Completing a challenge and claiming the.Price for it you'll know immediately as.Soon as you finish it.What place you got and whether or not.You have xlm prize associated with it so.Excellent question next.Another another good one interesting one.Not really a question but something.That'll be quite fascinating is once.Protocol 13.I'm sorry protocol wait 14 goes live. I think it's 13.I think the last one.Was 12.I'm a seller person I can actually.Remember goes live with claimable.Balances and sponsor reserves the whole.Process of claiming the prizes will be.Much easier.One of the issues right now with.Claiming prizes is it's a badge so it's.A custom.Asset that's stored on the blockchain.Which means I have to open up a truss.Line.For it and so the there's a very real.Time. opening up a truss line and issuing.An asset that happens. where I have to kind of just sit.There and wait until.You're immediately asking like hey I'm.Ready to receive this prize.Once claimable balances exist I can just.Say oh this person won this prize I'm.Going to set up.An entry in in Stellar that says.Here's the prize for this public key and.It's out here.Which will allow you to claim it at any.Point in time from any. any place you have access to that.Public key so rather than having to sort.Of have me and you both.There at the same time to both ask for.Create the transaction for and then.Receive the prize those things can.Happen asynchronously.Which will make the prize claiming.Process much easier as well as.You know if you claim the prize or you.You're eligible for the prize but.For some reason you decide not to claim.It I can.Leave myself as a claimant on that.Claimable balance and say after.One day or after a week if you don't.Claim it I'm going to revoke it and put.That prize back into the pool for.Somebody else to grab.So very excited about claimable balances.And then obviously sponsor reserves.Will be really nice because right now.I'm actually creating accounts for.People as they come in.And are attempting to claim their prizes.If their account.Doesn't exist on the ledger yet I put.Down.The the minimum balance.For the account for it to exist as well.As covering any. any fees for.The assets that they're trusting so each.Of the badges.Has a 0.5 lumen reserve that's required.For.For you to hold that asset so I give.You all those lumens right now into your.Account it'll be really nice once we.Have sponsor reserves where I can just.Sponsor those.For you rather than actually giving them.To you.So both of those new features coming out.To the next protocol release.Will be amazing and will greatly improve.That along with the durable objects from.Cloudflare will make.Stellar quests just a little bit faster.And honestly easier to to manage from my.End on the on the Stellar side so.Very excited about those it's been.Interesting actually building a.Production level.Application on top of Stellar so it's.Like a meta application where you're.Both teaching.People about Stellar but also using it.To teach them. through the badges and the prizes and.Actually trying to get all these things.To work well where it's.A very high friction to try and game it.But it also is really low friction if.You're just trying to use it.It's a lot of fun it's quite challenging.To build an application like this.Where it actually works but it's been a.Ton of fun super excited to see what the.Future.Of it holds again as you have feedback. be sure and leave it go through these.Challenges the first one.On the public network is launching .This this next monday so.All right if there are no questions.Thank you all for for.Watching this has been a lot of fun.Looking forward to to actually launching.This.Live make sure again mark calendars get.Out there. and good luck.Good luck bye.
