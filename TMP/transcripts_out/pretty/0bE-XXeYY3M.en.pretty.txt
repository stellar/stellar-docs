Hello everyone and welcome to the.Stellar open protocol discussion. so for those of you who are watching.Just a quick reminder the goal of these.Meetings is to talk about and plan for.Changes to upcoming versions of the.Stellar protocol and so we go over.Core advancement proposals or caps .These are open source specs they.Describe new features designed to evolve.The protocol.To meet ecosystem needs so caps go.Through a rigorous process before.They're actually implemented in Stellar.Core and then put forward for a.Validator vote. in in a new protocol version and so.Before the network upgrades.Validators they have to agree to accept.That new version of the protocol that.Actually.Includes the implemented change this.Meeting is just a part of that process.Right it's where people raise questions.And dig into technical details and work.Together to think through proposals and.We're definitely we're broadcasting it.So that you can all everyone out there.Can see the gears turning but I also.Want to say there's a complimentary.Asynchronous discussion on the Stellar.Dev mailing list.And we encourage anyone who has thoughts.About changes to the protocol to join.That mailing list and participate in the.Discussion. there's a link to it in the event.Description I'm going to talk about more.In a second.But first I just want to say last.Meeting we started talking about two.Similar proposals.Cap 37 and CAP 38 both of which suggest.A method to introduce automated market.Makers at the protocol levels.So automated market makers amms they.Allow the creation of liquidity pools.Which are simple and non-interactive.And which can attract large amounts of.Capital and enable high volumes of.Trading. so they're so they're a simple way to.Provide the liquidity that's necessary.For asset exchange.And that's the goal here right to.Implement the change to the Stellar.Protocol.Aimed at improving overall network.Liquidity so.Today we're going to continue the.Discussion about amms that kicked off.About a month ago on the Stellar dev.Mailing list.This is a technical discussion so if you.Want to follow along I suggest reading.The caps both of them.And the recent developer mailing list.Threads about them which are linked to.In the event description.So one thing I just want to mention real.Quick is that this morning OrbitLens.Who is the author of top 37 and who.Unfortunately can't be here today i.Don't think. he did raise some issues about the.Ongoing amen discussion in a blog post.And there's a lot there I don't think.Anyone here has had a chance to fully.Process it quite yet.But I imagine that people will have.Thoughts and what makes sense to me is.To discuss the points he raises on that.Stellar dev google group I mentioned.Earlier.That way we can sort of discuss things.In a public forum that's set up for.Participation rather than.Trading blogs back and forth the key.Point we are currently discussing these.Ideas.We haven't settled on the best.Implementations for bringing amunds to.Stuller.And we'd really love to hear the.Concerns folks have on the mailing list.Where we're working together to find the.Design that serves users.So here's where we are right now okay.The last meeting we talked about.A few things mostly in the context of.Cap 38 we talked about liquidity pool.Reserve requirements.The relationship between the decks and.Amms whether to allow pool parameters to.Be updated.And whether or not to support multiple.Pools for the same asset pair.Now there are still open questions about.All those things right an ongoing.Again on that Stellar dev mailing list. but today we're actually going to.Focus on something a little different.It's another question.That needs to be answered by any amm.Design basically asset authorization and.Revocation.How that fits into amms so siddharth.In the CAP 38 thread you suggested two.Different models for handling.Handling authorization and replication.And I'm just wondering if to start us.Off you can sort of.Walk through that those two models.Briefly and kind of outline the pros and.Cons of each.Yeah of course yeah so i'll go over.Two approaches for authorication.And forcing a redeem of the pool shares.Back to the owner. so in the first approach revoking.Authorization.On either an asset trust line.Will redeem all pool shares that that.Trust line astrus line.Has a balance in so this will also.Require us to first make sure that acid.Trust lines cannot be deleted while they.Have a balance in the pool.And we'll make the data layer more.Complex with additional queries and.Indexes for the lookup.Because we have to look up all the pull.Trust lines and pools.The good thing about this approach is.That it works like author revocation.With offers.So no additional steps are required when.An issuer issuer.Is regulating a specific asset the.Second approach.Is a little different the way it works.Is that an issue where an asset can.In a pool can revoke off on the pull.Trust line instead of the asset trust.Line to redeem shares held by the pool.Trust.Line so any any issuer. of any of the assets in a pool can do.This.And then once that happens the the.Pool shares held by that pool trust sign.Will be redeemed back to the owner.This approach will require the issuer to.Look up all pool trust lines that I want.To revoke off from. which isn't that big of a deal but.The bigger issue we we.Wanted to address is that the issuer.Will also need to be aware of the.Additional step during authorication.Because now that not only do you have to.Revoke off in the asset trust line but.You may need to be.You may need to broke off from the pull.Trust line so john had an idea here.To require the issuer to opt in. to liquidity pools so once using.An.Authorization flag on the using the.Account flag.So once that happens then the issuer.Should be aware of nuances related to.Liquidity pools.The nice thing about this approach is.That it's simple to implement doesn't.Require changes in the data layer. the current cat38 proposal takes the.Second approach but we should.Obviously get some thoughts on this and.See if.If that's what we want to finalize on.One thing i'll tack on to what's it.Earth side is an idea from.Nikola that perhaps this opt-in behavior.For for liquidity pool should only apply.To the assets that are.Already authorization required this.Was also discussed on the mailing list.But I think this is an.Interesting an interesting addition.Because you know.If you're not off required then there's.No concerns about revoking stuff anyway.Really. and in that kind of a setting.I think the majority of the assets on.The network are not authorization.Required and so.Most things would just kind of.Transition seamlessly.Which I think is a cool advantage but i.Think there are some pros and cons to.That.I mean is it worth just outlining the.Pros and cons to that. I mean I think the major con is that.It's just.More complicated like when you're trying.To figure out.What's gonna what's gonna happen.Basically it's like okay I have to look.At this flag but I also have to pair it.Up against this other flag.And I think that's kind of the major.Thing like oh you know I'm looking at.Some asset can i.Can I put it in a liquidity pool it's.Not as obvious in that case. so I think that that's probably.The biggest.Drawback of that kind of an additional.Step and I think lee was trying to say.Something a second ago so I'm gonna let.Him jump in.Yeah sorry I wasn't I was muted. how would it work if you.If the asset was not auth required but.Then the issuer decided to enable.Author required.In terms of the ability to participate.In pools so like when adding auth.Required would the.Issuer need to also indicate that the.Asset can continue to be used in pools. it's an open question that I hadn't.Even considered yet.So it's a it's a good question I think.That that's another aspect of the.Complexity.Of all of this here ideally the way i.Would kind of.Like it to work is that you these.These things kind of work like. like what's it called the same way.That auth required works today which is.That as i've said many times the name is.Very .Very kind of misleading and it's really.More like what's your default.Authorization state. and the liquidity pools thing could.Work the same kind of way where it's.Like what's the default authorization.State for a newly created pool share.Trust line.And so then it could be like the default.State is equal to.The or of is this flag explicitly set.And the not of auth required.Yeah I think where the reason I ask it.Is because I think like we're trying to.We're talking about adding that to make.It less of a foot gun.For people to for issues.To not have to know about how liquidity.Pools work.If they're already off required but then.The flip is true the flip side.Is that for an asset that's not all.Required. and that issue doesn't know about.Liquidity pools if they suddenly.Make it was required.Then they need to know about that flag. if yeah if they're already allowing.Liquidity pools to use.So do we have any assets that are .That are auth immutable but not auth.Required because if so it seems like.You'll be kind of unfortunate if you.Couldn't use those in amms.No they see nobody does that.Nobody says I promise I'm not going to.Revoke this asset I'm going to make it.Off immutable.Because that seems like the primary.Point of off immutable is to like.Promise that you're not going to.Suddenly turn on off.The required flag right I mean like we.Have.The like to me the we and I think i.Mentioned that on the main english the.Degenerate case of this is actually the. xlm right it's basically a.Are not required immutable so I think.In my mind it has to work the same way.Right for accident this is what this you.Know .You know this type of assets and those.Type of assets I think we want. to have them on the network they are.Basically like the.The purest from a.You know crypto asset point of view.Tomer it's my understanding that like.The auth immutable flag in general is.Just like not highly used.Perhaps not really anybody is using it.At all under any circumstances. what what's kind of the actual status.Of that right now.Yeah that's correct the author immutable.Flag is almost .Not used at all I think maybe one issue.Where I need to look that up.But usually when issuers want to.Make a statement about the asset being.Locked down they actually do .The remove signature way to be something.Not achievable.So actually my comment would apply to.That case too if anybody sort of.Created non-author required assets and.Like you know. nuked the signing weights on the.Issuing account.It would be a bummer if those assets.Couldn't work with the amm.If I would probably want it.You know a default on thing unless the.There are no such assets.So so the so the question is.Like do we expect such assets to exist.And .You know nico said something very smart.Which is like this is like the crypto.Asset in its purest form right. but to some extent it's.It's somewhat of a myth and if you.Look at.You know if you look at a lot of popular.Tokens in like the erc20 universe.There there is almost no such thing as.An immutable.Asset anymore like all our erc 20.Contracts are actually proxies so that.They could be upgraded if .You know and if you discover like.Malicious. you know backdoors or whatever so.You know there's almost always some sort.Of you know oversight it might be some.Some you know consortia via multisig.Or something like that but.It's very rare to have you know.Almost non-existent to have like assets.In it like the pure. you know untouchable form.And so I guess the other sort of.Question about the current state of the.Ecosystem is let's say that we. we kind of flip the polarity such.That there's a flag that's off by.Default but you could just.As an issuer said it it says like don't.Use this in mms or something right. do we think that there are any people.Out there who.Like they have an asset that they really.Care that it's not used in an amm but.They sort of lack the confidence to.Or awareness to set such a flag if we.Give them like you know.A month's notice or something.I can't think of such assets because i.Feel like I wouldn't I want this.You know of course we want the mm to be.Usable as widely as possible.And we also want to be in a position.Where like we don't have people sort of.Bitterly complaining that we pulled the.Rug out from under them but. but beyond that .You know so to me that suggests we want.Some kind of like the.Default on thing basically.I mean tomer from the perspective of.Like what if we.So like the motivation for adding this.Kind of.A flag in the first place it kind of.Originated from this notion of like.What about people who who wrote some.Code.And have something running on their back.End and it's you know issuing assets and.Receiving.Requests to revoke them and whatever .And.These guys they don't realize that.Something has changed out from.Underneath them and.You know people start putting stuff into.Liquidity pools they revoke.But it doesn't actually really do the.Job because those assets.Are still in the liquidity pool they're.Still being traded .Do you think anybody would even care.Because if nobody cares and nobody would.Really be in this situation like this.Isn't a problem for.It doesn't matter if this situation.Might arise a year in the future if you.Show up a year in the future.And you start doing something well i.Expect you to know what the current.State of what you're doing is.It's only for people who already have.Operations and if you don't think any of.Those people would care.Then maybe we don't have to jump through.Any of these hoops at all.So I think both the both this edge case.And the edge case that. like david brought up are.Very edgy like they're just not.I'm having a hard time thinking about.Anyone that will actually be affected.By this in the ecosystem I think that .You know if we would have asked a lot of.Assets like that in the ecosystem then i.Would say that david's. kind of like on by default would.Would make. sense because they would probably.Want to participate in these liquidity.Pools. but then we'd have we'd have a.Problem with the mechanics of.Of how to revoke change and and kind.Of like.You know and your point comes into play.In reality I just don't think it matters.All that much I think.I think I think what you suggest john is.Probably.More complete in that if anyone is.Relying on existing behavior they don't. they don't get borked when you.Know when they try to revoke. you know like a new asset.You know liquidity cool stuff.Yeah I just don't think it matters all.That much like I vote for for what you.Said john. for you know having an off.By default so that people know that.There's like.A special handling required.Yes required or not just.Like in general because I think that's.Kind of one of the distinctions we are.Trying to.To draw in the in the conversation was.For auth required assets you do want.It off by default but the ones that are.Not.Earth required can be on by default.That if we if we had it on by default.That like there's probably nobody who.Would.Mind right that's what I was confused.About too like.Turmeric can you clarify actually like.Are you saying that we should.Remove the flag because you don't think.Anybody would actually want the flag.To be set or are you saying that we.Should do.One of the things that either I was.Suggesting david was suggesting any of.Us were suggesting I'm a little confused.So I thought we were discussing a.Dedicated flag.That is on by default or sorry off by.Default for .For author required assets.Yeah so I was I was supporting that.So in other words if you have an off.Required asset you have to.Designate it you have to flip the flag.To say.This auth required asset is now can now.Be used in liquidity equals.Yeah that is indeed what I agreed with.Yeah.The opt-in yeah.I think david that that would cover your.Case too because if you're.Auth required you need to have at least.Oh.No you could just have low signing.Weight only.I guess it also depends yeah if you can.You set this flag with low signing.Weight. I mean I guess.I'd rather .I you know i'd rather stuff be on by.Default right for the same reason like.Auth required isn't the default.You know I would like it if inhibit amm.Weren't.Or whatever require a mm off.Weren't on by default for for anyone. just.It's just it's very easy to convince.Ourselves that there's edge cases where.Like.Somebody is not somebody is like.Not gonna be paying attention and and.It's going to run into huge problems but.You know if these are edge cases then.I'd rather.Just have the functionality on by.Default.It also simplifies the logic you know a.Tiny bit.Like and it gives more possibilities you.Know maybe there actually is.Some asset that you like really don't.Want to have used in an amm for some.Reason but you don't want to.Auth require it.So correct me if I'm wrong but if they.Do have auth required right now.Then and we turn it on by default.Then.The authorization semantics is.Understood by the issuer.Essentially get like invalid or.Changed.Right oh I see so you're suggesting like.A big database migration on the protocol.Upgrade which actually is another thing.We can just kind of like.It's a it's an it's an inhibit flag.That's going to be off by default but.For starters we grew.Everybody who's currently author.Required we actually set the flag when.We introduce it.Is that is that what you're I wasn't.Thinking about that.But and in that situation if someone.Showed up.New to issue a new asset.It would be and they decided to make it.Auth required.It would automatically be on it would be.No they'd have to decide like the same.Way auth required is off by default the.Amm inhibit flag is going to be off by.And so when you set one you might or.Might not want to set the other these.Are like you know it's part of your.Decision tree it's the same as you have.To decide whether you want to set auth.Immutable which you know most people.Don't.But or like auth clawback or whatever.Like we're just going to have.When you want to issue an asset like.These are the decisions that you need to.Make about your asset.And so if we kind of you know clearly.Document that you have to make like.Three different decisions about what.Your assets can behave like.Then I feel fine going forward and it's.Just a question of do we have like.Existing assets.Where like people are.Like would not have the confidence or.Awareness that they need to like change.This flag if they care about it and then.You know like a month after we announced.This and the thing goes live then it.Would run into problems.Can I flip this discussion over for a.Second now and say like. these problems don't really exist as.Much if we.Were really at all if we did the other.Authorization model that like.The version one that starts listed .Which is basically like make it work.Exactly like offers work today.You get your auth revoked now your now.Your pool shares are all going to get.Revoked too.Obviously this has some like.Implementation burden on our side. it would make us have more things to.Test and whatever.But if it's justified then maybe we.Should consider that.But that's not sort of that's not.Semantically equivalent.So the the question is I i.Actually see these things as almost.Orthogonal like there's two different.Things like one is like what happens.When like you know particular people.Get sanctioned or whatever and.Another question is.Do you not want there to be you know.Do you want a tighter like control of.Like the market in your asset.And they seem like different questions.And I could imagine different.Asset issuers to answering different.Ways for the two questions.So john with with the v1 you described.Yeah does that mean we .Does that mean issuers do not have the.Ability to opt out of liquidity pools.We we could still add that feature if we.Wanted to but that feature would no.Longer be one of these kind of like.You could make this work and everything.Would kind of look transparent from an.Issuer's perspective.Like different things would be happening.On the network but the same operations.That they were doing to control accounts.Would all still work.So in in the version one approach i.Agree with david the questions are.Orthogonal like.How do we want to control like do like.You have this choice on how to control.The ah.You make a certain choice and then the.Other degree of freedom is totally open.But if you go the approach two then the.Then you're not in an orthogonal space.Anymore. because then you have this backwards.Compatibility problem that appears.But we could kind of answer the question.Separately like maybe we want the flag.Either way so then it matters a bit less.Yeah so I'm reading siddharth's .Outline here and I'm I'm.Leaning towards v1 in terms of .Like a more sensible contract that's in.Line with what we have today. I don't have you know you core folks.Need to. you know express how bad this is.In terms of implementation because i.Think from a contract perspective this.Just.You know is is more in line with what.You have today.It's like .It's it's variably bad I guess is the.Best way to characterize it.In a world where we only have two.Asset liquidity pools it's like probably.Not so bad.But like if we were in a world where we.Were like oh you know like balancer type.Pools with eight assets are actually.Great.Then it starts becoming kind of.Problematic .The reason it becomes kind of.Problematic is that we have to be able.To efficiently.Extract all the pool shares that have to.Get revoked.But they might correspond to any of the.Assets in the pool.Let's say there's eight just for the.Sake of argument maybe in pool one it's.The third asset and then in pool two.It's the seventh asset and full three.It's the first asset.So you end up breaking out all the.Assets into separate columns in your.Databases.You've got an index on every column.Right now our an average table in our.Database has either zero or one indices.So like for example if we were in this.World that would add you know.Eight times as many indices as I think.The trustline table currently has. so that's that's kind of the.Perspective here.There's probably big performance.Complications as soon as you add eight.Indices. you know every index operation is.Basically a table.Operation so .I mean to be fair you don't necessarily.Need to do.That many indexes like you can do it in.A in a way it's a little more.Like you know map asset to like a it's a.Multi-map.Basically like.Creating a separate table to query again.Yeah it's a separate table for indexing.Purely for indexing it's yeah.But it's it might be a lot more.Efficient than that might be more.Efficient.More complicated ones you because that's.One b one one b three right as opposed.To many b3s.Yeah so I mean like that could be a.Better implementation but then we have.To maintain an extra table. so yeah it might be more efficient.Probably more complicated.Look v1 makes more sense from a contact.Perspective i. is there someone that disagrees with.Okay I agree okay. so you know in that case you know. you know nico you folks need to put.Your foot down.On on whether this is like acceptable. or the complexity in core just .You know makes it so that we need to.Make the less.Sensible contract decision.Justin maybe we need to let the core.Folks huddle up and.And and and figure out like how yeah.I feel like that's true are there any.Other questions about this topic that we.Want to make sure to cover or.Or is that our stopping point core folks.Go back and think about.Whether the more sensible contract.Approach v1.Whether the implementation is a show.Stopper blocker.Or is there more is there more I guess.The only.The only question i'll still ask here is.Like do we still want the flag.Because like the like we could always.Add the flag later.If people want to opt out .And that that would just mean that we.Have less work to do and we can deliver.This sooner. oh I can I can reach out to some.Viewers. and and see if that's a.If that's a showstopper in any way .Intuitively I can't think of any issuer.That will. you know passionately want to.Disable their asset from participating.In liquidity pools. but I'm not sure.Is there like to the extent I would.Imagine people doing that I could.Imagine a situation where.What you really want is like you believe.That there's sort of like two or three.High quality assets that are kyc.And whatever and so you're willing and.You're you're willing to have your asset.Have a market against those and you.Don't want.Just like random people buying your.Asset where you can't sort of trace one.Hop and.And ask who that was so is there any.Possibility to add.To give issuers control over what assets.They're allowed to be.Matched we'd like to have a trust line.On.The liquidity pool itself as opposed to.An individual.Participant.That's an interesting concept my.Kind of a priori intuition on this.Is that you like you can't control that.Today anyway because.You could already do it against the.Decks like the existing order book.And if that's the kind of feature you.Wanted you're probably using the.The cap18 semantics .Which is for people listening it's like.This like fine grained authorization.Control and it's mapped up against some.Sep.Which number I can't remember right now..So I can't I can't really see how adding.This feature.At the protocol level would you're muted.David.You're still muted.None of us can hear you david sorry.There could be like you know a trade-off. required flag or something that.Basically it applies to both the mms and.The decks.And it says it says like I actually.Have to authorize.Any other asset that my asset is traded.Against.So making it apply even to the existing.Order bill yeah.I mean interesting if nobody's asking.For this then you know it's.Probably not worth doing but this.Actually seems more useful than just.Like blanket inhibiting.Amms it's definitely an interesting idea.Not one that i've heard before I think.Tomer can find out what people really.Want and that's probably the good.A good starting point but if you're.Gonna do that and it's retroactive onto.The existing order book i'd say let's do.It as a separate.A separate kind of proposal in a.Separate protocol version probably.Just for the sake of expedience but then.If if if we think that that.That actually solves people's problems.Better than the existing ones then maybe.We don't need to worry as much about.The existing ones you know unless.There's anybody saying like.You know don't don't let my don't let my.Asset be traded.In amms but do let it be traded on the.Decks like somebody yeah which is.Weird like it's hard for me to imagine.What that use case is but maybe it's.There I don't know.Yeah I think given that you know we.Don't have this feature around the decks.Right now and .You know we haven't had issuers saying.You know I'm not going to issue this.Asset because I'm afraid it's going to.Be.Traded on the decks ..You know I think we're probably in the.Same boat with liquidity pools.Okay maybe let's call today well I mean.In in fairness.There's probably people who say like I'm.Just not gonna issue my asset on a.Blockchain because it's because I'm.Scared of blockchains.And so this would be more like we could.Come to and say hey you've heard of.These two.Issuers who are like you know reputable.In the non-blockchain financial world.Well guess what like you could you could.Make your asset available only for.Like you know you know only for sale for.Like customers of like these two banks.Or whatever. and that would sort of it would be a.Way of kind of attracting people who are.Otherwise afraid of blockchain by.Making it less unknown.But again this would be I guess a.Separate proposal so.Right so back to this issue for this.Particular proposal.It seems like where where we've ended at.Least with today's discussion is.V1 makes more sense as a contract.But the question is what does the.Implementation.Look like in and that's something that.The core team will.Think about seems true right.Seems like where we've ended up okay i.Have a question about all three.It's not really to do with v1 versus v2.I think it applies to both of them. and it's from siddharth's email where.He .Presented these two different options it.Says an email that.If the full shares can't be sent back to.The owner.That is impossible that they're going to.Get stored in a claimable balance for.The owner is that something we're.Still considering.And if so .I'm just a little concerned it seemed.That seems like that would be very.Unpredictable.And applications like they may not.Really handle that edge case so.Yeah I'm just curious about that.So we're we're still thinking about how.How that case would work. like you know regards to claimable.Balances and.You know we initially considered all.Like always putting it into account.Clinical balance. but there there are still questions.Around.Like how reserves would work here and.Things like that so it's still open.We're still thinking about it.If you have an idea to how to avoid this.Problem.I'd be like super enthusiastic about it.I've had I think three calls of.Siddharth but we've like tried to think.About how you could avoid doing this. and we always run into some case.Which.Pretty much forces you to create a.Claimable balance as it stands today. but maybe there's some other thing we.Can constrain that we haven't figured.Out yet I'm super.Super open to ideas here.Lee does that answer your question more.Or less. yeah I think .I would like to understand what all the.Cases are where.The claim will balance would be required.I I can assume.I can maybe think of one but I'm not I'm.Not really sure if I certainly.Understand the problem.So some examples of some cases where you.Would require them.Just off the top of my head it's.Probably not going to be complete.But one case is you're in a pool share.And you've. you're in a liquidity pool and you've.Removed the trust lines for the.Corresponding.Assets so for example it's like I'm in.An .A usda usdb pool .But I don't have the trust time for usdb.Anymore because all my usdd is in the.Pool. there's no way to return the money to.You other than creating a claimant.Balance.Another case would be if your usdb trust.Line still existed.But because the pool has moved in your.Favor which is kind of unlikely for.These particular assets but whatever.Imagine then you no longer have.Sufficient limit to receive the.Additional amount of usb.Usdb that you would have gotten they're.All kind of variations on this problem.Or it's like oh I also have some order.Book.Offers and their five liabilities and.Then that causes me to have insufficient. available limit to receive the.Balance stuff like that.Okay thanks i'll have to think about it.As well there's.Also a bit of discussion about this on.The mailing list i.It's like quite a few posts from the.Bottom now but nikolai was.Having one of the things nikolai was.Chewing on was this notion of.Capping off the available balance.Like the available supply of an asset .Because right now it's actually possible.For an assets about like.Total supply to exceed in 64 max which.Is interesting.I went and looked and there were like 30.Assets all with funny names or.Largely with funny names that have this.Condition. and so I don't think anybody serious.Has this problem.And if we avoided this situation it.Might make a lot of other.Things simpler and it might avoid some.Cases with. with liabilities and stuff but like.It's definitely not like an obvious win.There are still still some other things.That can happen.We probably need additional cases.Additional constraints in addition to.But you can you can read more about that.On the mailing list because I don't even.Remember what was in that post entirely.Great any other questions or topics that.We want to go over today or should we.Just sort of.Mull over what what what we've
