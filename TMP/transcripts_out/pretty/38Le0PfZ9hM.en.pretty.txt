It is .102 so hello everyone welcome to.Today's panel my name is Anal and I'm a.Program manager on the ecosystem team at.The Stellar development foundation which.Is a nonprofit organization founded in.2014 to support the development and.Growth of the open source Stellar.Network so welcome everyone so today.I'm we are having a panel about how.To succeed in the Stellar Community Fund.Now will we will talk about the. Stellar Community Fund quite a bit and.We will also refer to it as an AB.Abbreviation SCF so you'll be hearing.That a lot SCF stands for Stellar.Community Fund and SDF stands for.Stellar development foundation so so.Be sure to take note of that but what is.SCF so the Stell Community Fund is an.Open application grant program hosted by.SDF .That serves as the springboard for many.Businesses and Developers for many.Businesses building an on Stellar to.Turn their Concepts into tangible.Products and services and it's also .Where SDF is providing funding but.Actually the community allocates .Allocates where the funding goes to .So together with its predecessor the.Stellar Brill challenge has been around.Actually since 2016 it's quite ancient.In the blockchain industry and has.Distributed almost 200 million lumens to.Hundreds of Stellar based projects based.On community input including familiar.Names like Stellar expert Lobster.Light Min and ancl and a few names that.You'll hear very soon so if you ever.Looked at Grand space and `stellar.org`.You see that we actually have many.Grants but SCF is really quite special. three reasons all kinds of use cases.And pro projects scope sizes are.Welcome and the community is actively.Involved in guiding and supporting .The projects as well as voting for.Projects they want to see earn a grant.And SCF grants are are no strings.Attached so that means that Grant.Recipients decide how to spend their.Grant and don't have to pay anything.Back so it's quite special how does.SCF work in short it gives these like.You know Community companies and.Builders an opportunity to present.Stellar based projects to the BR Stell.Community for feedback and gives the BR.Stellar Community an opportunity to give.Feedback and weigh in which projects.To serve Lumen grants we are doing it.Currently by anually on a Cadence on.In the form of rounds so each of these.Rounds are listed on community fund.Stellar.org. they have a set pool of lumens.Allocated for distribution to winning.Projects of that round and they consist.Of a few few phases that you see here.Currently we're actually in the.Submission phase for the 11th . edition of the Stell Community Fund.And has a total pool of 8 million xlm to.Distribute so that means that any.Eligible developer team or company.Building on Stellar can submit now to.The SCF and request funding up to 200k.Depending on their project scope so .Aside from funding participating in the.SCF allows you to gather useful feedback.From a community gain Traction in the.Ecosystem and open up a unique.Opportunities for growth we're also.Having a very exciting startup boot camp.If you submit before September 25th.So definitely look into this but to.Be considered for participation then.Really to you know before your.Project reaches Community eyes your.Project need to pass the selection panel.First and this is no small feat so last.Round actually less than a third of.Submissions were selected to move.Forward and to learn how to set up your.Project for Success stay on to hear.From leaders of Allstar pro project.Winners of the previous Ed SCF rounds.Alfred pay beans app Leaf Global fintech.Stellar Global and qued on how to set.Your project up for Success so I talked.A lot but let's start with some.Introductions and we'll start with.Alfred P so take it.Away an thank you so much for having us. just a little bit of intro on us in.Alfred pay we participated in Sellar.Community Fund number nine we are.Fortunate to be one of the winners there.A little bit about us and what we do.We're currently an anchor on the network.That processes usdc payouts into the.Dominican Republic our ideas to scale.From there and also build the.Dominican Republic stable coin as we.Scale our solution there and vertically.We also have the Alfred pay wallet which.Is a user facing product and we brand.Ourselves as a web 2.5 company because.We use blockchain as the underlining.Tech but we provide a traditional.Payment experience so users are able to.Send USC by connecting their bank.Account with plaid Apple pay or V.Master cards and then very much like the.Money gam integration our goal is is.Start with that and we try to provide as.Many outlets into local currency as.Possible so currently we're part of the.Largest ATM network on the ground in the.Dominican Republic that allows you to.Withdraw in over 800 ATMs on the.Ground so USC for local Dominican pesos. also over 150 brick and mortars aside.Of the ones that money gram has which I.Believe they have an additional 600.There and last but not least door to.Door delivery so door to door cash.Delivery in under two hours in exchange.For usdc which is something super.Powerful and yeah last but not least.We're operational in the Dominican.Republic as I mentioned right now and.In quarter four of this year we're going.To be launching our anchor in.Haiti wow that's really impressive I.Can't believe like it's been a while.Since I also heard from you and every.Time I hear from you it seems like.You've like just done so many new.Developments and really making real.Change for people so this is really.Exciting great well thank you so much.For being on board let's hear from .Beans app.Next great yeah thank you my name is.Wter founder of beans app and beans app. took part in the last SCF round on.Number 10 and beans is a non-custodial.Wallet that enables anyone to send.Internationally at zero fee. so the problem we saw as many people.Building on Stellar know is that that.International payments are slow and.Expensive and blockchain could solve.That but it's often very complicated for.Normal people so what we've done is.Build a noncustodial app that removes.All the the crypto or blockchain .Things to the back end so as a user that.Means you don't interact with private.Keys you don't interact with trust lines.Or any of that so when you create your.Wallet you choose your favorite currency.For example dollars and then if you want.To send money to someone in I don't know.Argentina that wants to receive peso all.You have to do is look them up the app.Will know that they want to receive.Pesos and show you the right conversion.And all you have to do is type in how.Much you want to send so you don't even.Have to think about the currency they.Want to receive and that all with zero.Fees so and the same you can do with.Requests so you can request something.And when someone pay it it will.Automatically convert into the right.Currency for.Them so that's beans so basically a.Global venmo is what we're trying to.Build here. super excited to be part of this so. thanks yeah I was also really excited.When I when I heard that you as you.Know long Community longtime Community.Member like finally like had a project.And it was like super like I really.Like this project like it seems like.It's it's a got a very it it like this.Has been an existing problem right but.Really having like such a Innovative.And and like such a like really great.Design and and great thinking about for.The solution I think that's that's.What's really unique and yeah so I'm.Very excited all right well we'll hear.More from you but let's go I want to.Hear now from funto of.Quid fto are you able I think you need.To unmute.First okay sorry about that hi.Everyone fto barice I'm out of Abuja.Nigeria I'm excited to be here and.Part of we won in SCF round nine. and cryto is an online facturing.Platform that where transactions.Are streamlined where smes can get.Paid fast cas cash what when they.Sell their invoices and how we're.Leveraging Stellar Stellar .Platform or the the blockchain is is.Really to optimize the payment and.Financial transactions and for us.Particularly we're optimizing for.Quick transparent and efficient.Invoicing financing for smes we the.Funding we got in the saf round nine.Definitely helped us to build we're.Still build mode but we've been able.To sort of make inroads we pivoted a.Bit because we were focusing on smes.Before right now we're working trying.To work with vendors directly just.Because of some of the issues with.Repayments and things like that but .Excited to be here to answer any.Questions that anybody.Has awesome yeah no it's exciting I.Remember so quid was also like.Participated in a 2021 boot camp with.The fs lab and you were also very.Early in development then and kind of.Seeing how much you've already grown.Right and it it's kind of .Unprecedented almost for like a start up.Like I think it's it's really great.Great work there so yeah excited to hear.More from your learnings as well but.We have two more introductions Nat.From Leaf Global fintech take it away.Great thank you and thank you all for .For having us Leaf is a digital wallet.That was designed initially for refugees.And migrants people who are fleeing.Conflict and carrying cash across.Borders but may have a mobile phone and.So we've designed our wallets to work.And help customers who have both.Smartphones or non-smartphones we use a.Technology called ussd that's very.Prominent throughout Africa and East.Africa where customers can load funds.Onto our wallet and cross those.Borders safely without carrying cash.So we are live in Kenya Uganda and.Rwanda and looking to expand to more.Partners and more countries throughout.Africa but really have designed leave to.Be a a global solution we spent a lot.Of time in Colombia and helping and.Talking to Venezuelan migrants coming.Across the border and everyone facing.The same challenge of carrying cash.Having a phone can't get a bank.Account but I think can really.Benefit from from these Services I.Will say also that we launched nft .Art sales program for some of our.Refugee customers on Leaf to help.Them create and mints nfts on life mint.And then sell sell those to the global.Community and then we would send those.Funds directly to their Leaf wallets.That's been a lot of fun and exciting to.Work on with.Stellar yeah yeah no thank you and leaf.Global fex also been around for quite a.Bit like I think it was the seventh.Round right this is already feels like.Ages.Ago yeah yeah yeah yeah you're.Old-Timers in this this new industry no.But I think it's it's really great and.Really cool to see such an Innovative.Use case as well that's making real.Impact so yeah no looking forward to. hearing from you more and last but.Not least Sam from Stellar Global take.It away hey Ana hey everybody great to.See all these faces again yeah so I'm.Sam and I founded a community called.Stellar Global actually back man.2019 and so actually been doing it for a.While and and really it it was .Kind of birth out the notion that I.Always looked at Stellar as this.Incredible opportunity to Foster.Entrepreneurs and developers and.Really help to build economic .Prosperity and opportunities for a lot.Of people and so yeah Stellar Globe.Has been great we entered into the.Fund actually just last year so I think.This was what the 10th one was it the.10th one I'm wondering was it the 10th.11th I don't even know what number we.Were now no you were in the ninth so it.Wasn't all right yeah so so it's been.Great it's really allowed the ability.To do a lot more onsite this past.Year having a chance to speak at Davos. and be a voice also head to.Washington DC where we helped to.Advocate for Black and Latino . developers and entrepreneurs that are.Building on chain as well as several.Other things you know doing podcast.Videos engagement so yeah we could.Talk a lot more in detail later on but. really glad to be here awesome well.Thank you we're honored that you're here.Sam is definitely the most active .Community member that we have and even.Much more than that like you're also.Part of light Min now right yeah yeah.Another SDF winner as well I got.To meet Fred back in 2019 as well and.So it's been great I on a a strategic.Advisor for light mint and we're.Doing some great things so really really.Happy shout out to Fred awesome yes.Shout out to Fred if he's watching.Hopefully U well you know and that.Really leads us into the discussion.Right and so here if you're here in the.Audience if you're on Zoom you have the.Chance as a an audience member to ask.Questions to any of these panelists and.I will be taking a look at the the.Questions the Q&A section here so.Definitely add your questions and I I.Will ask them if they're you know if.They're relevant to the discussion so.Let me stop sharing my screen and .Let's start in panel mode so let's go.Into one of the first questions so for.The like for about 15 minutes I really.Would like to know a little bit more.About your experience like coming into.The SCF and how they how you've grown.Since then so yeah like like you know.And this can be of any phase like maybe.The you know the submission or like the.Community discussion like what was your.Experience in the SCF anyone feel.Free to chip in otherwise I'm going to.Assign.Someone all right Sam since you have.Your microphone.Unmuted yeah you know for for me.It was great so you know I started.Off like I said as a community member. and I typically looked at the CF .Strictly from like a business like okay.Like look at the businesses that are.That are joining in but for myself as.Sanka mentioned I was spending a lot of.Time just in doing things and so what.The SCF funds allowed you know us to.Do was really from encouragment one from.The Community they're like hey look.There's a lot more you know you could do.You know we're spending a lot of time.Involved in this you know you.Definitely should reach out to it and.So getting involved was was really .Great going through the process .And yeah it's really allowed just for.Larger exposure not just for Stellar.Global but you know the entire .Stellar ecosystem as a whole I got to.Do a lot more traveling and really put.That I guess the message and the the.Mission of what Stellar is all about.On the road and I think it helped to.Make a lot a lot more impact and then.Also you know having those funds.Allowed me to free up my time I wasn't.Working throughout the air kind of.Focus solely on this and so it allowed.For a lot more Twitter spaces a lot more.Engagements you know speaking with.Leaders all across the world so.Yeah it I think it's helped there and.We've seen just that sort of impact.Within the community members I'm.Really happy the way Stellar Global.Itself has grown out you know from it.We've seen other businesses we.There's many here on the call here that. has used our utilized and leveraged.The community I know I've interviewed.Like say leave Global I've been down to.Miami to see what Diego was doing.Firsthand and and and really support.Alfred pay so I think it really opened.Up those Dynamics and then we're seeing.Other folks that are doing things as.Well I mean you seen from Stellar Global.You see for instance what eir has is.His impact that has been that he's put.Out throughout the community as well. we see people let's say like the.SDF who has been leveraging the Stella.Global community directly as well well. their Community manager manager is in.There often we see members of the.Engineering team that are leveraging . Stellar Global Discord as well so you.Know I think it's it's really helped to.Kind of create a a foundation of the.Culture for the community and and.Hopefully that can spread into other.Endeavors but yeah I'll pause there.Awesome yeah know I really enjoy.Being in there it's also like everyone's.Also so like positive right because you.Have like so many communities like out.There on the internet and it's like you.Know like oh like you kind of have to.Try it carefully because like you know.There there's scams left and right right.Especially in the crypto Community but. Stellar Global like when I was in there.Like people are just so nice and like.You know and that and that is like.Really good Community Management like.Fostering that culture is so important.So yeah definitely shout out and shout.Out to some people that you mentioned.Like's shout out to John I know he's in.There all the time spintax great well.Speaking about Community right vouter.I know that you've also been in the.Community for a long time how did you.Get started and then how did what was.Your experience in the SCF like what.Stood.Out yeah I think this this idea of. wanting to pay in a non-custodial way. and for being able to pay anyone has.Been in my mind for quite a long time.And since I traveled to east of Asia and.Having to pay or transfer my money.From euros into the local currency was.Very hard and I found Stellar and did it.By that in.2017 and then I was really in inspired.And hoping for for some Global ven mode.To come up and then I haven't seen it so.Started it and then on on the experience.Of SCF what I think is besides the.Funding and speeding up your development.What is super interesting is that you.Are forced to do a lot of things.Basically by taking part so what you do.Is you get engagement from very .Engaged testers so you get people that.That want to review what you're doing so.They give you very valuable feedback so.That's very important to us as well .So that's one another one is that we did.This community pitch right so yeah.You're forced to write down what your.Problem is what what product you.Offering so that that's good to think.About you write it down as well as.Part of your submission which is good to.Do you can easily fall into the Trap.That yeah I've got it all in my mind.Right but it's good to to write it down.For someone else to read.It and then finally you have a whole.Network of people seeing what you build.So people can reach out to you in a very.Early phase and and create valuable.Connections from that so I think in the.Experience it's it's way more than just.Applying to get funding it's it's also a.Process that gives you a lot of value I.Think yeah.Yeah yeah no I think that's yeah that.Because that's also what I hear hear.From a lot of people that like yeah I.Mean they you know they need funding.Like everyone needs funding to get.Started to fund their development to.Fund like any like to scale their.Project right but I guess like what.People walk away with is really that.Experience like let's say like Nat.Fto or Diego does that resonate with any.Of you feel free to Che.In yeah so for me you know I was very.I mean fortunate and privileged to have.Attended the boot camp before joining.The community and I think that was a.Game changer like you you mentioned. we were very early early stage when.We applied and that's one thing I would.Say say to anybody who's listening you.You don't have to have like a a a.Project or you know you know.Something that is already established or.You know it could be early stage and you.Can still apply right and I always.Help that I'm a non-tech female founder.So I literally learned a lot during the.Book camp and just even in terms of just.You know design thinking and all that.Right was is very great and then joining.The the community I will say that. similar to what w had said you know.There are people who will kick the tires.Around your idea and sort of challenge.You and then you have to go back and.Sort of look at what you're doing and.Say oh does this make sense or how do I.Solve this or how do I answer this.Because you know that they're somewhat.Waiting for your response right so you.Go back to your team and you're like.Okay so what is you know how do we solve.This right this is a problem and if.These people are asking this question it.Means other people are going to ask the.Question so for me it the the.Community was great that way but like.I said I you know people sometimes might.Not apply because maybe they're worried.Or scared or for me I if I could apply.And you know I'm still on this panel.Today talking I'll encourage anybody.Who's building anything on using.Blockchain to apply because you never.Know one again there are people in the.Community who are willing to support who.Are willing to help who are willing to.Ask questions who are willing to you.Know give their five cents as needed .So you can't really go wrong right so it.All like an incubation place as well.Where you're building but there's a lot.Of safety to some degree around it where.You're not just flailing by yourself all.Over the place so again I would.Encourage everybody who's you know maybe.Of two minds to definitely check.It out and definitely apply awesome oh.That's I'm I'm like really happy to hear.That your experience as well especially.Like you know really like using it as as.Some like feedback like a space also.Like to develop like it's not that you.Don't need to send in a you know.Completely perfect Pro product or.Because well there is nothing like.You're always going to iterate you're.Always going to develop. yeah and so like let's say like .Diego like I know that you've.Participated in SCF 9 so that was a bit.More of the recent rounds where we had.You know all these different like phases.As well like what what did what.Jumped out for you and what was your..Experience our EXP experience in SCF in.SCF was awesome first and foremost.Like I think it was it was fitting for.Sam to talk first because one of our.First images of seller other than going.On and reading a little bit about what.Stellar does what Sam platform through.Stellar Global so being able to dive.Further into Stellar Global and and see.Some of the previous projects what other.Projects on the ecosystem are building. it it really gave us that had to.Start and also we connected with Sam I.Think that connecting with Sam is never.A bad idea and I think that everybody.Here can can vouch to that but our.Experience for stf was was great for us.We we are really passionate about what.We're building like water Comm said.Earlier like the payment space today is.Is extremely inefficient and through.Stellar we're able to to build that.Change and one of the coolest things is.That we're all if you're applying for.The SCF the concept is that you're.Building a long-term project correct.Like your project doesn't end right.After the Community Fund is over and.What that means is that you're going to.Have to raise a lot of money .Truthfully but one of the cool things.Is that the audience here is the.Audience that is receptive to seller.Know what is knows the power of so you.Get that validation from the community.That is a able to fund your project and.Then catapult you I mean we've been.Extremely extremely blessed post SCF.And I think that this is also credit to.LEAP Global we got into the Berkeley.Blockchain accelerator which as I.Said leap Global paved the way for us in.That in that side but all the things.Wouldn't have been possible without the.Validation of the community so the.Community saw we were building they.Appreciated us they gave us that funding.It's giving us the ability to build and.Then it's open doors to accelerators.Open networks to different investors .Of of folks that I look at and I'm like.How the heck did we get here in such.Short period amount of time but it's.A cool thing about building it's a cool.Thing about this community as you.Mentioned there's a lot of communities.In crypto but I think the cool thing.About staler is that it's an open.Network it it enables inter.Interoperability like beans is.Building something similar to what we're.Building but the cool thing is that a.Beans user can send out for pay user we.Can cash them out in our local country. we're we're an interoperable platform.That really empowers entrepreneurs to.Collaborate together and and yeah and.It really is most to credit to the SCF.And and and what what you and the team.Have built through here so thank you.Well not not only me there's actually a.A whole group of verified members in.The Stellar Community Fund that gives.Input and and really like allows for.That feedback right so shout out to our.The life force of the Stell Community.Fund our verified members sorry all.Right but yeah no that's that's.Really where that comes from and yeah I.Mean you mentioned how the that we got.Here well I know how you got here .Through through the stall Community Fund.Right and also through that you did such.Hard work and you actually you know did. a lot of things that set you up for.Success and we're going to get that in.In that more detail later on but.First I wanted to hear a bit about .From from that like before we dive into.Kind of the advice part Nat I know.That Alfred PES mentioned you on the.Accelerator part as well you started.With the blockchain Berkeley accelerator.But how did you decide to go even into.The Stellar Community Fund how did you.Make that that yeah that I guess yeah.Switch know it's just to Echo everyone.Else the the community has been.Incredible just fantastic and growing.Every year too I think you know when we.First started it was a little less well.Known with investors and other community.Members but it's it's it's incredible.Now and especially allot of the work.That Sam's been doing he's been.Promoting us so much it's been you.Know just unbelievable how much he's.He's been over backwards to help us so.We're very appreciative of that and you.Know Sam's out speaking to Davos and.Like promoting the work that Stellar's.Doing globally and that's only getting. getting better so it's it's really.Been an honor to be part of this.Community I'd say Tori and I Tori.Co-founder of leaf had a great time out.In Meridian in in Mexico and I think.That was a really our first big.Opportunity just to see what the.Community looks like and now that we're.Able to have more inperson events I'd.Highly recommend anyone you know to.Attend to attend those and a network and.To see what's out there what's building.And you know people are just.Supportive and helpful it's it's a.Fantastic experience in community and.So I after leaving all those.Accelerators we did a lot of.Accelerators so people want advice on.Accelerators and boot camps we're happy.To help but brookley was a fantastic one.And a lot of them don't come with.Funding you know that's one of the.Downside a lot of support you know.Networks we'll connect to investors but.When it comes to actually putting in.Capital there's very few that do that.And that's what was I think.Transformative for us with SCF is is.Actually now leveraging some of that.Capital to use and some of the early.Stage work that investors won't .Support and fund and it's it's all.Worked out for us as.Well awesome yeah no that's great to.Hear yeah because like you need both.Sides right you need that support that.Support is like so important but then.You also need that early stage capital.And sometimes it's difficult to get.Because investors like you actually like.Need to to show a lot and that you've.Done a lot and especially for early.Stage like you know you got to get.Started and SCF is like this like you.Know Kickstart funding almost that no.Strings attached to don't need to pay.Back you don't even need to work on.Your project anymore if you don't want.To we do encourage you and there is a.Guilt tripping if you don't do it just.Kidding from from the community but.Anyway you know it's like this unique.Opportunity really to to get funding.And it's quite yeah you don't really.See that very often even in the.Blockchain ecosystem so well great it.Just great also to hear from your.Experiences and now in the last like.Half an hour or so I really want to . like well the actually the audience.Really wants to know how they can.Improve their submission as they're.Writing them right now for scf1 and.This is very important and so you've.Been through the process you have worked.So much on your on your startup and and.Your company right and I really want to.Know now how you set yourself up for.Success in the SCF so. let's dive let's dive into to that.Right. we start with here I also have some.Audience questions and we can we can.Kind of a free flowing discussion here. but I think like a lot of questions.Here actually go about the.Community engagement here from Carlos.There's a question how to best engage.With voting members of the community so.Who wants to start. yeah I get that question a lot you.Know I think that ultimately you.Know ultimately I feel that where.People let's say make the biggest.Mistake is that you know well number one.Find something that you're passionate.About right I think sometimes people.Find you know business you know they.They kind of look at the SCF as like as.Strictly from look I can create a job or.Money the money side of it right and I.Just think that's the wrong way of.Looking at it because you know to really.Engage in the community you have to be.In the community you know there's you.Know right now in Stellar Global there.It's a different time zone for for.Somebody different right you know so.It's like you know it might be 4:00 am.To you but it's 1 pm to somebody else.And etc etc and so you really got to be.Engaged in the community the only way.You can be engaged in community is if a.You're passionate about what you're.Trying to build.And to be passionate about something you.Have to really believe that you're.Solving a problem you know you know.Like I could I can look at at everybody.Here and can tell you that they've all.Been like actively involved in a wide.Range of conversations you know we.Talked about liment you know Fred is.Yeah he has liment but then he's.Passionate about you know okay like how.Is the code being built out you know you.Know what's you know what's the.Structure are is the community are these.Businesses you know adhering to the.Centralization and some of the core.Components of the community so you have.To be you know really passionately and.Actively involved and when you're.Involved in all these conversations and.You know people are going to find you.People are gonna know who you are.They'll get to they'll get comfortable.With you and so that way when you do.Have an SCF entrance it's like okay I.Know what you're doing I understand you.You're actually trying to solve a.Problem .Now you can start building up that.Engagement so you know that's my.Long-winded answer for.That yeah I also I.Also I wanted to add to that I would.My advice would be to reach out early .Simply because once the Community Fund.Is going on let's say for the for the.40 days that it's going on people are.Reaching out to the to the verified.Members consistently and some of it may.Feel like spam I guess just to kind.Of say it bluntly but if you're if.You're reaching out early and and to to.To different members at the end of the.Day it means that you know you're.Interested in communicating you're.Interested in connecting with with these.Folks and the truth of the matter is.That we've all been in the shoes and at.Least I can say it for myself where.Somebody reached out to me and gave me a.A helping hand like and as I.Mentioned Sam has been a great example.Of that like.We need the community at the end of the.Day to believe in our projects and and.We're excited about what people are.Building because the stronger that the.Stellar network is the stronger that our.Projects are but my advice would be.To reach out early to to some of the.Verified members if you see projects.That you know correlate with some things.That you're doing reach out ask advice. and and yeah but I would I would I.Think that the best strategy would be to.Reach out sooner rather than later.Because once the Community Fund is going.On most of us are going through the.The projects themselves reading them one.By one it's there's there's a good.Amount of projects and that might not.Be the greatest time to connect so.Yeah yeah just to Echo what Diego.Said I think you you definitely will get.What you put into it so you know if you.Don't engage at all it will reflect. and if you leave it too late like.He's saying then you know you're not.Going to get the sort of engagement that.You're looking for so engage sooner .And for me I think there are some people.Who stand out when it comes to.Engagement right and even if you can.Just you know connect with those the.People that stand out right who either.Give you feedback or you see them.Responding a lot to different people you.Know I call those people the.Champions of the of the of the of the.Community right because they're they're.Very engaged and so even if you can.Either follow them or ask them questions. they to get a lot of reads as well so.I think you know having a strategy.Around that as well is also very.Important yeah so I'm hearing here like.Definitely like engage early and engage.In in multiple conversations like you.Know like don't like it's not only like.Well if you really want to maximize your.Chances I think what Sam also mentions.Like go in the actual like go in Stellar.Developers Discord go in Stellar Global.Like participate in some of the overall.Like Stellar discussions too if that.Like is relevant for your issue like I.Mean in Fred's case I know that he's.Been activate active for nfts and.Stellar like so much he's in all these.Conversations right and so I think.That's really exciting like you really.Get involved with the community and and.And work on a problem that you're really.Passionate about further on like .On community engagement vouter I know.That this is another question think that.Came up somewhere but I believe .You've been also really active on social.Media and I think that's one of the.Other things like not only like the.Discord right like all over so yeah I.Would love to hear a bit more about.That yeah that's that's more.My many years long enthusiasm about.Stellar and its potential to change.People's lives.Basically so and that that gives you.A lot of people that are enthusiastic.About the same thing right and maybe to.Add to the the last one is what is.Engagement maybe that was what I was.Thinking is I don't think engagement is.Like telling what you're building and.Then getting some response I think you.You can you're in a super early phase so.It's very interesting also to cut it in.Small pieces and get feedback from.People on specific parts so that the.Answer isn't very complex and also.You're not really like trying to.Convince something someone that you're.Building something cool but just getting.Feedback which is already.Valuable and you can do that on.Social media as well I think that that's.Also a great way to get a lot of.Feedback basically like what is the.Engagement of the things you're building.And are people excited about what you're.Showing them so I think it's a great way.To connect with.People yeah I like that aspect a lot not.Just like hey you don't need to.Convinced that your product is the.Greatest of all time you can actually. listen right listen more and listen.To their feedback and show also like I.Mean obviously like it has to be.Constructive feedback right in the.Communities it can can go all over the.Place but if it's constructive listen.And Implement and follow up I think.That's really important and then .Community members like you have a you.Build your track record with them that's.Very important yeah I wanted to add. kind of on to what Walter just said.And bring back up Fred as well is you.Know Fred you know he he was I think.Disqualified from the first his first.Entrance into the SCF and then when I.Think his his first time going through.After that I want to say he lost the SCF.Before finally winning and so this is.Somebody who was obviously been really.Involved but you know the key is being.Humble right is the fact that you know.He was humble he kept on he's he going.Back to what was mentioned earlier he.Took feedback came back and.Reiterated okay let me try to explain it.In this this way Walter somebody else.Who's been highly involved in the.Community you know back in the day he.Had like the Stellar torch and was.Really influential in the early days as.Far as helping to build up the whole.Aspect of community but you know shout.Out to him when he was starting off his.Project he didn't come in with an.Arrogance of like hey this is the best.Product there is he came back exactly.Exact how we saying it he was giving he.Was asking for a lot of feedback you.Know here's a screenshot what do you.Think of this so it was this active.Engagement from somebody who's you know.I would say understands the network very.Well has a long history within the.Community but he still came out and.Did the work and that goes a long way.And so so yeah just want to reiterate.The importance of just being humble and.And really engaging and getting feedback.From people and being genuine about it.Yeah yeah I think I think that's that's.Really like how how you really built.That track record I think I think it's.Not just a one One Stop Shop right it's.It's really like you can actually also.Submit multiple times to the SCF like.You can start with a small budget and.Kind of get your foot in the door ask.For lots of feedback even if your.Project is not quite finished yet and.Then next time you can ask for more and.Kind of like show that you've.Implemented the feedback so yeah.Especially with with Fred like.Enlightment like it's it's it's quite.Interesting to see like that that like.The many times like they submitted.Didn't win but submitted again anyway.Right and not only does that show .A track record for the community it also.Shows it for like you know SDF whenever.We have grants right oh this Pro this.Project really wants to be part of the.Sell ecosystem like they it's like a.Qualifier almost so definitely I think.That that is really great to just.Keep going ask for feedback and stay.Humble great advice Nat I see that you.Have your mic unmuted I wanted to hear a.Bit more from you about what your advice.Is to just quickly no I think it's all.Been said well and yeah I think.There's no matter what you're building.Somebody's already you know done.Something similar or solved a lot of.Your problems and I think we found a lot.Of support and and resources.Certainly for the wallet business.There's a lot of those instellar so.If it's groups like lobster or one.Called rehive in South Africa that we.Were able to connect with early on to.Get advice and also to to share back you.Know I think we were one of the few that.Had Incorporated ussd technology and and.We're able to kind of share sort of best.Practices what's worked and what hasn't.Or if there's other on andof ramps.That we've had more success with I.Think there's you know plenty to to give.Back to but I also feel like this is.Maybe an area that we could have done.More with I think the challenge that we.Had with our wallet is not a lot of our.Users are you know online on the.Internet so it was tough to get least.You know feedback from anyone within the.The Stellar Community about our our.Wallet because they couldn't download.And and use it and I think that hurt us.A little bit compared to some others.That could say look this is the feedback.This is how we've engaged the community.This is some of the things that we've.Incorporated so I definitely think we.Could have done a better job earlier on.Re-engaging with the the community so.We've gotten so much support since then.But yeah I was definitely one I think.Could have strengthened our.Application yeah I guess that's also.Like points out that there so such a.Wide variety in project and yeah.Sometimes like maybe like beans for.Example you're having like you know you.Can really find your users in the.Community but in other cases like your.Value like feed feedback is going to.Be a bit different so yeah I mean and.And as that you were also talking a bit.About you know that user validation and.And you've been working on Leaf.Global for a while what is some other.Advice that that you would give to like.New submitters to put in their.Submission sure and this is I think.Something that helps set us apart a.Little bit and also with fundraising .Too is just going from that idea to like.A handful of you know test users or.Just something real theoretical to.Actually like moving money and and.Getting real live users and processing.Transactions I think that is a huge.Hurdle to do and it's tough to get.The you know regulation the licensing.The partners being able to move funds.Getting kyc right like there's a ton.Involved there going from zero to one .Is is a big heavy lift I think that it.Might just been timing that we were.Lucky with that with with our.Applications that we finally got over.Some of those hurdles after like five or.Six false starts and you know get things.Going and then it would shut down and.Then another partner would get shut down.Starting with another so just the.Startup life but I think that is.Really key to be able to articulate that.I feel like that really helped us a bit.Is like this is more than an idea we've.Got you know at the time I think five or.6 thousand customers that were.Processing you know 100,000 plus.Transactions like we actually had good.Data on the flow and you could see it.All was all all on the the Sellar.Explorer so like that was fun to be able.To then show is like we're actually.Opening accounts for people people are.Using it this is how the the flows are.And so trying to get to that step as.Early as you can I think.Helps yes user validation numbers data.Like show show data to convince like.You don't like U you can prove that your.Product works right especially on I mean.Stellar right I mean yeah you can see it.On Stellar expert like it's all recorded.You can't even fake it right so I think.That's really exciting so I think.That's a really great lesson for people.It's like you know do your homework .Get user validation early like show what.You've done like prove your track record.I think even if it's as you know.Little as just a few people like if a.Few people really like your project and.And you know you're in early stage.There's a big chance that a lot of.People will right so yeah let's let's.See who who has anything to add to.That like numbers and how did you get to.Those numbers like what are some like.Advice that you would give anyone here.Feel free to chip.In you see some people.Unmuting I I'll I'll add to that because.I think that that's something that we've.Actually been been dealing with recently.And I love that point of getting from.Zero to one one of the best advice.That we got recently was that when your.Product launches it should suck and.That's okay because part of it is is.Understanding what's not working what is.Working and so on so one of our biggest. priorities as of late has been.Exiting beta and getting the product.In the hands of people to see what's.Actually working what's not working what.Users like what they don't like and.Someone like me who's like.Details of like every like no this has.To be like two fonts smaller and it has.To be in this corner instead of this one.Like it it has brought some like.Perfection paralysis I guess to to what.We've been so focused and excited on.Building but I'm just so excited to.Get this in the hands of people like.We recently launched our anchor in our.In our exiting beta October 1st and if I.Wouldn't have gotten that advice which.Is exactly what Nat is is pointing at we.We would probably still be so paralyzed.In in the process of getting everything.Right and it's understanding that your.Product is never going to be perfect in.This stage and that's why we're here you.Know that there's no better Community to.Rely on feedback than than this.Community so I just wanted to add those.Points to.That yes so you're hearing your project.Should suck if you're submitted to the.SCF no but I mean that that's obviously.I think that's a that's a really great.Piece of feedback and that's what I've.Been hearing too like it doesn't need to.Be perfect the first time your MVP.Should be like super like simple super.Like basic doesn't need to be perfect.Don't over engineer and just get it in.Front of people I think that's great .Great.Advice let me see we have a anyone.Wants to add to that before we go into.Next.Section right right no so the project.Isak very good advice I love that but.Obviously we're here to make it better.Like and and it's always going to be re.Like iterative and you can even work as.As was mentioned here partner with.Companies like make it better like.There's new opportunities if you just.Get it out in front of people we have.A question here from John Woodard and.This goes a bit more into the demos and.Kind of like graphics and whatnot so.What sort of like demos are expected and.And what are the what are some advice.That some of the panelists would give.Around this. I mean oh go ahead go ahead Walter.Yeah what what I would say is that I.Don't know if there's any.Expectances it depends on what you're.Building but what I would say is that be.Careful to look at design no matter what.You do if it's not your presentation.Or if you're building a consumer facing.Product at least take a look at your.Design if you don't have a designer in.Your team find find someone that can.Help you even if you do it through I.Don't know Fiverr or something make sure.That it stands out it looks good but.Also use it to to structure what you're.Building because if you go through.Design process you will run into.Challenges it will improve your product.But it will also make make it easier to.Explain to people why what you're.Building is unique so I would say .No matter what you do and what you show.Be careful to to take a look at design.As well make look.Good yeah making it look good is very.Important I think like a lot of.People like like including me like we.Like verifi members read a lot of.Submissions and it's nice to actually.See some some visual assets and I I.Know beans you did that really well.Beans actually had a really great demo.Unfortunately my Discord recording.Skills weren't as good so I cannot I.Cannot reproduce but definitely the.Next candidate pitches we we should be.All set on that let me see like I.Actually you know like the design was.Really good on all of these the the.Project panelist that are here and.Definitely check it out on on the.Project site on seller Community Fund.Website let me see because I offered.Pay I also really liked your designs as.Well did you do.Any I was actually gonna gon to mention.Exactly what you of that the cool thing.Is that you're able to go through some.Of the previous projects that are.Winners and and see what they put.Together and that's something that we.Did for sure before we submit our.Application was go through some of the.Previous winners see what they had done.And to L point I think design is is is.Important one of the things that we.Did and ultimately as we said the the.Whole concept with our projects is is to.To exit out of the Community Fund stage.And you know to grow them so you're.Eventually going to have to build out a.Pitch Teck and a lot of the questions.That come out of the Community Fund are.Questions that you need to have in your.Pitch check so what's the problem that.You're going after what's the solution. so maybe even uploading that slide.From your pitch deck to give it a.Graphic that maybe adds a little bit of.Twist of what your brand is what your.Product does etc might allow to to might.Allow you to stick out versus other.Projects because when you're going when.You when there's so many applications.That are just all text it can be pretty.Hard to just to go through so so so many.Whereas maybe you see like wow these.People have a really cool brand they.Have a really cool way of of.Communicating this to others and and.It's something that that'll stick out so.Definitely go through the previous.Winners on the Community Fund site.And and see what they've done as IA.Said beans did a great job as well so.Definitely go through them and take a.Look and and use use them for.Reference yeah may maybe to add one.Thing is that the pitch which which.We did that wasn't recorded what what.Really helped us is to pre-record our . demo so what we did is did a live.Demo pre-record it and then talk over it.During the pitch so that you you're not.Focused on clicking all the buttons and.All things that can go wrong during a a.Live demo so I think that helped a lot.To to prere Rec it and then put it in.The.Slides yeah that was actually a a legit.Presentation like we were like everyone.Who was watching like Tyler like.Everyone on my team was like whoa like.Pre-record like this is like because.Everything obviously went well right.It's like you were you looked like you.Were doing Livewire and and we were like.Really impressed but yeah know it's like.A those are like some great great.Tactics too let me see we have a few.Minutes here and I want to go onto.Some other questions as well so.Another question I get often is.What's the best strategy for the grant.Amount and I know that you know we've.Actually changed budget guidelines.Quite a bit throughout the SCF.Rounds right now like we maximum.Amount is 200k and but we have.Different projects like of different.Budget Scopes like depending on.The project scope so like we have like.Beneath like 10,000 for small scope.Projects beneath under like.$50,000 worth of xlm for kind of medium.Scope projects that are really like for.New project but also we have under U.200,000 which is really like people.That of existing companies that want.To scale a new product or like .Kickstart a new development on that.Front so yeah here it says what is the.Best strategy to kind of get in for.Into the Stellar Community Fund and I.Know that quid like I know that you.Haven't had any previous can.Really experience right in the Stella.Community and you chose a little bit of.A lower a budget on the lower end can.You tell us a bit more about your.Strategy.There sure so I mean when we when we.Applied we just needed or were.Looking for funding to even just build.Right so we were looking for funding for.Developers for maybe a bit of of a.Marketing campaign and so we I think.We did less than 50,000 if I remember.Correctly yes and you know based on.Advice as well you know just looking.At what other people had done and I I.Mean first of all not to just deviate.But can I just do and can I just brag on.Anchor because I'm telling you look if.She's on your corner you are made right.So let me just quickly brag on her and.Just say that everything she said we.Should do we did right so but there was.A lot of advice around you know how to.Sort of what to do and everything and.She has been such a phenomenal support. and just supporter of just our our.Our you know our product what we're.Trying to build the vision and.Everything so just going back to your.To answer your question so again we.Asked for a smaller amount and we.Actually got it and I'll say even now.When everybody's talking about we've.Been very misly with even those funds.Right because we're using it to we're.Able to pay for developers we were.Able to do some marketing campaign like.I said and we we still have some left.That we're still you know managing.Right and so it's just been.Phenomenal with just what we've been.Trying to do and so anybody who's coming.In unless you already have like an.Established product or something.That already has like a lot of traction.I would say start small and you know.SCF the beauty of of the fund is that.You don't just get it one time and.You're shut out you know you can always.Come back like everybody has said once.You able to prove the concept and you.Know get more traction you can come back.And ask for maybe higher amount and.So don't feel like you have to ask for.The moon first go around you know if you.You know ask for what you need but make.It make it manageable enough that .People within the the the community.Would be able to say okay yeah this is.This makes.Sense yeah yeah I think that that that's.Great advice also to really get get your.Foot in theuring and get get traction.And just build that and you can always.Submit again right all right well we.Actually like the time flies like.It's already almost done and anyone here. any last advice for for scf1.Submitters feel free to.Unmute yeah just have fun you know I.Mean there's there's a lot of great.Opportunities out there I think .There's the I mean since all of us.Have entered there have been continual..Upgrades continuous new .Countries that have been really.Expanding their use cases and so just.Be creative have fun and and do.It yeah I think that's a great point.Just don't don't only do it to win the.Funding but just have fun get feedback.Interact with people improve use it.To write down whatever you're building.Validate your ID so I think that's very.Valuable already so yeah great.Point yeah I would also chime in and say.Well sorry about that I would also Chim.In and say don't don't leave it till the.Last minute to fill out your your.Submission right start working on it now. so that you can sort of you know kick.The tires around it you know let people.Around you sort of look at it read it.Give you feedback put that in the in.The in your submission and then just to.Make it as Crisp And as as as great as.It can potentially be.Thanks going to say something similar I.Feel like it's the the standards have.Got a lot higher since we went in so up.Your game the professionalism of the you.Know of the applications have gotten so.Much better but that being said yeah.There's nothing to lose by just.Applying and getting some great feedback.And especially if you're new to the.Community Jump Jump Right In it's.Really a supportive.One and I I'll add that if if you.Don't win one time or two times keep.Applying because I think that a large.Part of being a Founder is grit and.Being relentless so the community.Loves to see two three time people who.Who apply and I think that that has a.Lot of value so .Yeah thank you so much everyone for that.Advice I think that's yeah it's it's was.Really great to hear from all of you and.Really got into the examples of like you.Know the generic advice that we give all.The time yes that's true our application.Has become a little bit more more.Complicated but that's that's a good.Exercise for you to l write down your.Business you know I'm trying to yeah.We're trying to streamline it every.Round the stf changes every now round.Because we grow with the needs of the.Community and the growing Stellar.Ecosystem which is really exciting we're.Also having some you know sneak peek.We're having some really exciting .Updates for scf2 that I'll be sharing in.The next few weeks so definitely stay.Tuned but in the meantime if you want to.Keep up to date with this and learn more.About the Stell Community Fund we have.An exciting like website that we.Recently renewed shout out to Charles.From our design team it's very great .It's called a community fund.Stellar.org so definitely check out and.Check out the projects the our.Panelists here and many more
