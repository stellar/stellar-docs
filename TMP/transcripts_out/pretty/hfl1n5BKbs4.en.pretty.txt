Hello everyone and welcome to this.Week's Stellar Developer Meeting today. we have the team from blend joining.Us for a code walkr in support of.Their exciting news security Initiative.For the Stell ecosystem I'm Carson as.Usual from the SDF Dev team and and.Alex will join us from script 3 and amen.From Satur to set the stage here .Blend is getting ready to launch their.Blend V2 and in preparation for that.They're opening up that code and for.Groundbreaking.$125,000 in usdc competition focused on.Securing lend V2 through both a.Competitive auditing and a formal.Verification this is the first ever open.Competition competitive audit and formal. verification competition within the. Stellar ecosystem so it's an amazing.Opportunity for Stellar devs to try their.Hand on competing to find bugs and write.Formal verification rules I just get.More familiar with blend in general so. I'll post a link to how to sign up.For the competition the competition.Started this Monday so it is open but.Let me now introduce.Alex hello thanks for having me welcome.Alex. do you just let me know when I am.Ready to get running go ahead you are.All right perfect your screen all right.Thank you so yeah I am Alex you might.See me online as mots2 and I'm the lead.Developer at script 3 and we developed. blend which is a universal liquidity.Protocol primitive just a quick.Overview what we're going to run through.We might go a wee bit fast because.There's a lot of stuff to cover but.I'll give you guys a quick for those who.Aren't familiar just a quick.Breakdown of what blend is how the.Actual contracts all work together .And then I'll run into the code and kind.Of the main thing I'll try and focus on. for those doing the auto.Competition is really going to be how.We test blend and specifically if there.Is some kind of bug or thing you found.Within blend V2 kind of some tips and.Tricks on how you it might be a bit.Easier to prove that something is in.Fact wrong so yeah blend is a.Universal liquidity protocol primitive.And what does that mean basically.Blend is a tool that allows you know.Companies people who are crypto natives.Really any entity that wants a lending.Market to actually go ahead and have one. so lending markets the crypto are.Just places where people can land in.BIO assets from each other and one thing.That blend does is blend basically comes.With an automatic back stop module which.Acts as Insurance bad debt protection.And also scam protection and and these.Things these are funded by anyone and.Kind of the way this all works together.Is the pool will give some portion of.The interest it generates out to the.Back stop module such that it can.Provide that that layer of insurance.For the.Protocol that's just a really brief.Intro as to what blend does I want to.Touch on first actually how the.Contracts all work together since been.Looking at this from a security.Perspective knowing how the main.Components of blend interact is.Pretty vitol so kind of the really like.Cornerstone part of blend is the emitter.Contract this doesn't have very many.Responsibilities it's core one is going.To roughly Define the admin protocol.Token in this case is blend secondly.It's responsible for defining the back.Stop module now the back stop module is.Like I said earlier the contract that.Basically holds all of the insurance.Funds for the blend pools insurance.In this case are going to be blend.Usdc LP tokens so there is a common amm.It's for those familiar with evm it's.Basically balancer but it's just an.LP token for blend.Usdc its main responsibility is it.Actually controls the state of the pool.So if you have a lending market and.There's a back stop module the back stop.Module actually has the ability to turn.The pool on and off so for example if.Something happens to a pool or it gets.Exploited some Oracle goes wrong the.Back stop module actually has the.Ability to disable borrowing for the.Pool secondly it's also the first.Less capital in the event of any bad.Debt and those that might not know.Bad debt is basically the case where .A user has liabilities and they have no.Collateral to cover it so the protocol.Has to take a loss on that debt .Secondly it also manages the blend.Emissions so the protocol basically.Starting from the emitter blend tokens.Will get sent to the back stop module.And it's the back stop module's.Responsibility to send it to all of the.Pools within the blend.Ecosystem within the backstop module. it also defines a pool Factory .This thing drops pretty simple it's a.Contract that contains a pool wasum and.For any pool that's created this is.The thing that validates that this is in.Fact a blend pool and it is the exact.Contract that we expect to be deployed. and then the meat and potatoes of the.Protocol is going to be the actual pool. this is kind of the sort of a part of.The part of the whole protocol it is.The place where people can go and lend.And borrow reserves so there's tons.Of different ways you can set things up. but this is kind of the place where. all the lending and borrowing occurs.And kind of where most user interaction.Will end up taking.Place so I know that was really fast.But hopefully is this is being recorded.Right.Caren I think it is I'll take that as a.Yes y it's recorded perfect so yeah.We can go we can go probably go back and.Watch that over if anything was missed.And I'm also available on Discord if .You want to ask further questions but.We will jump to the actual codes since.That's probably what a lot of you all.Are interested in. so I'll give a quick breakdown of how.Contracts actually exist in soron and.Then we can start trying to dig through.Some of how this how our codes actually.Tested so for those that aren't.Familiar The Way We have set up our.Soron repository is you'll notice that.All of the core contracts that I talked.About earlier are located within their.Own folder so for example all the code.For the back stops within the back stop.Folder pool within the pool pool Factory.Etc. each contract has a contract.RS file.This is really the entry point and.Interaction point for the contract so .You'll you you'll notice that in soran.There are these macros contract contract.Client these are really the things that.Defined how users actually can call into.The contract so anything that's public.Facing is part of this part of this.Trait and will be implemented for the.Back stop contract stru this is also.The location where where we probably.Have all of the most user-facing.Documentation for each of the functions.So if you're ever curious about .What's available on a contract what the.Arguments mean this file will be the.Place where they're documented. so yeah and there's also a contract.Implementation macro so this will be the.Place where a a Constructor is defined. so this is basically called when the.Contract's first deployed and can never.Be invoked again and there's also the.Back stop trait implementation for the.Contract and this is where all of our.Code is basically getting defined so.Everything in here is exposed for.Anyone on the blockchain to interact.With the way we structured things is.We generally do all of the.Authentication that's required to use.The use the contract here and then we.Actually perform all of the logic in a.Second helper function so that we can.Better unit test the code as a whole .So you'll notice if you're ever looking.For authentication things you you'll.Notice that all of the O actually takes.Place here if you are from the evm.World o how Soroban does o is probably.One of the largest differences .Between the two blockchains so it is.Worth looking into it's it's incredibly.Well documented on.Sorond Sor bonds documentation so I.Would highly recommend reading.Through how that works so you and.Then you'll also notice that for example.If I go to where we actually Define the.Logic this is pretty common.Throughout all of our contracts so we we.We'll basically try and wrap all all of.The logic that's external to.Authentication and stuff within a.Function and we actually go through in.Write unit tests specifically for those.Functions so this is a pretty good.Place to look if you think something .Might be incorrect or wrong or a bug.Exists somewhere this is probably one.Of the easiest places to start testing.That and attempting to find whether.Or not something's wrong and you you'll.Often find that this is like kind of.Where most of our unit tests actually.Occur secondly one thing that we do.Include within this blend contracts.Repository is there's mock contracts and.There's also a test Suites folder so.One thing that's really nice about.Interacting with.Soron is as I'm using tests you'll.Notice I have rust analyzer installed on.My fsco but you you you have the ability.To step through debug so if you're ever.Curious about what actual values are.Within a function you're you can use all.The rust internal tools to step through.And actually debug it if you're like.Most developers in the world you're just.Going to add a whole bunch of print.Lines and then run the test that also.Works fantastic too but it's it's.Really nice for example if you do think.Something's wrong make sure to use the.Rust tools and use use all the debugging.Tools to your advantage we've been able.To find a lot of things internally .Using those those strategies but one.Really important thing I wanted to touch.On especially for L contracts is we have.This giant test Suites folder we use.A lot of this for all of the integration.Testing so for example there is a test.Fixture this basically just contains.A whole it's it's basically going to.Deploy from a fresh environment a whole.Bunch of contracts and things that exist.To basically support a pretty standard.Blend pool so you'll notice it's.Going to make tokens it adds a whole.Bunch of users it deploys all the.Contracts out for you and you can.Basically then start from a really good.Starting point to actually write an.Integration level test one quick.Thing to note here is that if you ever.See an our test the user Bombadil .I'm a bit of a Lord of the Rings nerd so.He is the admin and ruler of everything.So he has the power to basically mint.Tokens at will he's kind of the.Admin the super key for roughly all of.Our tests as well but how this is.Actually implemented you'll actually.Notice if you look back at some of our.Older audits we've written.Integration tests after after basically.Fixing issues that have been found .One of these was an inflation attack.That I believe C Tor found in the.First audit but for example this kind.Of walks you through a really good way.If you think something does exist that.Might have an issue writing one of.These level tests is a really really.Good way to actually prove whether or.Not it exists since this kind of is.What at at this level of test this.Really is the place where you're going.To have the same level of interaction .That someone using the blockchain.Would then yeah maybe the last thing.To note before I switch over to the fev.VA here is you'll notice on the test.Test fixture when you cre the test.Picture there's a true false just so.It's clear you have the ability when.Running rust integration tests to.Actually deploy the contracts and use.WMS so if you want to use the actual.Wasm files that are being deployed .That's great we do that in plenty of.Tests but if you do that rust.Itself won't actually be able to debug.The code within the wasin packages so if.You're expecting some of the prit lines.Or line by line de debugging to.Work you will need to deploy all of the.Contracts as rust crates that way you.Can use all the unit testing.Tools so yeah that's probably all I'm.Going to touch on here again within.Test Suites and test this is tons of.Really good examples on setting up all.Different kinds of environments if.You want to go through and attempt to.Prove that something is.Incorrect lastly I'm going to also.Run through the Fe Vault contract .This.Is basically a add-on contract that's.Aimed at wallets that will allow.Users to specify either a fixed rate of.Return or excuse me a CAP rate of.Return so for example if a wallet wanted.To offer say 10% on usdc deposits.Using blend they can deploy one of these.Fe volts if the blend pools returning.More than 10% they would keep that extra.Say it's returning 15% they would keep.5% 10% would go to the users or they.Can just take a fixed interest take off.Of all of the interest generated for.Deposits through this Fe volt so it.It works pretty similar similarly to any..Er ERC 4626 function or 4626 Vault.Token so those that are familiar or.I've looked at those those kinds of.Protocols in the past this should.Feel somewhat familiar to you I did.Want to call out one thing you'll also.Notice some of the implementation.Patterns we use in blend also come over.Here so the only thing that's maybe a.Bit different is this contracts a bit.Simpler so you you'll notice we've kind.Of there's probably one less layer of.Abstraction there for you to have to.Deal with most things are documented.Pretty well in code but if you find.Anything please please feel free to call.It out you'll notice that in the test.Here it's set up a bit differently so.For example this is a very long test.But we we we mainly are testing the fee.VA through integration testing since.The contct is a bit similar simpler and.It relies heavily on the blend the blend.Contracts themselves so you'll notice.That we we support a blend rust crate. that includes all of the blend.Contracts themselves this has been.Updated for the exact hash that was.Pushed for the Auto competition so.You'll notice that I.Believe yeah the version is.Here but this comes with a very.Similar deployment script as the one we.Use within the blend contracts.Repository for their integration test so. let's see if yeah there's a blend.Flixer deploy function that will.Actually go ahead and create all of the.Blend contracts needed to interact with. a very similar setup as to what blend.View1 main it is so if you do run.Into anything with the F VA this is.Kind of a great place to look to go.Ahead and try and prove that something.INF fact is missing or has a bug. so yeah that's probably all I wanted.To touch on I wanted to make sure I left.A little bit of time for Sor to go.Through the formal verification portion.Of the auto competition. but I'll probably leave it there.Unless there's anything else you want me.To touch on Carson great let's .Let's wait and see if there's any.Questions at the end but thank you.For the presentation I'm going to invite.Shandon Armen on the.Stage welcome both of.You.Hi Armen are you there okay yep hello. you have my screen.So this is the contest.Repo so trra you can let me know yeah.We should walk over sure yeah you can.Share and I'll I'll just go over it so. as Alex mentioned in his .Presentation before you know we are.Doing this audit and formal verification.Contest for blend and while the audit.Itself you can you know all all of the.Prog the code bases in scope for the.Verification part we have a smaller.Scope because the the protocol is.There's a lot of code and so we decided.That it would be more tractable and.Manageable if we tried to focus on one.Particular part and in particular we are.Looking at the back stop crate so if you. go up a little bit in this .Repository so for what it's worth this.Is the repository where all the code is.So you can clone this repository and.Then you can .Check out all the different crates and.In particular the one that we are.Talking about is the back stop as you.Can see Armen has it here and I want.To show the Sora specific stuff so first.Of all the the the properties that.You're going to be writing are going to.Be in the seras specs directory where.Armen is right now I think I have a.Couple of little so well now can you.Go maybe look at some of the other files.There's a few that I provided just.For an example yeah so here's a few.Examples of things that you just to.Give you an idea for what these look.Like and so you can notice here.That there is this thing called cvlr.Uncore assert in all the rules and so.The things that are so that's one .Thing I want to talk about a little bit.So if you look at line number five this.Is the we we call it Cavalier so.Cavaliere is the specification language.That we've built it's just a rust.Library so you can import the library.And then you can use the various.Assertions and there which are just.Macros that we've defined so.Assume assert and satisfy I think are.Probably the most common ones and the.Ones that are I think we recommend using. the most if you need something more.Specific then you can always reach.Out and we can help you figure out.How to how to do.That the other thing worth noting.Here is can you can Arman can you.Go down to the the cargo Tomo file at.The bottom. yes so we are also relying on. rust features so for example here you.Can see on line 17 there's this feature.Called.Cur and the nice thing about this .This mechanism is it actually lets you.Use this feature to selectively .Compile the code so for example .You can if you go back Armen to let's.See let's go in the back stop yeah.And maybe in the.Withdrawal maybe go to deposit.Actually okay perfect so if you look at.The top of this file you'll see that .We are using this feature called sora.And essentially what this is saying is.That when the feature is enabled and I.Just showed you before that in the cargo.TL it is enabled then use this mock.Implementation of the token client and.Otherwise you can use the whatever.Default one that blend was using and.This is just for verification only right.So when you're compiling your code for. other purposes then you shouldn't be.Using this but when you're doing.Verification this is helpful because a.Lot of the times we want to modularize.Things and so you may not need to.Include all the code for the token when.You're really just verifying the code .For the back stop right so that's an.Interesting feature that I think you'll.Probably use quite a bit and you know.Always feel free to reach out on.Discord if you have any questions the.Other thing I also want to highlight is. the con files so on the left you will.See that there is this directory called.Conss and here we have provided some.Setup and some skeleton for some basic.Conss so let's look at the one yeah the.Withdraw one is a good one so what's.Happening here is we have this .File that has a a build script this is.Already provided you probably should not.Have to modify this at all it's just.A python script that does a bunch of.Stuff that is necessary for making sure.That the reports look nice you know you.Have all the files uploaded there it.Calls the right build instruction in.This case we're using this file.Called this build system called just. but other than you should not have to.Modify that more or less then there's.A few verification specific things so.For example there's this thing called we.Have this slide called optimistic.Loop we we don't need to worry.About what that is I would leave that.There there's also this precise.Bitwise Ops flag which is set to True. what this is saying is that when.You're doing the verification use bit.Vectors you may or may not want it .It's you can if you're facing like.Slow running times I recommend taking it.Out and seeing what happens and again if.You run into any issues when you take.It out you can reach out and we'll try.To help you. and then really the main thing you.Will have to modify is this rules field.So whatever rules you write you just.Have to add them to this file and then.You just run this San with this.Configuration file I one thing I.Would recommend so it is very common for.Users to run the prover with many ruls.And that is what you will do in the end.But when you're debugging and when.You're just you know trying to test.Things out it is often helpful to just.Run one rule at a time so you know which.Rule is problematic or you know which.Has a Vu problem or all kinds of stuff.Right so definitely keep that in mind.When you're just getting started and.You know writing these as as I can.Tell you there's a lot of excitement.Already on Discord lots of people have.Been asking lots of questions really.Good questions so it's already really.Nice to see the the engagement from the.The community so that's that's really.Cool so I think let me just think.What else I would like to show actually.Yes can you Armen if you click on.The documentation page that you have.Open so yeah here we have some.Documentation for using Sunbeam so.There's the installation guide which I.Think you probably don't need to worry.Too much about if you if you if you have.Installed ctra CLI you should be you.Should be good to go so I don't think.You need anything else so the user guide.Is the main thing you know we have.Some examples of you know what the.Different components are so for example.Here you know you see this like hash.Rule thing on top of these functions.So really what's Happening Here is.You're just writing rust functions right.So Cura is like interpreting those.Functions separately especially for.Verification but from your point of view.You're just writing rust functions with.Special macros and special annotation so. that's one of the annotations is this.Rule attribute. and I already mentioned the CVL.Assume assert macros from the Cavalier.Spec Library another thing that is very.Useful is this notion of.Non-determinism so oftentimes what.Happens is when you're doing.Verification you might want to .Sort of summarize some piece of code.Because you know maybe that's not super.Relevant for the property you're.Verifying and all you care about is that.That function returns some.Non-deterministic value right it could.Be a u64 it could be i1 128 whatever .It could be a user defined type all.Kinds of Stu so this nonb gives you a.Mechanism to do that so Cavalier.Actually already implements a bunch of.Non-ets for various primitive types. blend has a lot of userdefined.Structs right so for example there's the.Q4 Q4 withdrawal struct you.Might want to implement that. trade for this this truck right.So you can do it this way so right like.As there's an example here so.Essentially all you do is you know.You assign non- debt to all the fields.Of the struct and you're good to go.So this is something that's really.Helpful for for verification we.Often have to do it and I'm imagining.Other people will have to do this as.Well we have some very basic examples in.The tutorial so we have a Sunbeam.Tutorial over over here. it gives an example of the token.Contract so if you've never done.Verification I think this is a good way.To start you can just do the exercises.Here and you know just try to.Understand like what what's really.Happening when you run the tool and.So.On and other than that if you go.Back I think I already explained the.Scripts the build script stuff if you.Scroll down a little bit more.Armen yeah I think they these are.Already covered.Say so I think the main other thing I.Would recommend looking at is what.Happens when you do run Sunbeam so as I.Mentioned before and it's actually also. listed in the readme for the the repo.All you do is you just run Cur San.Proofer and you pass this Con file and.You you run it and all you get is a.Link to a run right and this link is.Going to look something like this right.So here you can see well so here.There is no violation so you're fine but.If there is a violation you can see a.Call Trace the call Trace is not super. easy to read so if you are stuck with.Problems with the call Trace please post.Messages on Discord and we'll try to.Help you as much as possible you can.Also see the code right so for example.Here on the left you have this files you.Can see all the files that you used to.Run verification all the properties that.You ran all the code that you changed or.Properties you wrote everything is here. so and I would always encourage you.To if you are having any problems you.Can just send me a link to a run and.Then I can take a look at the run I can.Reproduce the Run locally and and help.You debug your.Problems. other than that I'm not thinking.What else would be useful. I think about that's that might be.All I have like oh actually I would.Like to mention one other thing.So we already saw the feature CRA.Feature of mechanism where you can.Selectively decide what functions to.Include when you're compiling we also.Saw the non-dead macro another thing.That you may have to do is summarize.Various functions so this is something.That you know for example here the.Way the best way to do this is the.Following right so in the C specs.Directory you there is a directory.Called summaries and in there you can .So the mod is that's where you just.Expose all the summaries that you have.Written so here there's you know this.File called emissions and in emissions.It's possible that depending on the.Property you're proving you might have.To summarize right so for example you.Can say that I don't really care what.Emissions does as long as it's returning.A Nonet terministic value or you can.That well it should be a.Nondeterministic value but maybe it.Should be in some range so this kind of.Stuff right like it really depends on.Your understanding of protocol and like.What you think is necessary for .Whoever is calling this function to know.About this function Behavior right so.This is actually often very helpful so.You can put all your summaries here and.Then wherever you're calling the.Function instead of calling the original.Function you just call this function and. it would be really good if you.Actually annotate it with this because.Then you know you're not really changing.The semantics of the original program. great I think we need to wrap it up.Here but thank you so much for for.This presentation I think this was .Very helpful for everyone who's going to.Participate in the in the competition to.Get to walk through both of the code and.And and and the verification here so.Thank you all for joining I didn't.See any questions in the chat but yeah.Feel free to reach out also in.Discord if there's anything I'll post.The link again in Discord for the.Competition so good luck to everyone .The competition is running until March.17th so still have plenty of time to to.Dig into it thank you everyone for.Joining thank you Shandra and Alex for.For joining here us thank you everyone.Thanks everybody.
