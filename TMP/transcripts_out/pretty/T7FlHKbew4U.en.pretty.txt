All righty welcome to another episode of.Engineering talks my name is tyler van.Der Hooven and I'm gonna be talking.Today about a preset proposal for.Turing-complete smart contracts for.Stellar precept simply means that this.Is just some work that I've been doing.On a Stellar ecosystem proposal around.This idea of turing-complete contracts.And we're going to talk a lot about that.Today obviously that's what the talk is.All about but it's important to kind of.Reset your thinking a little bit we all.Have an idea of what turing-complete or.Smart contracts means I'm gonna try and.Come into this without too much baggage.And explain what I mean a bit along the.Way and I'm going to be using.Aetherium as our comparison project.Because most of us when we think of.Smart contracts have etherium in mind so.This is not necessarily a competition.Against etherium it's simply a.Comparison of features that if this SEP.Were accepted and used how would you how.You would accomplish similar sorts of.Things that you could on etherium on on.Stellar and comparing the.Functionalities and features that.Aetherium offers with what this Turing.Signing server SEP would allow you to.Accomplish on Stellar so let's let's.Dive in today's gonna be a bit technical.We're gonna go through Trent blazed.Through these slides pretty quick and.Then get into some examples and encode.But it will be a little bit longer.Probably than we're used to for these.Engineering talks to stick with me it is.Quite interesting super excited I've.Spent a lot of time thinking and working.On this problem myself as something that.I very much need in my own development.And I think would really benefit the.Stellar community at large all right so.The problem is if the room has market.Dominance in an arena we're better.Suited to serve namely Finance so we.Have assets and the ability to have.Assets as first-class citizens where.There.In an account but often times financial.Architecture will be built in aetherium.In instances where oftentimes it would.Be better to have that built in.Stellar's it's going to be faster.Cheaper and you're going to have this.Capabilities and functionalities that.Are native in aetherium and you'll have.To kind of custom build that yourself.Whereas in Stellar they will often be.Built in kind of at the base layer so.Our solution ears to appeal to aetherium.Developers by bringing functional.Feature parity and that's a key phrase.Here functional feature parity this.Isn't feature parity it's functional so.What you can accomplish in etherium.Trying to allow that same type of.Functionality in Stellar in the in the.Financial arena and so the solution.There for me the product there for me I.Guess is smart contracts now we have a.Concept of smart contracts and seller.It's kind of using operations and this.Nature of Stellar transactions you can.Accomplish a lot of different things.Atomically inside of a transaction so.You can have lots of different.Operations that open things up and close.Things off all within the same.Transaction you don't have to do a bunch.Of individual things and then who knows.What's going to happen inside because.Lots of things can happen in a single.Ledger you can accomplish a lot of very.Intelligent smart things and by using.Things like time bounds or pre assigned.Transactions you can get away with a lot.Of I would say complex big business.Logic and we've sort of slapped some our.Contracts on to that but in no way is.That what most of the world thinks of at.Least most of the blockchain world.Thinks of when they think of smart.Contracts smart contracts as a concept.Is very different than what we tend to.Talk about when we talk about Stellar.Smart contracts today so we're gonna be.Moving away from what most of us think.Of when we think of Stellar smart.Contracts and moving much closer to what.Aetherium means when it says smart.Contracts so my definition is a smart.Contract as the ecosystem understands it.So regardless of what wikipedia says the.Smart contract is the way that smart.Contract the word phrase is used as the.Ecosystem at large the blockchain.Ecosystem understands it is an arbitrary.Turing-complete program it's.In complete programming executed on a.Decentralized network for the purpose of.Minimizing trust so you have this idea.Of a program that has arbitrary.Programming that does who knows what.That accomplishes some sort of goal and.That goal is better accomplished when.It's trust minimized or there isn't a.Lot of third-party trust involved or.It's decentralized and this is this is.Important to kind of for all of us to.Agree even if you don't necessarily.Agree with me on this that this is where.I'm coming from when I talk about the.Smart contracts that I'm envisioning.Through this SEP that I'm building is.This idea of trust minimize minimizing.Trust so there will still be trust.Involved there's always trust involved.It's just who and how much and what are.Those parties that you're trusting and.Then arbitrator and complete programming.The ability to do kind of any sort of.Logic that you need to to to create some.Sort of output instead you don't have.That Stellar is not turing-complete that.Allows it to be very fast and flexible.In scale very quickly whereas an.Aetherium those things are bundled.Together where you have what we'll get.To in a minute the idea of transaction.Creation creation and execution so what.Does that really mean was this ecosystem.Doing with smart contracts there are two.Things when it comes to financial smart.Contracts there's transaction creation.And transaction execution so building.Blockchain mutations basically these are.The instructions for how I want to.Change the ledger how I want to mutate.The existing state of the ledger or.Blockchain by adding another block and.Then also the transaction execution.Which takes those instructions takes.Those mutations and actually runs them.To perform the changes so you have the.Instructions and the execution the.Creation in the execution so we have.That right in Stellar and a theorem you.Can both create transactions and execute.Transactions both in Stellar and.Aetherium so what's the big deal how how.Is what's the problem well the problem.Is decentralization.In Stellar there is no decentralized.Transaction create.Atheria m-- there is because in the.Virtual machines that run aetherium.Those are run all over the world anybody.That's running an ethereal node and.Participating in the consensus the.Transaction creation and execution both.Happen in that process of arriving at.Consensus whereas in Stellar only the.Execution of the transaction the.Creation of that transaction happens.Outside of the execution so you sort of.Give it very detailed in permissible.Instructions and then send it to the.Consensus protocol to actually execute.That in aetherium you send a very.Minimum information and then both the.Creation and execution because assets.Are not first-class citizens you can.Build a whole program that will handle.The kind of input that anybody might.Send it and then the ledger for your.Particular smart contract will be.Updated so both of those things happen.The same time it would be one of the.Reasons that if your iam is built the.Way that it is and why some of the.Reasons or ways that it differs from.Something like Stellar which what I'm.Going to get into that too deeply and I.Honestly don't understand it perfectly.But with my new this set proposal that.I've been working on we're gonna look at.Today we're looking at adding.Decentralized transaction creation so.Smart contracts do not execute this is.Really important it very something is.Very different than aetherium all that.On adding or proposing that we add.Through this step is transact.Decentralized transaction creation which.We will then tag on to the existing.Architecture we already have within.Stellar the decentralized transaction.Execution which would give us through.This what I'm tagging is SEP acts if we.Add seller and this new sub X together.We get feature functional feature parity.With aetherium where we have.Decentralized transaction creation and.Decentralized transaction execution.Which would be amazing.And we'll get to why hopefully maybe.Some of your wheels are starting to turn.On what decentralized transaction.Creation would allow us to do some of.The things that it would allow us to.Accomplish which we cannot do now but.We'll we'll get into that so essentially.Sub X is Turing signing servers.Decentralized turing-complete.Trying.Action creation so a few weeks ago we.Had a engineering talk on Sept 30 which.Is the key recovery servers and we have.Federation servers as well so we have.This concept within solar ecosystem.Proposals of external servers or.Services which run to provide sort of.Additional logic or additional.Functionality common additional.Functionality across the ecosystem and.So this would be an additional server.That would be running the individuals or.Enterprises would run which would allow.This decentralized turing-complete.Transaction creation where you have.These multiple parties running something.Which will accomplish some goal in a.Decentralized way so still the smart.Contracts via sip X have three entities.They have users contract creators and.Turing server so some of these may be.Blurred at times the line between the.Two but they are distinct in the sense.That regardless of whether they end up.Being the same entity or individual they.Will be serving three separate purposes.So users submit transactions for final.Execution the final there the final.Interested party they have something.That they want to do something that they.Want to accomplish and they interface.With touring servers but it's typically.Transacting through a contract not the.Turing server so they'll be contracts.That users interact with and those.Contracts are hosted on the Turing.Servers so I will interact with a.Contract which is hosted on multiple.Turing servers and then there are.Contract creators obviously who create.The contracts and either provide.Services or just innocuous features so.We'll get to some of those in a minute.But a contract creator doesn't.Necessarily have to be some sort of.Service provider they can just build a.Contract that anyone can implement and.Use to provide some additional.Decentralized functionality and so I.Have a diagram here which is 100%.Useless so we are going to break that.Down user wants to interact with a.Contract creator for the service.Right there providing save users and.Contract creators we have this concept.Already today where you have some third.Party that you're wanting to interact.With with your Stellar address whether.You're making a payment or you want to.Provide some sort of functionality with.Some sort of functionality of the.Service providers offering and you have.A very one-to-one relationship you send.Instructions or requests you interact.With their UI and they send you back.Responses whether that sign this.Transaction or add this trust line or.Whatever that interaction might be it's.Very much one-to-one and this is where.Some of the issues are going to arrive.This is unacceptable as a requirement.Oftentimes this will be fine but I think.It's not the right thing to say this is.The way it has to be right so it's.Unacceptable as a requirement as it.Leaves the user trusting a single entity.And a contract creator liable for a high.Level of responsibility and involvement.And ultimately it's not decentralized.You could add more servers but.Ultimately the contract creator is.Controlling all of those servers and.Decentralization like at its core is.Mitigating trust or taking that trust.And splitting it amongst multiple.Parties so that no one entity controls.Everything we split that up to where.There's a level of trust because no one.Entity is the single trusted entity and.So we are getting to that diagram I.Showed a little bit before we get we.Introduced if they're disinterested but.Incentivized third party service the.Turing signing server which will act as.A permission request arbitrator between.Users and contract creators to the.Server we upload a strict specific.Turing-complete program or smart.Contract which will create transactions.They don't execute they create.Transactions so the contract creator.Will build a program which will create.Outputs it's basically just in in this.In my case it's going to be a lambda.Function but ultimately it's just an API.Endpoint which when called takes an.Input and then outputs a valid.Transaction Stellar transaction and then.The Turing signing server as you can see.Here stores contracts and holds keys and.Those keys are seller keys which.Sign for the transaction that the.Contract generates and in Stellar we.Have this concept the reason this works.Or is valuable is because in Stellar we.Have the concept of multi-sig where.You've got multiple signers which can be.Added to accounts and can sign for any.Transaction that's being originating or.Originates from that account so if I.Want to make a payment I can sign with.My key or I can sign with somebody.Else's key if they've been added as a.Signer to my account and so as we start.To we create this contract and we.Uploaded to a turing signing server when.We upload it a signing key is sent back.To us and that signing key is what we.Upload to our contract we add that.Signature to our contract or we gave it.To our user to add to their accounts so.That we can sign for some action off of.Off of their account now when we have.Just one Turing signing server we're.Going to see that doesn't get us any.Improvements but it's the duplicity the.Lots of Turing signing servers where we.Start to see the power come out but this.Allows for transactions and their.Signatures to be generated following the.Strictness of a codified contract rather.Than the trust of a contract creator.Entity and this is this is the big point.Here that's may seem a little bit.Abstract but it's it's really powerful.Because if I want to if I want to do.Something let's say I want under very.Strict specific circumstances I want you.To be able to use my account to pay.Yourself a hundred dollars you know if.If some parameter is met I can't ever.Give you my secret key because if I give.You that you can do much much more than.Just pay yourself a hundred dollars so.How can I give you access to my account.Without giving you complete access to my.Account it's only strict specific.Turing-complete access to my account.Well I get that through this contract.Creation where I upload a contract to a.Turing signing server and then you.Interact with that Turing signing server.And rather than you having access to the.Secret seed you have access to only.Perfectly signed transactions from those.Turning signing servers so I don't give.You a secret key I give you signed.Transactions through these Turing.Signing servers and then you can.Interact with the Turing signing servers.Rather than directly with my account and.That's that's kind of one example but.Hopefully that starts to make sense.So the reason this becomes or how this.Becomes decentralized is we upload these.Contracts to lots of different Turing.Signing servers so it's the same.Contract across lots of different Turing.Signing servers and then through.Thresholds right so we're out of T.Signers multi-sig to accounts but each.Of those can have a threshold so I can.Say to make a payment you need a.Threshold of three so I need at least a.Weight of three to be able to make a.Payment and so when I upload all this.Same contract all of these turns signing.Servers they all send me back a key.Which I add to my account as signers but.Only with a weight of one so that no one.Turing signing server not even two.Turing signing servers could sign for or.Collude to do something with my account.You would need at least three and.Through thresholds you can add any.Number of I guess up to 20 thresholds to.Agree very complex secure logic to.Account for whatever kind of logic.You're trying to perform with your.Contract but essentially you're just.Going to upload this to a number of.Turing signing servers and then through.Thresholds decide how many of those.Turing signing servers need to add their.Signature to the transaction that's.Being requested and because it's the.Same contract it's producing the same.Transaction the same XDR and if any one.Of these gets a little sneaky and tries.To you know make a payment to themself.They would change the XDR and therefore.The signature for all the other turing.Signing servers would be invalid if the.Requests that the user is making to the.Turning signing servers is different.Than any of the others it will be.Rejected.It'll be spat out because it doesn't.Match any of the others and the.Signature therefore would be invalid.When it finally comes to submission time.And so now the contract creator is a.Nonentity.They no longer really interact with the.User the user interacts directly with.The Turing signing server so contract.Creators don't even need to at this.Point run a server they just uploaded.Some arbitrary JavaScript logic or.Really any programming logic language.Logic to these Turing signing servers.And so long as it's valid and producing.Good transactions and being used and not.Being nefarious the user can interact.With Turing signing servers completely.Separate from the contract creator in a.Decentralized manner getting.Transactions which follow the pattern.That the contract creator allowed for.Because they've added their signature to.It and in this case following our.Example before the user can begin.Interacting and making payments to.Themselves for $100 so long as it.Follows the pattern that the contract.Creator allowed for so hopefully it's.Starting to make sense.Turning signing servers allow for secure.Signing through programmable contracts.So again we need to we need to remember.That Turing signing servers their goal.Is to create transactions not to submit.Them so they they perform the business.Of creating a valid signed transaction.And that signing doesn't have to be and.Often I would say is not complete it's.Partial signing it's signing for some of.The logic of the transaction that was.Performed but there's probably should be.Some piece that's left to the user.Whether that's paying the base fee.Whether that's in a you know a vending.Machine example you have to pay a.Hundred lumens to get a hundred of your.Asset back like Ana ICO model or some.Sort of token giveaway or there's lots.Of different instances where you're the.User is going to be the final signer and.So the transaction that comes back is.Signed and it's signed enough for all.The interaction that deals with the.Contract creators account but there's.Still some piece that's left for the.User account so it's just adding.Signatures to a transaction but not.Necessarily fully signed although that.Obviously could be again the business.Logic appears in the contract not in the.XDR.Itself not in the Stellar transaction.Itself so you can create all kinds of.Business logic that produces a.Transaction at the end of the day that.Could be any sort of thing and that's.Kind of what we're gonna look look.Through here now so again like the motto.For this is you get what you permit so.When you start talking about could I do.This or could this be used in this case.The answer is going to long as is.Related to like seller transactions and.Getting a payment and kind of really.Getting access to your account through a.Secure contract like so long as that's.The question the answer is yes because.So long as you create the right.Permissions it's you can allow for it.You can build for something like that.Amazing the houses compared to etherium.Smart contracts will just look through.This really quick so now with this FX.Would have along with the 3m.Decentralized transaction execution and.Then the difference here arguably is.Going to be again the safety over.Liveness that we have within the.Selection since it's protocol versus if.You're in virtual machines anyway where.The safety aspect to the contract.Control is it's just creating.Transactions it's not actually executing.Them and so you don't have to.Necessarily worry about your accounts or.About the safety of your account so long.As you've built your contract correctly.And then the liveness aspect of it is.Going to come down to how well did you.Write your contract is your account.Funded all the things that are already.Limitations just within Stellar versus.The ethereal model which is once you.Upload a contract there's nothing you.Can do to really alter that because both.Transaction creation and execution are.Happening at the same time but that.Contract will always exist it will.Always be up unless you have some of.Those non decentralized back doors open.So some of the core philosophical design.Differences Stellar smart contracts.Nothing unacceptable can happen in a.Favor smart contracts nothing unexpected.Can happen and there's benefits on both.Sides really depends on what you're.Trying to build for those Stellar smart.Contracts because that is just.Generating a transaction the final.Execution is in the hands of.Whoever the final user is whereas in.Aetherium smart contracts the final.Execution is in the hands of the.Contract so you you execute it hoping.That it does what you expect whereas.With a social on card track you execute.It and then it spits out a final.Transaction which you have a final say.And whether or not you want to submit it.So finally the thing that we were all.Looking forward to examples and I think.Yes that is pretty much my last slide.I'm going to switch now to my browser.I'm going to open I've got some glitch.Demos here so fantastic little service.Here glitch and I'm going to open up all.Of these examples and then make this a.Little bit bigger so the first one I'd.Like to look at is a very basic kind of.Run-of-the-mill vending machine example.So when we talk about smart contracts.Vending machines kind of a really good.Starting point where you give it an.Input and it gives a guaranteed output.So in this case we're running a Tyler.Coin trade or swap where you send in a.Hundred lumens and you get a hundred.Tyler coin back or it's always a.One-to-one so if you did 50 it'd be 50.If you'd tend to be 10 so I've got an.Account here so if I can open this I've.Got an account here which I am making a.Payment tune and this is just a standard.Seller account that I've funded with.Friend bot there's nothing fancy that's.Been added to this there's a contract.Though that I've uploaded that says all.The logic around when a transaction come.Or when a request comes in to this.Contract take a hundred lumens make a.Operation for taking a hundred lumens.From this account and then send it ten.All right send it ten top corner 100 for.101 to one and so we'll give it that.Hundred and then we'll generate the XDR.So let me just pop in the code for this.Real quick.We make that a little bigger so this.Would be our vending machine smart.Contract so essentially there's a.Contract that says when a request comes.In and it has source and amount we're.Just going to build a Stellar.Transaction and then spit out the xgr.And that's going to be a payment for 100.Lumens to me and then send back tot it.Going to the source account which is the.Account that we add right here and then.It also adds the fee payment to the.Turrets so to the Turing signing servers.So Turing signing servers again I.Mentioned that they are disinterested.But incentivize third parties they have.No benefit to get from collusion but.They have benefit to get from collecting.On fees so if you run a Turing signing.Server you can charge fees to execute.These contracts as well as upload.Contracts so transact servers have a.Business opportunity but they're just.Interested in the sense that they don't.Care what contracts are being run so.This is a very I mean 57 lines of code.Plus comments so very very small little.Contract but it does allow arbitrary.Logic and it allows me to safely say I.Can run an entire contract here of.Paying out my Tyler coin in exchange for.Xlm all through just this very basic.JavaScript code so I'm going to upload.This when I upload this contract to a.Turing signing server they are going to.Send back a signing key because this is.The account this is the contract address.That is going to be paying out Tyler.Coin if we look this up in still our.Experts on the test net we will see the.Windows condemn when we upload it to the.Turing signing servers they send back.Signing keys and those signing keys are.What we add to this contract to allow.For these contracts to actually generate.Signed transactions because the Turing.Signing server is going to generate an.XDR and then add a signature using.Whichever signing key they have for that.Contract and then we have a threshold of.Three like I mentioned before so if.Three so long as three addresses sign.Off on this any any transactions coming.From this contract we can generate a.Valid signature and the execution the.Transaction will go through in this case.Paying out toilet claim so let's go back.Here and generate that xtr that generate.XE our button is going to call the.Turing signing servers it's going to say.Hey this account would like to generate.An ex TR and it looks like we have got a.Beautiful error so you know so is the.Way it goes.But essentially what would have happened.If it had worked would be the the.Contract goes out to all of those.Different addresses all those different.Turing signing server sends back the.Same XDR with the signature the.Signatures get added to the transaction.That comes in we add our final signature.To the ex TR to the transaction and then.We can submit it right so we have to we.Have we have this account we would have.To sign for for that hundred lumen.Payment it pays out the hundred lumens.And then the signatures that we received.From the Turing signing servers for the.Tyler coin are all valid all the.Signatures are there we can make this.Relatively complex payment all through a.Very simple Turing signing server smart.Contract so that would be our vending.Machine example the next one would be.Let's do this weather coin so this one.Kind of showcases but I would call.Oracle eyes data but really it's just.Taking a third party API and using that.Information to generate a transactions a.Different transaction or our variable.Transaction so in this case we are using.The dark sky API we are looking up the.Weather at my current location and if.It's raining we are going to generate a.Transaction for rain coin and if it's.Sunny outside we're gonna generate a.Transaction that pays out Sun coin and.So again we need the same address when I.Upload this the same thing happens each.Sharing sighting server sends back a.Different a new signing key we had that.Signing key to the contract.And then the contract when we call it.Will generate signatures for this.Particular transaction so hopefully this.One will work it's not raining at my.House at the moment so unfortunately you.Can't get a any rain coin so in this.Case it's looking it up and it's saying.Because it's raining we're not going to.Be able to get any any rain coin so if.It was raining you'd be able to get rain.Coin but because it's not theirs.I think there's logic actually running.In the glitch app which says if it's not.Raining don't generate the XDR so maybe.A little bit of a letdown but still you.Can provide arbitrary logic to say.Because it's not raining in my house.Right now we're going to spit out and.Reject this transaction which is really.Cool because you allow that logic to say.I'm going to give away like usage of my.Account but only under certain.Parameters and in this case it's an.Arbitrary third party API which is.Providing the information that's as well.It's not raining and so because it's not.Raining we're not going to generate a.Transaction we're not going to add a.Signature for it.We're throwing that out which is which.Is cool the next one would be the filter.Smart contract and this one's actually a.Little bit different because instead of.Adding signatures to a contract address.We're actually adding signatures to an.Account to a user's account and this is.One of those examples where a contract.The ones we've looked at so far have.Been sort of third party services so.Somebody's actually trying to run a.Business off of smart contracts in this.Case somebody just created a random you.Know open source smart contract which.Provides filtering functionality and so.Maybe I have an account that I want to.Give access to someone for but only if.They're xlm payments are below a hundred.Lumens so I've made a filter smart.Contract here which basically says when.A transaction comes in so the input here.Is actually in xtr so we're going to.Generate a Steller's transaction which.Has to have just one operation which is.A payment and it has to be an amount.That is less than 100.Because if it's great greater than 100.Lumens the request will be rejected but.In this case we actually want to attach.This contract to a user's account not to.A contract account so there isn't really.A contract address here somebody's just.Created this contract and says hey I'm.Gonna upload this and if you would like.To use it if you would like to get this.Filtering functionality for your account.Then you just need to add the signing.Keys to your address so if we take this.Xtr here which is a valid example we can.Look up the account that it's attached.To so we've added the signing keys to.This account and right now there's just.Two so we've uploaded this contract to.Tutoring servers taking their signing.Keys and attach them to our account we.Have a threshold of 3 which means we.Need all three of these both turning.Signing servers and then our own TFI.Signing key to sign off on and then we.Kind of have this escape base64 or.Sha-256 hash that if something terrible.Happens and we need to rescue this.Account we kind of have that in our back.Pocket that's not a turning signing.Server thing that's just good practice.If you've kind of locked out your.Account to yourself but anyway sharing.Signing servers are going to sign for.Two so by themselves these turning.Saying servers can't do anything there's.No collusion capability possibility.Because at most they would only have a.Weight of two which isn't enough to do.Anything they would they would need that.Final signer my sign my signature to.Actually do anything so however I can't.Also by myself do anything this account.Is useless on its own it needs those.Other tutoring signing servers to.Actually accomplish anything and those.Turning signing servers are locked in to.Only signing for this which is that the.Transaction is greater than or is less.Than 100 limits so if we go back here we.Can see this payment is for 100 xlm so.If we go and we generate the xtr on this.All of my examples are.Today this is not fantastic and we try.The invalid one it works it doesn't it.Filters a transaction here looks like.This one's not working I think I may.Have uploaded the beta X beta.Let me look real quick at the contract.Address and make sure I'm actually using.The right contractors because this one.Is kind of cool so we edit our project.Real quick in our JavaScript know it's.Got the right one yeah who knows.Probably shouldn't have fooled with it.Too much before before doing the demo.But anyway if you had a valid example.Which we this is valid X er but looks.Like something's up with my Turing.Signing servers this would be valid it.Would be signed you could view it in the.Laboratory and then submit the.Transaction to the network so long as it.Was under that hundred one more example.Here this on glitch is our hourly wager.Demo so I play video games occasionally.And on Fridays will do wager pools so.Maybe like you know 10 lumens or 20.Bucks or something like that and there.That all gets pulled together and.Whoever wins the game.Gets the gets the pool you could also.See it as a donation pool where or even.Like a Kickstarter or something where if.If balance reaches over a certain.Threshold and the money's released.There's lots of different smart contract.Logic that comes through these types of.Functionalities but you don't want a.Single entity holding all those funds.With the risk that they could run away.And so you might add multiple human.Signers to that but if one of them gets.Bitter and doesn't want to do the thing.That you you know I go you cheated and.It's I'm not going to sign off on this.Transaction where you could run it to.Issues when you have those human.Variables but if it's just machines and.They're just following contract logic.You remove that layer that risk.And do the the perform that trust.Minimized aspect of things which is.Really what we're after and what turning.Signing servers exists for and so in.This case you have a contract address.Which has the Turing sang service been.Uploaded to all of the turning signing.Servers with threshold of three again so.You need at least three of these Turing.Signing servers and then individuals.Will start to pay this account you can.See the payments coming into this.Account into the wager pool and then in.This case every hour the contract will.Go through you'll be able to generate an.Xgr which will pick at random one of.These individuals as the winner and.Payout the pool.Payout the pool to them so again if we.Go to our arrow the wager contract it's.A little bit longer contract but not.Really still 100 lines where it takes.Into account the operations for this.Contract account looking at the payments.And then we'll randomly select one of.Those as a winner every hour so those.Are examples in that case again you.Upload the signers in this case to the.Contract like we did before the last one.That I think is really interesting is a.Recurring revenue model so one of the.Issues right now with recurring revenue.Models on Stellar is that you have to.Pre sign loads of transactions and kind.Of bump sequence numbers and it gets.Quite hairy when it actually comes time.To execute those as they have to give to.Pre sign loads of transactions.Especially if it's like shorter terms on.Weekly or monthly basis and you have a.Lot of these transactions just kind of.Sitting around hoping that they'll be.Valid valid whenever it comes time to.Submit them with Turing signing servers.You can create a contract which takes.Into account when a payment when a.Payment was last made and for how much.It was when it was made all the.Information around the actual payment.And then if it's time if it's been a.Month since the last payment you can.Make another payment and so essentially.You would create this transaction much.Like the filter transaction or much like.The filter contract you upload this.Contract add the signers to a user.Account but.Those signers can only sign through this.Contract and so if it's been a month.Since the last payment was made you can.Call this contract and it will generate.A transaction which makes a thousand.Lumen payment but as soon as you submit.That to the network it's and you try and.Call it again and say hey I just want to.Keep collecting thousands of lumens from.This account it's going to say hey it.Hasn't been a month since the last time.We ran since we ran this contract so in.That case you don't have to have any pre.Signed transactions you simply wait.Until the time comes you generate the.Transaction and you can actually.Generate it and submit it through some.Sort of third-party service the user.Wouldn't necessarily ever have to know.Other than they would still have.Ownership over their account and if at.Any point in the future they wanted to.Cancel their subscription they would.Simply remove your turning signing.Signers from their account and any calls.To that account to make a payment would.Fail because the user removed this.Turning signing server signers from.Their account so I think if this account.Still exists we could actually look at.The signers that have been added for.This account it looks like I saw on that.One I think it's actually yeah so we've.Got the two signers here but then it's.Also got a threshold of two so while we.Need both turning signing servers to.Generate that recurring payment every.Month if at any point the user wants to.Remove those signers they're able to do.That because they have a weight of two.Set on their operation threshold so.That's been a basic overview of what I.Have so far on turning signing servers.It's still a work in progress obviously.If that's something that seems.Interesting to you and hopefully it does.I am looking for more people to get.Involved on actually building out smart.Contracts so I have quite a few turing.Signing servers just tests that turn.Signing server set up they're ready to.Be used.Ready for people to poker.And see what's possible hopefully some.Of these examples have gotten your.Wheels turning but now is kind of the.Announcement for that we need some.People to start using this thing to.Start poking it around to see if this.Makes sense as a septa see if we built.The right thing and then towards the as.That sort of happens and we sort of get.A better idea of what this should be and.How it works and doesn't work and what.Kind of contracts can be built using.This we'll move into the actual draft.The SCP draft portion where we write it.All up we have the API endpoints we.Showcase how to build one of these.Servers and run it successfully and all.The fees around it and how to generate.Revenue how to run a secure turning to a.Server but also how to create good.Contracts and then hopefully we can get.It to an active state where it starts to.Be used more and becomes a normal sort.Of used active seller ecosystem proposal.Within the ecosystem where these Streng.Signing servers become possible where.Anybody can spin up a contract and.Upload it to a plethora of turing.Signing servers and then beyond that.It's just the acceptance of it and it.Becomes a normal part of Stellar.Development alright so that was long.Apologize for that apologize that the.Demos didn't work out great hopefully.We'll have those back up and running so.That everybody can play around with what.We have so far should have that within.The next couple of days and linked on.The youtube let's go for questions I.Hope there's a couple of questions that.You guys have for me as things pop up.And I will begin to answer those and.Then we'll and then we'll close out but.As you have questions for me feel free.To type them into into the chat and.We'll walk through them otherwise you.Can find me on Twitter and key base at T.Y VD H I would love to chat all right.How is this relevant for cross-border.Payments where does this fit in.Decentralized finance well you kind of.Set it there in decentralized finance a.Lot of its going to boil down to what.You mean by decentralized everybody kind.Of has their own idea of what.Decentralized means and when it comes to.Things like D central.Payments for cross-border payments or.Decentralized finance for cross-border.Payments it's gonna come down to like.Who's in charge who's in control and.What what are the differences what.Layer's do you have when you're talking.About ownership so in the case of an.Anchor for example and wanting to.Facilitate payments being made in and.Out of the ecosystem or putting up.Offers on the order book to maintain.Liquidity between assets right now all.Of that stun and a completely.Centralized way where an entity controls.Their order books and so long as those.Orders are out there they're free to.Take them down and when you have these.Cross-border payments moving back and.Forth that can become an issue if a.Large portion of the success happens on.One entity maintaining liquidity so it.Would be possible that a liquidity.Provider could create a smart contract.That creates order books that are.Decentralized where they don't have the.Ability to alter or remove the orders.That it just runs the liquidity and.Doesn't remove itself doesn't have a.Capability to remove itself so a lot of.It has to do I think with removing.Barriers towards trust and this is.Actually kind of interesting because.That's one of the biggest barriers when.Doing cross-border payments is do I.Trust them are they going to do what I.Expect them to do by using turning.Signing servers are really by adding.Decentralization or trust minimization.Into your workflow into your business.Logic you're able to guarantee some.Level of trust because you relinquish.Some portion of control whether that's.Liquidity providing or making good on.Payments the more that you can guarantee.Through math that something is going to.Happen versus guaranteeing through.Goodwill or I have a good business plan.I've done this in the past the better.Off you're going to be when it comes to.Winning people's trust like it's going.To become true more and more as other.Businesses do that and say you don't.Trust us you verify through the code.That we've written that we don't.Ultimately control weave or link which.Control of our secret key our ability to.Alter the state of the ledger to these.Transient servers which ultimately own.The contract they run the contract.Through users interacting with it so in.That sense depending on how it's.Implemented and at what level it makes.Sense for.A company to add in trust minimization.To their business logic.Pterence and insurers will be useful for.Cross-border payments or decentralized.Finance but a lot of it again is going.To ultimately boil down to what is.Decentralization mean and is that.Actually helpful.When it comes to trust minimization or.Making payments across borders is SCF.Going to run a turn signing server who.Runs strange signing servers without any.Incentive I don't think SDF is going to.Reconcile you server I mean I run a.Couple right now just as as testing.Demos but yeah there is tons of.Incentive to run a tutoring center we.Didn't talk a whole lot about fees or.Uploading contract fees but that's a big.Part of running a churning signing.Server it would be kind of a separate.Talk - what is it like to run a turning.Sign server but you can charge excellent.Fees so basically part of the XDR when.Transcending server spits out a.Transaction part of that transaction is.Payments to the turn sending servers so.Those are these small fees paid out to.The Turing signing service as well as.Fees for actually uploading a contract.So it might be ten or a hundred lumens.Or five USD to upload a contract to a.Turing signing server so there's both.The incentive for people to upload.Contracts but also to run good.Turrentine servers so that you can.Continue to collect on fees as cheering.Sighing servers are executing smart.Contracts don't understand why you need.Signed transactions with other party.When you share your sign transactional.Attorneys sensor owner of training.Center to execute your contract only if.That Turing something let me read the.Question I really don't understand why.You need Turing signing servers to share.When you share your sign transaction.With Turing signing server owner of.Turing signing server can execute your.Contract signed transaction to attack.You again that's only if you allow that.How did you write your contract because.You some turing some contracts may.Accept a incoming XDR but it's not it.Doesn't have to be a signed transaction.That's coming in it's just instructions.Or it's just a Turing it's just a.Contract it's just a.That's been submitted to a jury in.Signing server but it doesn't have any.Signatures on it yet and if you write.Your turn signing server contract in.Such a way that the output is a.Partially signed transaction so not full.Where you still need to sign for the.Source account you still need to sign.For those fees maybe but there's still.Another signature that's needed the the.Transaction is only partially signed.It's not Val viable to submit to the.Network yet so what someone yeah a lot.Of it is gonna boil down to trusting all.Of the Turing signing servers together.But you already trust that with the way.The seller consensus protocol works.Where you trust the individual nodes.That are running Stellar so this idea of.Disinterested but incentivized third.Parties is quite strong and it has been.Proven to work quite well so ultimately.It boils down to again you get what you.Permit and if you allow for the.Generation of a transaction that is.Completely signed and valid then yes the.Turning signing server could submit that.But even that isn't necessarily an issue.Unless they're submitting something that.You don't want them to submit it.Ultimately depends on what that.Transaction does what that transaction.Accomplishes but because you're.Splitting up your secret key between.Lots of different during signing servers.Any single one probably shouldn't unless.You've allowed for it be able to do.Anything on their own they would need to.They would need to collude with other.Turing signing servers to actually.Accomplish anything dangerous so what's.The difference between sharing your.Signed transactions contracts with.Turing signing server over traditional.Servers the only difference is they.Aren't their traditional servers just.Operating as turned sending servers.Ultimately it boils down to two owns the.Turing psychic servers because if you.Own them there's not two centralization.There but if some other entity owns.Those some other entity is running those.So long as again you're uploading it to.Multiples of those you're running sort.Of a it's not a clone but it's similar.To how Stellar works already where SDF.And lobster.Coin quest all run validator nodes and.You submit a transaction to their.Network and they validate the.Transactions and perform the operations.Within those transactions this is kind.Of the same thing where you have a.Secret key which is split up amongst.Lots of different servers and those.Servers then add their signature to any.Transactions coming from the contract.And so long as it's valid and it's all.The same and it's a valid signature it.Can be submitted to the Stellar network.How would you see this use for.Subscriptions like you mentioned before.Also does this support more than just.JavaScript so I gave an example on the.Subscription model ultimately you would.Just have contracts that were built for.Different amounts or it could maybe take.Variable amounts I haven't thought too.Deeply about exactly how would we use my.Purpose isn't to be too stringent on how.It should be used and more provide a.Platform that works and then allow other.People to build on top of that so you.Kind of would have to think ok if I can.Either get ownership over someone's.Account but in a very controlled way.Through contracts only through contracts.Or I can give ownership to my account.But only through strict contracts what.Does that allow for what are the.Capabilities there and then there's.There's tons of them and subscriptions.Would be one of those with fee bumps I.Don't know I will be interesting to see.If fee bums kind of gets rid of the.Issue with recurring revenue since you.Can pay sequence numbers and fees from.Different accounts now so some of the.Issues we had there may already be gone.I haven't looked into that too deeply.But when it comes to complicated or.Turing-complete recurring revenue models.Or you need to do much more beyond just.Paying fees and sequence numbers you.Actually need to do some some logic.External logic or taking accounts of the.Person's account you know like refunds.Or oh they partially paid and now we.Have to perform some logic around some.Sort of partial payment or upgrades and.You know more strike like functionality.Then you could use something like this.To accomplish that through because.The turn signing server or smart.Contract logic and again you don't do.You need to do that.I don't know that depends on how much.Your users need and value a.Decentralized option for something like.This or a decentralized option and maybe.They do maybe they don't that ultimately.Is up to the users and what they expect.Out at the services that they're that.They're making use of all right do we.Have any other questions those were good.Questions and again this isn't this.Isn't set in stone this is this is very.Good discussion and we don't want to.Spend our time doing the wrong thing but.At the same time all you have to do is.Spend a little time looking at aetherium.To realize that smart contracts and.Turing-complete smart contracts is a.Very powerful tool that is very valuable.And I think it's worth taking a look at.Is there opportunity doesn't make sense.For us to include some sort of.Functionality like this functional.Feature parity that would allow for.Decentralized transaction creation where.You don't have to trust the person who's.Creating the transaction you can you can.Mitigate that you can relegate that.Through other parties all right.SuperDuper I appreciate everyone hanging.Out again feel free to reach out on key.Base or Twitter with follow up questions.I'll try and get working links to these.Demos as well as some API Doc's for.People to poke around if you want to get.Involved building these things or.Testing it out be sure and reach on them.You know thanks again or for coming out.And we'll catch y'all later bye.
