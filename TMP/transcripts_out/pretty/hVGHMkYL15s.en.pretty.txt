Okay I think we're live what's up.Everybody welcome to this week's edition.Of Stellar engineering talks my name is.Colton I'm the community manager here at.The cellar development foundation and I.Am NOT an engineer but I will pretend to.Be one for the next 30 minutes or so for.The sake of conversation this week I'll.Be talking about creating usable Stellar.Applications and I also wanted to give a.Reminder that this is a series that.We're planning to do on a bi-weekly.Basis so every other week we'll have an.Engineer from SCF come on and talk about.Whatever they're working on sort of.Internally at the foundation so before.We get started I want to give a little.Background on this talk and why we.Thought it might be a good idea to host.It.So lately within the ecosystem team.We've been thinking a lot about how we.Want to onboard developers into the.Ecosystem whether that's you know.Developers who aren't native to the.Blockchain space we're developers who.Are just thinking about creating.Financial applications or whatever and a.Lot of them whenever they first start.Working with Stellar they don't.Completely understand some of the.Usability implications or they don't.Understand some of the technical aspects.So creating a resource like this as a.Sort of way for them to have something.To reference and look back on to.Understand what they should be.Considering with building cellar.Applications is sort of the basis for.This talk so let's see if I can change.Slides here yes so basically also before.We get started I wanted to spend some.Time defining usable I understand that.Usable means many different things to.Many different people right we have all.These different applications within the.Stellar ecosystem they all serve.Different user bases they all have.Different use cases and so usability.Kind of means a couple of different.Things across different services so.Rather than think of this as like a set.In stone definition for what usability.Means I'm more of just trying to create.A baseline for understanding what sort.Of makes applications usable or how to.Give your application a better chance of.Being usable within this Stellar.Ecosystem so we also need to understand.Why Stellar can be hard to use.Especially for people who aren't super.Into the space right up there.Encountering your applique.For the first time what are the some of.The things that they can have trouble.With and some of these things include.Going from the real world to the.Blockchain right we all remember that.First time like how do I get my hands on.This coin or how do I use a stable coin.Also things like public and private keys.Are extremely difficult they're not.Really something you're used to in your.Daily life and there's constant there's.This concept of decentralization right.What does that even mean where is your.App on the spectrum etc there's things.Like security so for the first time a.Lot of users are responsible for their.Own security.Maintaining their own private keys.Making sure they send their funds to the.Right place etc and then you have things.That are Stellar specific like the.Seller decentralized exchange anchors.Trust lines lumens and so you can take.All this stuff and bundle it up and just.Call it hard stuff right so how do we.Create applications that abstract away.All this hard stuff and make use cases.I'm easy to understand and easy to use.For you know the average person who's.Not into the black gene space.So I mentioned all these hard things.What can we do about it.The first thing is create and use.Standards so within the Stellar.Ecosystem we have what are called.Stellar ecosystem proposals or steps and.Essentially these steps provide a set of.Standards for developers to implement.When building Stellar applications and.These are things that evolve over time.With the needs of the ecosystem these.Are things that evolve it's new use.Cases pop up and these are things that.Also evolve as technology improves so.Steps are not this thing that's like set.In stone on the protocol level disease.They're these things that are constantly.Improving for developers to use and the.Way I like to think about steps are just.This category of sort of protocols that.Exist on top of the network so.Oftentimes and we're describing Stellar.And some of its functionality a lot of.People confuse that for functionality of.The network but really it's just a.Standard that we choose to follow to.Make that functionality possible so.Think about steps is this thing that.Exists on top of the network in between.Applications and Stellar itself so it is.Possible for applications to just.Directly interact with the network.Without you know implementing any of the.Steps but the problem lies and that you.Might be able to use the network.But you might not be able to.Interoperate with other applications in.The space right like you might not be.Able to send a federated addresses you.Might not be able to work with anchors.Etc so it's really important that if.You're building an application in the.Space that you you know mind the mind.The standards try to follow the.Standards pay attention to the standards.And try to implement them whenever.You're thinking about ways to build your.Application and serve users in the best.Way possible oh I went too far so some.Examples of what you can sort of do with.SEPs or what problem steps can solve are.Things like set to the Federation.Protocol so you have a standard where.Basically we can map human readable.Addresses to Stellar addresses I know a.Lot of you probably remember the first.Time you sent any significant sum of.Money from you know whether it's your.Exchange account or your wallet and.You're typing in a public key manually.And you are super scared that you might.Have forgot you know your fur you might.Have forgot one character or one letter.Or whatever and if you mess up you lose.All your money so what better a.Federated addresses do is turn these.Public keys and to human readable.Addresses like on key base where you.Have colton star key base do or whatever.This is super easy to send to a friend.Super easy to read if you're a user and.Basically it just takes the stress away.From you know dealing with public keys.So whenever you're building applications.Thinking about okay how can I make the.Stress of public and private keys easier.To handle for my users and federated.There are the Federation protocol it's.One way to do that another way is do.Something called set 5 which is a way of.Just defining how we should derive key.Pairs and so one of the things that key.5 are set 5 lays out is this way to.Represent secret seas or private Keys as.Mnemonic phrases so mnemonic phrases are.Basically like just a list of 24 12 to.24 words I believe that basically.Represent a private key so if you're.Moving from one application to another.You don't have to copy and paste or.Write down this super long and secret.Key that you might mess up but rather.You can just write down human readable.Words and the kind of.Go behind this is just I have something.That users can resonate with right like.It's hard to write down the super long.String of characters hope you don't.Forget a number and then you're screwed.Forever so you want to come up with a.Way to make words easy to write down and.Easy to digest so that if I mess up like.Let's say I misspelled deposit and I'm.Trying to move my secret key to some.Application to another application I can.Figure out that a misspelled deposit but.I can't figure out that I forgot a.Character in my secret key that's much.Harder so the other thing to mention is.Like this is something that's constantly.Evolving right and this is like the.Benefit of doing things through SEPs.Rather than trying to change them at the.The core protocol level so there's also.A step in the works called SEP 30 which.Is basically multi-party key management.Of Stellar accounts so this is a.Protocol that basically defines a way.For an individual to regain access of a.Stellar account if they lose their.Private key so in the event that you.Lose your private key which is a huge.Usability problem not only in the seller.Ecosystem but in the blockchain.Ecosystem as a whole you can find a way.To recover that key without giving.Control of the key to a third party.Right because if controlled if a third.Party has controlled the key then that.Means they can steal your money if they.Wanted to hopefully they don't but it's.Possible so coming up with different.Ways to make you know private keys and.Public keys easier to manage for users.Is an extremely important thing to think.About when you're building your cellar.Applications then next we have standards.For anchors and clients to interoperate.With each other right this problem of.Going from the real world to Stellar or.To any other blockchain for that matter.Right now the current flow is like you.Go to a coin base or you go to buy Nance.Or whatever you create an account you.Have to buy some coin and then you send.That coin over to your wallet and then.You can maybe transfer it to a different.Coin and then send it to your friends.And then you have to go back to coin.Base and then try to get it out so.There's this like super convoluted.Process of going across different.Applications just to achieve a goal and.So we've created standards here in the.Stellar ecosystem that try to solve that.Problem such as I accept six at point.Four.SEP 26 and so basically this allows you.To go from the real world to your.Stellar wallet without ever needing to.Actually leave your Stellar wallet an.Example of this is in practice you can.See I think all mobsters soul our.Wallets teller X etc all of you support.It but an example on lobster here is.That I want to deposit USD for Maker USD.Into my account I just click deposit I.Fill out some information I click.Continue and boom anchor USDA interface.Loads up within my within my wallet I.Never have to leave and so the benefit.Of this is that you can all of a sudden.Interop interoperate with many sort of.Anchor services or on off ramp services.Inside of your application without ever.Needing to force your users to leave and.So basically we can we can make all of.Our services on Stellar interoperate.With multiple services rather than like.Having to form a partnership with just.Coinbase or form a partnership with just.Wire right you can choose a whole bunch.Of acres that you want to work with.Within your payment service outside of.Standards we can also sort of simplify.The experience we can make stuff that's.That's easy to use some of you who might.Have been in the space for a long time.Might know back in the day maybe the.Only way to sort of send or receive.Stuff like Bitcoin is through the.Command line and of course like no I.Don't think payment applications are.Going viral through the command line any.Time soon so we have to make these.Things easy to use right and so first.Steps to do stuff like that or what.Tools like Stellar laboratory right you.Create a wrapper around the entirety of.The functionality of the network and.Well to Stellar laboratory is a super.Useful tool it's a super powerful tool.It's not something that you would.Consider like for mainstream views right.It's not something that you want to give.To users and be like all right cool now.You can send payments or make trades or.Whatever so while this is a step in.Simplifying the interface it's not quite.There yet right so we have to go a step.Further and that's where things like.Crypto while it's come in so they take.The the complexity of the network and.They put it in a to easier to understand.Wrapper then.Say like something like several.Laboratory but even still crypto Wallace.Can be pretty daunting right the use.Case is not immediately obvious for.Those who don't appreciate the.Complexity of the network or completely.Understand what they're trying to get.Out of it.So by presenting all of this information.Users it can help a little bit but it.Might still be complicated for some and.So what can we do about that right like.It seems like we're out of solutions.Here but we're not we can actually.Continue to simplify until we simplify.It use cases so if you think about where.We started we simplified the interface.For interacting with the network and.Then we simplified use cases for.Interacting with the network and an.Example of this is something like.Satoshi Bay right the only aspect of.Seller you're really exposed to when.Using Satoshi pays micro payment service.Is sending transactions on the network.And then receiving transactions on the.Network.They don't expose you to a bunch of.Different interfaces they don't expose.You to a bunch of different.Functionality it's literally as simple.As deposits and lumens haze pay for some.Content nothing crazy.Additionally we see this explored.Through things like D stock where.Instead of focusing on the payments.Aspect of Stellar they focus on the.Decentralized exchange aspect of Stellar.So now you can decide ok I need to buy.And sell stocks I just need to know the.Price and I just need to say how much I.Want to buy and sell and boom I can do.It right there in the interface so I.Take away all of the complexity of.Deciding what I want to do by just.Presenting one single use case within.The app and another example of this is.Vega.So Vagos the dollar savings app that.We're working on internally here at SEF.And essentially it just lets you send.And receive different local currencies.As well as exchange in and out of those.Local currencies but you're not exposed.To a bunch of order bucks you're not.Exposed to a ton of trust science you're.Not exposed to a ton of public and.Private keys a lot of the stuff is.Abstracted away so that your overall.Experience using the application is.Super easy to understand and so again we.Want to expose users to as little as.Possible about the network hone in on.One thing that you want your application.To do really really well and just focus.On that it's not really necessary to.Support all of the functionality on.Stellar because it can be a lot to.Handle its.A lot to handle as a developer it's also.A lot to handle as a user and then the.Next thing we can do is educate users so.You want to let users know what they're.Getting up front one of the things that.I find a lot of services guilty of.Especially in this space is that people.Will understand the value proposition.Right away that's oftentimes not the.Case and so you want to make sure that.You can present that value proposition.To them some examples of this in the.Real world are say like key bases.Homepage so key base is an extremely.Powerful chat application but it's it.Can be difficult to use if you don't.Know what those value propositions are.And so you have their home page where it.Kind of goes through all of the.Functionality that's available to you.And why you might want to use that stuff.And then another example on the right is.Something like robin hood and what's.Interesting about this example is like.If you're downloading robin hood you.Probably know what you're getting before.You download it and so essentially I.Know what I was gonna get before I.Create an account but they still take.The time to educate me anyway so for.Example they do these four slides where.They talk about you know you can invest.In socks it's secured you have free.Stock trading etc they let you know what.You're getting before you even click.Signup or before you even click login.So recreating this flow within your.Stellar applications is just as.Important right not everybody.Understands Stellar's value proposition.Not everybody understands the value.Proposition of interoperability and so.Making sure that they understand those.Up front always good to do an example of.This in the Stellar ecosystem and I.Think is one of the better examples is.Lobster so before you create a lobster.Wallet they actually present you with.These four screens very similar to robin.Hood where they tell you exactly what.You're gonna get up front right trading.Platform I can manage my assets sick.That's exactly what I want to do so when.I create my account I know exactly the.Functionality that I'm looking for and I.Know exactly how I'm going to use the.App before I even get started and then.Additionally they've spent some extra.Time to translate their app into other.Currency or other languages rather.So if you're creating an application.That's global in nature which is.Absolutely possible on Stellar you want.To make sure that your service can.Actually onboard those users right you.Want to make sure that it's translated.For the target markets you're going.After you want to make sure that.Everybody can interact with your app.That you say should be able to interact.With your app unfortunately our.Community is sort of global in nature.And so it makes that process of finding.People to do these translations really.Easy right you can pay a handful of.Community members to come knock out.Translations and next thing you know you.Can serve markets all around the world.And easily onboard those users without.Any confusion so to wrap this thing up.And keep it kind of short and sweet the.Three things we went over is sort of.Following standards following and.Creating standards this is really.Important it's really important that if.You're a developer and you're creating a.Use case and there's some standard that.You think can be derived from it that.You participate in conversation and that.You do your best to try to come up with.Standards for doing things and then it's.Also important that you do your best to.Follow these standards they're there for.A reason they'll make your life easier.As not only a developer but it'll make.Your life easier as somebody trying to.Launch a product that's interoperable.With other products within the seller.Ecosystem and you can find these in the.Stellar github repo they're all there.There's about 30 ish of them or.Something like that so if you're.Building an app on Stellar make sure.You're going through those understanding.Them understanding which ones makes.Sense for your use case and all that.Good stuff.Additionally we want to simplify the.Experience like I mentioned so simplify.Interfaces right remove the stuff that's.Not necessary.Abstract away the stuff that's really.Hard and then hone in on a use case find.Out what's you know what are you.Actually trying to accomplish with your.Application is it a trading application.Is it a payments application maybe a.Little bit of both what features do you.Need to focus on what features do you.Need to present to your users and what.Features do you need to remove and then.Lastly educate users right show them.Where the value is show them what.They're getting up front and make their.Lives easier whenever they're using your.Applications you don't want to just.Dump an application with a ton of.Functionality on them that they'll never.Understand how to use and that's it so.That's pretty much all I had to touch on.Throughout this whole presentation I.Just wanted to go over some basics of.What to consider when you're getting.Started on Stellar what to consider when.You're building applications on Stellar.And how you can sort of scour the.Ecosystem to find resources that can.Make your applications usable I don't.Think there were any questions if there.Are any feel free to ask them really.Quickly and we can I can try to answer.Them but other than that if you have any.Further stuff you can't get ahold of me.On key base my username is just Colton.Additionally you can find me on medium I.Write a weekly newsletter called the dev.Digest or basically I cover all of this.Kind of stuff so if you're interested in.The latest conversations around.Ecosystem standards I cover that if.You're like if you're curious about the.Latest developments in the ecosystem I.Cover all that stuff so if you're.Interested as a developer and keeping up.With the stuff that's going on within.This our ecosystem you can easily do.That just by checking out my medium and.Then there's also some base there's.Basic stuff such as like introductions.To trust lines introductions to path.Payments all that good stuff.So if there's no questions I guess we.Can call it a little early thanks.Everybody for tuning in and remember to.Tune in I think next week we're doing a.Set browned table and then the week.After that we'll be doing another.Engineering talk so thanks everybody for.Coming by.
