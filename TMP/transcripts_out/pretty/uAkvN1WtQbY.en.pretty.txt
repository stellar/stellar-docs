All right hello everyone and welcome.Once again to the Stellar open protocol.Discussion these meetings are for.Discussing core advancement proposals or.Caps.They're technical specs that suggest.Changes to the Stellar protocol.And they allow the protocol to advance.To evolve to meet the needs of the.Ecosystem they allow us to add new.Features to the protocol these meetings.Are live streamed so that anyone who's.Interested can follow along but again.It's a technical discussion about these.Very technical caps so if you're.Watching you probably want to take a.Look at the caps that are linked to in.The show descriptions along with the.Mailing list discussions about those.Caps today we're once again discussing.The two caps we discussed last time cap.42 multi-part transaction sets which.Again has been revised since our last.Discussion and CAP 44 speed x.Configuration there have been a lot of.Questions on the mailing list about that. so this meeting again is just part of.The caf CAP life cycle and a lot of.Open discussion about the caps actually.Happens on that mailing list again link.To in the show description so if.You're really interested in joining the.Discussion.Please sign up for that mailing list and.You can sort of see a lot of these.Questions come in and a lot of the.Answers are made there or they're sort.Of brought the questions are brought to.This meeting .And so.I'm going to sort of end it there if you.Want to look up anyone who is in this.Meeting and find out who we are you can.See our names i'll let you do that on.Your own.But in the interest of just keeping.Things moving along let's.Actually just kick off the conversation.So first up we're going to talk about.Cap 42 multi-part transaction sets .This CAP would give validators control.Over which fee policy to use for.Individual transactions.Including.Included in a ledger and we actually.Discussed it previous meeting it was.Revised it was revised again.And so I'm going to kick it over to.Nikola who made some of those revisions.So that he can walk us through the.Changes real quick nico.Yeah thanks justin so.Yeah like the actually there was the.Changes I made were actually pretty.Minor .I mean expected given where we are .So.Yeah like the the changes were basically.Reflecting the .What we discussed at the last protocol.Meeting so.The the actual functional change in the.Cap is the..The use of the total. on the sum of fibs as to to to.Sort .Transaction sets. and then the other change is .Related to questions that .That we had last time and that were.Also raised on the on the mailing list.Around.What does it mean for clients in.Particular we have documentation today.That talks about using.Like like the fee stats or the . like bidding as much as you can.As a strategy and this needed to.Be tweaked a little bit so i.I put a.Possible approach to how to to do.This with the after this new captex.Takes effect.So like.I don't know if people have time to.Review it I think I imagine actually.That maybe lee that I think was.Not at the last protocol meeting maybe.Has some questions.Yeah I did listen to the last protocol.Meeting and I think the.Conversation actually answered a lot of.The questions that I had and I think you.And it goes on the mailing list. I think the only comment that I had.About the conversation where you know.The.Wallets will probably change.The pattern that they use to.Use things like fee bumps you know if.They need to bump the up.The the fee they're paying I think.Realistically for your average wallet .You know fee bumps will probably not.Even be necessary it'll be more like.You know you try to submit a transaction.It fails and so you just modify the fee.On your current transaction so you've.Got a new transaction.And then you sign that again and submit.It. the pattern sounds pretty clear .And.I think..The the only remaining question I have.Is do we need to discuss.What the rollout will look like because.Given that.Given that wallets will you know there.Is some change in expectations.You know what sort of lead time do we.Basically need to give the ecosystem.To.To adjust or learn about this new.Process.Right so like time I mean .Yeah like as.As long as people like you said like.Today I imagine that most wallets.Actually deal with.Like failures like timeouts of when.They submit transactions. but I do agree that there is like.Some.Awareness here on this is about to.Change you may actually run into. well you probably.Want to maybe reduce the.The maximum bid for for wallets that are.Where people actually set very high bids.Which I think there are some I mean not.Very high but like.You know.Like let's say one lumen which is very.High for in today's standard.So yeah so there's probably some.Communication that needs to go out there.Too that people should actually not.Put like some.Very high number that they don't expect.To to pay and instead .I think maybe aligned with what actually.A lot of wallets are it seems to be.Doing a lot of what the common fee we.See which is more in the 10 000.Troops or something.Or 40 000 troops which is still.Some penny yeah I think I think a lot go.With a hundred thousand.Which is I mean this is still fine yeah.I mean there are still even with this.New thing unless people are doing .I think the the first wave of changes .Will probably be around.But we discussed earlier in the morning.Is that was.Make it a bit more aggressive for .Like this those trading this kind of.Trading activity there is more.Competition there.So if people are.Submitting. at yeah like 100 000 troops they may.Actually end up paying that with the.With this update.For trading yeah.So yeah I don't know like I think it's.More like yeah like a communication.Strategy and documentation I think that.We need to work on just in terms of.Communication strategy and documentation.Are we imagining that it is possible.That this CAP could be included in.Protocol 19 or is this already something.That might be for a subsequent protocol.Oh yeah protocol 19 I mean like.Ideally I think we.We can put it in protocol knighting.Which will..I think at the current pace. it looks like maybe it will be like.In the.At the earliest end of may which is.Quite a bit of time for people to adjust.Their wallets.Or their settings in their wallets.Yeah I also think the.The lead time on using the feature.Doesn't have to be the same as the lead.Time on implementing the feature.If this went into protocol 19 but.We do some surveying and.It looks like you know that's not a.Realistic time.Frame for wallets like maybe we could.Maybe the ecosystem will hold off using.The feature for some period of time.Right because validators would have to.Decide to use the feature and so.There could be some readiness check.Where before any validator use of the.Feature happens there's just like a sort.Of coordination.Okay.Yeah like very like yeah exactly like.Those things will be enabled by flags.On the validator so .Yeah there will be a an actual role i.Mean it means I mean it still means that.If .Like.After this change takes effect you.If you have like one of the validators.That decides they want to ignore the.Flags or enable the features anyways.They can.But that's part of the.Like the .Audi trail that we have in the .In the .In the archives on the on on behavior of.Your validity.Are there any questions about where we.Are with CAP 42 but it sounds like we're.In a pretty good spot.I think we left it at a good spot last.Time and this addressed the things that.Came up so.Seems.Pretty much ready to me.I mean I have one nit but it actually.Doesn't come up in this .In this cap. which is the way we indent our case.Statements.Is not compatible with git diff so.As a general point maybe we should.Either like.Include both the diff and the actual.Data structures or we should like.Reconsider how we indent xdr files it.Just so happens that we lucked out and.Then this diff like there's enough.Context to read it properly but.Sure I think that that's a formatting.Issue right which we can sort of talk.About offline cool.I mean it sounds like with this cap.It is probably ready to bring to a vote.Which I can do off which I can.I guess we can maybe do at the beginning.Of the next meeting.Since jed happens to not be here today.In which case I think we can move on and.Talk about we could vote asynchronously.I don't think we need to wait for the.Next meet I mean I'm ready to vote and.To move this forward so okay cool i'll.I'll schedule a vote asynchronously. and then we can share the results.Publicly .And that way we don't have to wait and.We can sort of push that forward.Cool so I think then in other words cat.42 is ready to put to the CAP committee.For vote which is super cool possibly.For inclusion protocol 19..But now it is time to move on to the.Next discussion point CAP 44 so cap.44 again is the speed x configuration.Cap .Speed x is a. new design for essentially a fully on.Chain dex decentralized exchange .That allows for scaling high trend to.High transaction throughput.And we talked about speed x a fair.Amount this year it's part of the s more.Importantly get rid of path payments so.You no longer have to guess intermediary. currencies to get the best price.Cool.Yes and .But but for speed x we actually decided.To break up the implementation of speed.X into several caps and this first one.Cap 44 is about how speed x is about who.And how speed x can be configured and.There's been some pretty interesting.Discussion on the mailing list but to.Sort of kick off I'm going to pass it to.John.Sure thanks justin.Just to give like a quick overview of.Like what the discussion on the mailing.List has kind of been about the.Conversations have kind of gone in like.A couple different directions.One question is about .Can we.Practically derive the.The set of assets that we can use with.Speedx.Rather than trying to configure it.I think the answer to that at this point.Is probably no.But we can talk about it more.Then another line of conversation has.Been around the basically the.Lane of like.Okay let's say that we do the simplest.Thing and just you know do a do what's.In the CAP now just like a voting.Upgrade system.Can we can we give some guidelines to.The validators that are actionable and.Predictable so that we don't have.Arguments in the community about like.What should be included.And then a third line of conversation.Has kind of been about like the more.General.More general process types of things.Like should we change the way that we do.Upgrades to make this easier.And increase visibility and stuff like.That but none of this has resulted in.Any changes to the actual proposal yet.Because it's not remotely clear which.Direction we should go.So with that kind of overview of.Where the conversation has gone maybe we.Should just like open up the floor and.See what people want to talk about. my my two cents around the the actual.Ecosystem stuff around how to how to.Make decisions I don't think this.Belongs in the CAP i.As a starting point I think we could.Just discuss you know validators can.Discuss over.The values channel on key base of the.Validators channel on on the discord .There's no need to put too much.Structure around this. same way that we coordinate .Protocol upgrades these days obviously.This is much more. you know there will be some some.Arguments and it's good but I don't.Think we need to.Like let's see.What this looks like before we start.Solving for a problem that we don't.Actually know.What it's going to look like.I mean I think the fact that we have.This debate in these questions.Suggests to me that this isn't quite the.Right design.So I still think that there's.Multiple stakeholders here yes.Validators are stakeholders but so are.The asset issuers and I don't think that.I think that we should give more weight.To the asset issuers than the.Validators and to the extent that.Validators should be important it's only.Because they're designated as kind of.Official.Repositories of information by the asset.Issuers.I agree with david but I don't agree.With with the result I think that .Asset issuers should strive to be.Validators I think that's like proper.Scp usage.And then they will have a vote.But you know just by virtue of having.Like an asset issued.I don't think that's enough to.Inform the validator network what to do.But I think as an asset issuer you are.You are choosing to I issue your asset.On Stellar because you know in large.Part because you want a liquid market.Between your asset and and other assets.Right and so.You have an opinion about which which.Markets are important for your asset.And .And and that's just not.Reflected by by having the validators . make this decision so what are the.Mechanics that you suggest for allowing.Acid issuers to do this david. well I think that instead of a.Protocol upgrade this could be .A new type of operation. or a new type of of ledger entry.Which is the .The other assets that like you're.Interested in being in a speed x with.Once you know when there's like a.Kind of mutually .Satisfactory speed x's then. like you could potentially .Then you could like sort of create the.Speed x but it should come it should we.Should somehow have a way for the assad.Issuers to express which or rank sort of.Which assets they're most interested in.In being in a speed x with.And but and we shouldn't necessarily.Have only one speed x right because. you know maybe there's.You know multiple disjoint sets of.Assets and you know who are the.Validators to say like which one is is.Reality right like.And and how are the asset issuers.Expected to.You know like this operation what is it.I think one of the options that we were.Talking about was like staking lumens.Right are there are there.Other options or are we just like.Reverting back to kind of like.Stake weighted voting mechanisms the.Same no it could just be like.It could just be .A .Like a.A ledger like .You know an account entry or whatever.That you say like which which assets you.Want to be like you have trust lines you.Could have sort of like .You know speedx participations where you.Like specify almost like a quorum slice.Of of .Of assets that you want to have in your.But every asset's gonna .Issue or like lots of assets are gonna.Issue these and there's .You know the the protocol still needs.Some way of deciding like which .Which assets are sort of important and.Then maybe there's like some kind of i.Don't know max weight matching.Computation or something going on but .We still probably have to restrict it.Down to like a certain size or a.Certain. like network objective right so.There should be a configuration.Parameter which is kind of like maximum.Size of a speed x.Right.But to me that seems like the only thing.The validators should really be deciding.And then it should be the assets.Themselves that .That choose to make a market.What what are you wait am I unmuted yeah.I am what about the what about the.Case of contention like.Take the most liquid assets on.Stellar which like buy.By like amm liquidity we could say. would be like .I don't know I think it's like ustc xln.Aqua a couple other assets.What .Most assets would want to be able to.Trade with those because that's where.You get a lot of benefit from speed x.Being able to swap with the liquid ones.So let's just say that like for the sake.Of argument to say that ustc has like.The most liquid markets on seller i.Don't know if that's true but let's.Pretend for the sake of argument. and then basically there's like.Global contention on wanting to be in.The same speedx as usdc.Who do we choose.Well that gives usdc a lot of cloud.I think usdc should be then should be.Able to decide.You know who gets to be in a speed x.With them.Or.Maybe usdc can be in multiple speed x's.I mean that that creates arbitrage.Opportunity but.Maybe it's not ridiculous.Maybe we think that the price of uscc is.So stable that if it's in multiple speed.X's who cares it's the thing that will.Anchor the valuations of all the other.Assets.I think we're putting a bit too much.Responsibility and weight on the asset.Issuers in this case like if you look.At prior art and other networks.You know like that the issuer just.Issues their asset and then there's like.A governing body for whatever.Decentralized exchange yeah I understand.And so I would be into like reducing.Responsibility but not reducing sort of.Like the privilege of like a powerful.Asset issuer right because when it comes.Down to it. you know.You know if usdc still like the problem.Is we might have you it might be the.Uscc issues their asset and they just.Don't care they don't want to think.About speed x if other people have a use.For it that's great and so it'd be great.If kind of the default word that you.Could be like recruited into whatever.Speed x but that .If it comes down to it like you actually.Have a say in like which markets are are.More important for your asset.I mean maybe the problem is I don't have.A concrete proposal so maybe what I need.To do in the next week or something is.Like come up with like a concrete.Counter proposal for like what this.Would look like or maybe we could kind.Of a few of us could meet offline and.Like brainstorm about this.You know at the very least I would like.To convince myself maybe what I'm asking.For is impossible right but at the very.Least i'd like to convince myself that.It's impossible. well and the other thing like and.I think that's why where I started when.I when I discussed this on the main list.I was wondering like.Why does.Like if you want to have issuers for.Example. have some say in the composition of.Speedex.That should be part of how.That SEP is written right for how.That.That set is is managed by the validator.I mean it's governance so you know it's.One component I don't know if it's.If it needs to be.Kind of baked into the protocol in any.Way really.Well one thing I need to baked in is.Whether there's one speed x or sort of.One or more speed x's and.I I'm very much of the feeling that .You know the the.The whole kind of Stellar philosophy is.Like you know.We're not here to tell anyone what the.Ground truth is we'll just let you know.Like you can have some weird quorum.Slice that you're some weird quorum.That's an entire entirely civil attack.And then you can have the real world and.Like if they diverge like no big deal.I would similarly.Like to be able to have like if there's.Assets that are happy being in a speed x.Together and they're disjoint then i.Don't want to be in a position to decide.Which are the real assets and which of.The fake out like validators shouldn't.Be doing that.I guess at the same time oh sorry go.Ahead no go ahead jeff the validators.Are the one expending the compute to .To run it right so they should have a.Say at least I think well there's.Fees being collected and I mean you know. yeah but the there's like a non-zero.Cost of just like running and.Maintaining speed x that's more than.Just like you have the assets in your.Database.I mean well now there's a question of.Like should we be compensating.Validators or is like is it cheap enough.To run a validator that's not a big deal.Well I'm just worried about like.Somebody spinning up like a thousand.Instances or there should be some.Kind of we have to process it.Appropriately right I mean sure . I guess it's I just I prefer I prefer.To use like market-based solutions like.We think that this like consumes.Resources on the network therefore.People should be paying for it. I prefer a marketplace solution to a.Like validators know best type solution.Which is kind of what we're doing here.Let me let me offer you maybe such a.Like it's not quite what you want i.Think but it it fits kind of nicely into.That space it's something that i.Mentioned it both to jeff and nico.Offline. so like the CAP currently written is.Basically like validators control the.Speed x asset set and there was a whole.Line of questioning like could we drive.The speed x assets which I kind of was.Like I have no idea how to do this i.Don't know if it's actually even.Remotely possible even feasible. and I presented some examples that.Are like kind of challenging.But when I was looking at that example.One of the things I realized is like.There's probably a core set of assets.That you'd kind of want in your speedx.No matter what like you know the world's.Most liquid assets you know I think the.Example I gave for like.The imf.What's their thing called .The reserve basket thing I can't think.Of the word off the top of my head right.Now. it's kind of like a good.Representation of that or in america.It's like t-bonds and you know s p 500.Or whatever.You know you'd always want those just.Have the liquidity from them.But there's a whole bunch of stuff.You might want to trade that's not those.Assets and so a hybrid solution is okay.Like dr's.Yeah sdrs thank you that's the word i.Could not think of I appreciate it .And so .One like world you could imagine is a.World where like you know you have let's.Say we have space for 100 speed x assets.That's like the com the compute power we.Have.So then we say like okay like the.Validators can configure 50.And they can configure it however they.Like using some off-chain governance.Protocol whatever cares.The other 50 are literally what's in the.Transaction set.Determined by fees just like any other.Way you get into the transaction set.So in that case the transaction set can.Still have 100 total speed x assets 50.Are fixed and advanced by the validators.The other 50 are just like literally the.Ones that appear in that transaction set.If there's if there's 51 in the.Transaction set it's invalid. and that basically means like the.Validators don't have like.The truth power they just have the power.To say like hey like we think these are.The things that everybody always wants.So we can try to give you consistently.Good prices but why don't we I mean why.Why.Speculate that these are the things.People always want why not .Have people actually say what they want.Right so I mean so here's a like a dumb.Thing we could do okay let's say there's.Only one speed x but we could have is we.Could have everybody like vote their.Lumens for like which assets they most.Want to see in the speed x right and.Then you know we just take this set.Of assets that that has the.The greatest vote.Why are we reverted reverting to stake.Weighted voting this is like.Like because it's less.Stellar philosophy.No.Why is it a anti-Stellar philosophy.Because because like we shy away from.The idea of.Of of you know more money equals more.Votes.Well I mean what we're trying to what.We're trying to capture with scp is like.Some abstract notion of cloud right.And you know we want this idea of like.If people are interested in a particular.In a.You know particular asset then and that.Asset you know say like designates a.Validator then like that validator is.Going to have more clout in the network.I mean I agree like this stigmatic.Voting isn't perfect but it's at least a.Market-based solution the problem is.Like you can't have a market-based.Solution to consensus if you don't.Already have consensus or you can't but.I mean there's our proof-of-stake.Systems but they have all these other.Drawbacks right which we which we don't.Have but once we have consensus .Then i'd rather have.Market-based solution just because we do.Trust the validators to.Maintain consensus doesn't mean we.Should give them lots of extra power too.If we don't have to.I think going back to my original.Appointment I think this is a great.Opportunity to get stakeholders to.Actually run their own validators which.Is what you know like we've been talking.About sap forever as actual stakeholders.Running validators this gives them a.Reason to do that.I guess that's true but that it seems a.Little.Indirect .I mean I actually agree with.Tomorrow's point here like if you're if.You're issuing like an asset that's.Going to be used by everyone then.Like you certainly at least should.Like have a strong incentive to run a.Validator or if you're not you're sort.Of free loading off of everyone else.Running validators well I mean in an.Ideal world you wouldn't necessarily.Need to run a validator but you would.Need to like hire someone to run a.Validator so I think like a reasonable.Like state of the world in like the.Three years is that there are various.Companies like block demon or whatever.Who run like sort of validator in a.Sorry .Anchor in a box type products where.You you know what you could do is you.Could you don't have to run a value.But you pay them to run the validator.For you and they can provide insurance.Or like you sort of whatever else. and it's there's no reason why.Someone just just is like probably a lot.Of people like running their validators.On amazon right and so we don't need.Like everybody to run a physical server.We just need everyone to say hey like we.Trust amazon to like host our validator.And like and and and that's fine but.It's but they're at least explicitly.Saying like yes this is the validator.That you should trust sure sure but but.There's that contractual relationship.There and through that I can tell .Whoever is running my validator to vote.For my asset to be in speed x in.Whatever way right .And you know I'm still funding them.To run the validator but the problem is.That now let's say let's say that you.Know.In in three years you know 40 of all.The kind of assets that anybody cares.About have like contracted with block.Demon to be their validator right now we.Still haven't.You know so now like.We haven't told block demon like how to.Wait like various votes or whatever so.It's now is now black demon gonna be.Actually the one.Deciding which assets are important this.Is going to be some term of like you.Negotiation and these like confidential.Contracts they potentially have with.Their more important customers or can we.Do it in an open transparent like you.Know reasonable non-discriminatory .Way where it's just like public how this.Is happening and the decision is is.Is out in the open.You guys mind if we zoom in on a.Different aspect of what david was.Talking about a second ago for a few.Minutes can we zoom in on the one speed.X versus multiple speed x.Question.I think like we have not given a lot of.Thought to this this did not come up on.The like on the.Cellar dev mailing list also I just want.To make sure we talk about it at least a.Little bit I think it loops back into.The other question as well.I can imagine.I think that if we come up it's possible.If we come up with an answer to the.Thing we're just talking about that it.Would work more easily if there's a.Single speed x.But otherwise then you know all sql we.Should have multiple speed x's.I would.Yeah my vote is is like I don't find the.Idea.Offensive I'm just not sure that we need.To be thinking about this right now i.Think that if we do get to a point where.It looks like the list of relevant.Assets is growing to a point where.This is like it's too much for a single.Speed x.Then we can start you know.Contemplating the idea of adding another.One but it seems like getting started.With with more than one speed x given. the shape of of the markets on.Stellar I think it's it's getting ahead.Of ourselves I think that we should.Absolutely.Think it's like we literally have like.You know an xdr diff in front of us.Which is actually what we're. debating at the end of the day and so.There's absolutely a question of like.Should there be an array of maximum.Length one such that down the line we.Can like you know increase the array.Size. or.Should it be sort of hard-coded like.This to have like only a single.But again I think it's like preliminary.To make that decision right now until we.Figured out how we're going to choose.What the assets are but I think like an.Important kind of safety valve of.Of like ensuring that like we're.Choosing assets in a in a.Kind of.Stellar and and like egalitarian way.And and market-based way is to say that.Hey like you know if if there's like.Complete disagreement in the world then.Fine like have two speed x's like let's.Not decide which one is the civil attack.And which one are the real assets.Let's go back to the other thing for one.Second then since there's.People don't seem to want to talk about.This.But let me offer you a.Thing a version of the world where.Issuers actually.Have some control. it's like a.Kind of slightly weird version of the.World but it's not one that we've spoken.About yet.So in this version of configuration the.Validators don't vote on any asset.Configuration doesn't apply at all.Every issuer.Can like produce a list of assets that.They'd like to be in speed x with them.My guess is that most of those lists.Will be exactly the same.Or we could even have the validators.Configure the default list and you only.Get a different list if you actually put.Something in that way if you're happy.With the default you don't have to do.Anything.My guess is still that they would all be.Very much the same but it's possible.They wouldn't.And then the way that we get the actual.Set of assets in speedx is we.Take every asset that appears in the.You bid for fees to get a transaction.Step so that's very market-based.And then the way we fill out the rest of.The asset set is we go over every asset.Issuer.For for each of the assets that.Appears in the transaction set and we.Grab the asks from their list.Now like the reason you have to do that.Second part is like you definitely don't.Want to so there's a different speed x.For every block.Every block would have a different set.Of assets potentially but actually i.Almost prefer this we can even say like.You're just not allowed to when you're.Forming a block it's like ill-formed if.Your speed x involves.More than whatever the parameter number.Of assets is right so any given block.Can only have a certain number of .Of.Assets being touched by the speedx.Operations and that could change from.Block to block.But.Hold on just I want to make before you.Go jeff I just want to make sure that.I'm on the same page as you david do you.Want the pure anarchy approach.Where the validator like the validator.Nominating the transaction set chooses.All the assets in the set or do you want.The semi-anarchy approach where they.Choose the asset like they choose the.Off the operations.And then you go to the issuers to get to.Fill out the set.No I think I think actually the idea.That like .Each each you know you have one speed x.Per block and it just there's some.Maximum number of assets that can be can.Be mentioned in a given block for the.Speedx transactions.Like i.I think that this well so so one.Point like why are we talking about.Filling out the asset set my instinct.Is that .In almost every situation we're going.To be having to prune down to a.Certain size not like fill out assets .And then point two I think is there's.A huge value in having predictability in.What the assets that's going to be .Otherwise .Like I like.Otherwise that like maybe you know some.Validator says like I'm going to have.This at some other validator says I'm.Going to have that asset and I'm like.Now I started playing games about like.Where I send my transactions and then.Like transactions get you know buffered.And then things get front run and then. starts getting really messy we'll.Have a deterministic set of rules like.It'll be whoever like whatever collects.The most transaction fees or something. but I can still gain that with the.Deterministic I like I had a hard time.Coming up with like a deterministic rule.That wasn't gainable because I can.Always submit .Like transactions that are out of the.Money or whatever to get my. assets in.Maybe maybe I'm just being paranoid i.See so you're saying like you can you.Can create standing orders.Right I can set an order with like a.Minimum price of like a million or.Something and that'll never trade.And manipulate this manipulate the asset.Selection rules which then manipulates.The prices.I mean i'd like to brainstorm about this.Maybe offline a little bit because.Like if there's if there's transactions.That you know are not going to like i.Wonder if you can have a you know how.Like you can have a post limit order.Only type.Order.So like maybe those could be free.And then like maybe we could have people.Post however and cancel limit orders.Like for as many assets as we want and.Then we actually choose speed x based on.Like the I don't know the depth of the.Order book or the .Number of transactions or something. because in a way you really want.For the trend for to to like you you.Want the ones with the highest number of.Transactions because that's where you.Need the extra efficiency.I I don't know if that's true at all i.Mean like you should just revert back to.The mailing list where I gave like a.Whole bunch of examples every time.Anybody mentioned like a derivable set.About how you could game them and I i.Feel.I feel so confident that they're all.Gameable that I i'd be willing to wager.That for any.Heuristic that you came up with I could.Find a way to gain it. I feel pretty confident.Not that much but I still feel pretty.Confident.So I don't know david's come up with.Some pretty crazy stuff before I feel.Like he could maybe come up with.Something that I couldn't figure out how.To how to game even though I still.Believe it would be game.So that's why I'm not willing to really.Make a big league but my point.Is like any kind of heuristic is.Probably extremely vulnerable.And like the burden of proof to get me.To want to vote for something like that.To want to support something like that.And to want to implement something like.That would be convincing me that it's.Not gameable.And I think that's going to be really.Really hard.Just like just being honest I think.Driving the transaction set.Is just borderline.So but but if there's multiple speed x's.It could make the gaming not a problem.Right if the way I game the system is by.Creating a second speed x who cares.But we still like to determine the.Competition.Yeah it's not like you're creating an.Infinite number of speed x's either so.At some point you have to pick which one.Of those feed x's is well it's not like.You have an infinite number of of.Transactions in a block either so.No but that's it goes back to it it's.All gameable.I think there's just generally value.Value in having a.System that sort of runs predictably.Here. I agree I agree but.All right I feel like that I feel well.Look this thing obviously is not ready.To to move oh well to be accepted today.Anyway right so I feel like now and i.Feel like now I have a challenge to like.At least propose something. or try or figure out why I can't you.I think we should also think about or.Sorry go ahead I did want to answer one.Question that you had actually before.Jeff which is like why are you talking.About filling out the transaction set.And it goes back to that like that.Example I posted like it's like five or.Six or seven or eight emails back now on.The mailing list.Like it was like an example using like.Major world currencies and like it was a.Trade for like pounds for yen. but basically like the concern I have.Is like you end up in a in a world where.Imagine that like you know.Imagine that the russian central bank.Just like happened to announce for some.Crazy reason that they were going to.Raise their interest rate from 9.5 to 20. not that this is realistic at all but.Like imagine that would happen.I imagine that there might be a ton of.People who wanted to sell their rubles.Maybe all for euros and usd.But like if you only have those three.Assets you're potentially missing out of.A lot of like cross liquidity that you.Can get from area to bro markets like.You know where you use the other amms to.Pull more.Source and sync through so that you can.Trade more rubles at a good price.So now imagine that for some.Crazy reason usdc doesn't want there to.Be a very liquid market between rubles.And usdc. and so they feel like if they're.Going to be in a speed x they would.Prefer to be at a speed x without e.Rubles or whatever.That is a good point I think at least.The asset issuer should have a veto on.On participation.Well either they should have veto or if.They should.They should at least not be in any way.Complicit like it should be like it.Should be like everybody else wanted it.And they were overruled or something. yeah I guess yeah and also. we've been we've been expressing like.Asset issuers want good markets with.Certain assets and we should also let.Them express the opposite opinion i.Don't want to market with this asset. you know listen six years here's.Something here's something we could do.We could actually have.Speed x's owned by account so we could.Say like look we're actually going to.You know instead of a validator there's.Just like someone everybody thinks is.Important and we're going to let them.Choose the assets and they're going to.Create a speed x and if you don't like.That then you can create your own speed.X and if people start trading on your.Speed x great if not then you're.Irrelevant. this makes it harder with the.Liquidity pools and also isn't this like.More unaccountable.Than the validator well it's it's both.More and less like we know who it is.Right there's now like someone who's.Running the speed x and if that person.Needs to comply with like russian.Sanctions that person can remove the.Ruble and if somebody else you know if. if if somebody in russia says hey you.Guys suck I'm going to create a new.Speed x on Stellar.You know more power to them they can do.That but if none of the other assets.Want to move over to the new speed x.Then then that new speed x with the.Ruble it'll be the ruble trading against.Nothing right.What if we did something with like asset.Issuers issue preferences and then.Validators issue like weights to.Different assets and then we compute .Via some like global optimization like.Min I don't know max matching or.Something.Based on the express preferences or.Sounds complicated at some point you're.Really starting to ask a lot of people.To do a lot of complications okay so.Well so what I'm saying is simple what's.Wrong with my thing like there's just a.There's just each speed x has a dictator.But there's multiple speed x's so at the.End of the day if the dictator is bad.People will just go to a different speed.X.And is there in your world an unlimited.Number of speed x's that can be created.Because.That's our question how do you stop an.Evil dick or just like some someone who.Should not be creating a bunch of speed.X's from creating a bunch of speed-ups.Maybe they were there you need some like.Reserve currency or you need some.Reserve balance to do it or something or.Like well.What we have I think we're probably fine.Having like five speed x's right you.Probably don't want like.Five million but .This has the nice benefit of giving a.Particular person accountability for.Like running the price computation .But it also. we need to figure out how to bring.The liquidity pools like what if.There's a you know competition between.For like liquidity pool liquidity.I think we could just have arbitrage.Opportunities I mean like we hope no but.But like you can't run this price.Competition with like if usdc and euros.Are .Both in two different speed x's then.There's like contention on the liquidity.Pull between the two assets. and and.Maybe there's only maybe the only asset.That can be more than one liquidity pool.Is the lumen because no one's there to.Like control the lumen but otherwise the.Asset issuer has to has to say which.Liquidity pool they want to be in.Right so then we're saying like asset.Issuers declare exactly which fedex.They're in.Yeah. which is back to the first point that.You decided you didn't like.Or somebody decided they didn't like it.There's one additional point that I want.To bring into the picture here which is.You know our acid issuers.They're active on on several networks.And a lot of a lot of the activity in.The in the space is kind of like.Multi-chain.I think we really need to focus on our.Differentiators being like high value.Differentiators because every time we.Add something to Stellar that makes it.So much more different than any other.Network network index out there.We we.Just make it more challenging for these.For these players to actually be.Idiomatic players in a Stellar ecosystem.So we really need to make sure that.Whenever we add something that's.Different it's really worth it.Okay and having asset issuers need to to.Be involved in listing on decentralized.Exchanges.Is a big step away from what they're.Used to be used to doing right now so i.Just want to be cognizant about that so.Yeah I think your your point is right.But it's not inc so I think what we want.To do is we want asset we want to give.Asset assures the control but we want to.Ensure that something good happens to an.Asset issuer who just doesn't care and.Hasn't configured it yet right like.Maybe usdc like they can't be bothered.To learn about speedx but everybody else.Is interested in that asset and so we.Need to make sure that that makes it.Onto like a good speed x. you know like going like a different.Direction in this conversation do people.Actually care.Like right now.There's no way to really stop your asset.From trading against another asset like.It can happen on the decks for like.Basically.Any asset like as long as you as long as.Somebody is authorized to hold your.Asset like.I mean they can trade it for anything.They want.So like why should we.Give that additional power in speed x.Like I know that there's some like.Interesting because of scalability right.Only if yes if we could have a million.Assets in a single speed x I would.Say we shouldn't do any of this right so.It's only I think for the scalability.Problem.I guess my point is like.There are two kinds of preferences we.Were talking about one is the positive.Preference like i'd like to have this.Liquidity available to me.That's that's pretty easy like my.Proposal.Or rather not to me but to my to like.People who want to trade my ass i'd like.To have this liquidity available.The reverse position.Which is like i'd like to not have this.Liquidity available is not not something.Expressible really on Stellar today i.Don't know why we should make that.Accessible so basically what you're.Saying is like you shouldn't you.Shouldn't.You shouldn't let an asset issuer .Prevent their asset from being traded.With ruble anyway if they really care.What they should do is they should like.You know use reclaimable assets they.Should sanction you know they should kyc.Their users and they should like to go.To the appropriate authorities if they.Have evidence that someone is like.Evading sanctions and you know they've.Kyc people so exactly so okay I think.That's fine because that's. and and if they really care they can.Use clawback or they can you know revoke.The trust line to freeze it exactly they.Can basically say okay like you're doing.Stuff that we don't approve of like it's.Not in our terms of service.That's true and in fact so really what.We should be thinking of is the only.Reason we're talking about any of this.Is because we can't put every asset in.The speed x it's just for scalability.Just real quick quick question about.That that is a functional limit that we.Can't change is that correct or is there.A chance that we could.Through some sort of.Engine ingenuity or engineering research.Breakthrough absolutely but but but but.They're like the limit is.Just remind me like what is the reason.For the limit.That's a great question and jeff is the.Best place to answer it right so.There's two things right so there's .The price computation itself and then.The sort of follow-up.Correction.Linear programming . basically the the .The runtime of each loop of the price.Computation is.Linear in the number of asset pairs. and also you might need more rounds.Based on more assets.This is especially like you need more.Rounds of the price computation.Typically for assets that are more.Thinly traded .And then so so there's that scalability.Problem and then there's also.The the follow-up sort of linear.Programming step . if I just threw a standard linear.Programming solver at it I would sort of.That that seems to top out at like 50 to.100 assets and then I was running.Experiments last night which you know.Caveat that code that you run right late.At night is usually broken but I was.Pulling in some.Other open source libraries that i.Hadn't played with before and that.Seemed to push it to like a few hundred.Like three or four hundred assets. but but after that you know you're.Solving a .Some variant of a linear program which.Has.Typically a quadratic or cubic or.Something some kind of run time which.Which sort of no matter what you're.Eventually going to have a prohibitive.Bottleneck there.There's some things you can play with it.And and possibly you know breakthroughs.You can make but.We're doing some more research on that.Topic it's something that like me and.Jeff and a couple other people around.Sdf were talking about quite extensively.Yesterday. and it looks like you know it's.Pretty clear we can do better than.Jeff's original estimate of 100 but like.Getting significantly better than a.Thousand also probably looks kind of out.Of reach right now.Like even if we can do better than you.Know what jeff hacked up in the middle.Of the night yesterday i.I wouldn't be confident to say we could.Do a thousand that already sounds really.High maybe we'll find out we're wrong.But like 10 000 or you know 50 those are.Numbers that like are not even really in.The conversation like they don't even.Sound remotely plausible within like the.Limits we're working right now like to.Achieve those kinds of numbers which.Would still be a fraction of the total.Number of assets on Stellar. we would be like we'd be as david.Said like doing novel.Perhaps unprecedented research.So so here's an idea what if each what.If each speed x had its own order book.Sorry what do you mean.In other words so so the problem so one.Of the problems with having the with the.Sort of the dictator one dictator per.Speed x model that I think john brought.Up is that you could have . you could have two dictators each of.Whom wants to include both usdc and and.Eurt right and so now what if like.You so now they're sort of competing for.The same set of orders but they the.Pearson the person placing the order.Could also name the.The speed x.Or we could somehow divvy up the or the.Order book between speed x's.I mean this seems fine to me I think.Anytime you have multiple speed x's with.The same assets you're going to fragment.Liquidity but.Or actually what if you just run them in.Different phases I mean like.You know if we if we only have like five.Speed x's right if we run the speed x's. serially then we just have some.Random order you do the first speed x.And then you just use whatever's left.Over the order book to do the second.Speed x and then the third speed x.My real concern is just like.I I just really feel like the returns of.Doing this are just like really marginal.My intuition and.My intuition's been wrong many times.Before so I'm not claiming that what i.Believe is necessarily right but like my.Guess is all the really high quality.Liquid assets appear in the first speed. whatever you want to label this first.Spur speed x and some ordering you know.I'm not saying that the first px might.Be the one that executes second right i.Understand I understand but what I mean.Is like basically the first speed x is.The place where you want to trade and it.Has all the value basically right the.First in terms of the liquidity ordering.And then all the second tier assets.Trade with each other but because.They're all low liquidity assets the.Aggregate liquidity is really low.There's no good asset in there no super.Liquid acid in there to provide a lot of.Liquidity and then anything that doesn't.Make it into that one has even worse.Liquidity globally and so basically it's.Like you know you have like the vc thing.Where it's like the first thing has to.Do better than all the other things the.Second thing has to be better than all.The other things except the first .And like.Is there anything so that's why I think.There wouldn't be more than five speed.X's right but I just it's it's a way to.I just I just don't want to put.Validators.In a position of having to like justify.Like particular assets I imagine that.Like there's a really popular asset and.It turns out to be a fraud and like you.Were operating a validator and you like.Voted to include that asset in the thing.Right so now are you liable for that.Like you could have chosen a good asset.And you you chose to make it easier for.People to buy this fraudulent asset like.What's your responsibility there. I'm not a legal expert but like.Probably very little like I don't.Think that you know american stock.Exchanges get listed when you know like.Sorry american stock exchanges get sued.Over listing well nobody is but that's.That's a good example the stock.Exchanges have like relatively stringent. requirements for companies to get.Listed and when the companies don't.Comply they get de-listed right so we're.Now putting so if we if we use that.Analogy now validators are actually.Required to police these assets right.And to you know.Potentially making sure that they're.Disclosing things and whatever because.Otherwise they bear some responsibility.That is a good point and it's also.Possible we would get validators just.Like not paying attention and voting no.On everything so they don't have this.Liability. and then we wouldn't have any assets.In speedx.So at this point we only have two.Minutes left and I think what I want to.Make sure that we do is it seems like.There are some actions that need to.Happen between now and the next time.That we need to move this long and.Principally.David I think it falls to you.Because it sounds like you want to come.Up with some sort of concrete.Explanation of another way to.Determine or at least try.Let's try yeah.Is it so so that's sort of something.That you're gonna work on is there.Anything else that needs to happen.After this meeting in order to keep the.Conversation going forward or is it.Primarily we should move all the.Extension units to the top of the.Structure I'm not never gonna vote to.Prove another proposal on which the ext.Fields aren't like the first one in the.Structure but that's not a huge ask i.Right do some housekeeping we should do.But for the speedx configuration.Proposal like I believe from everything.I've heard.It's it's time to see if david can come.Up with an alternative concrete proposal.Right and maybe we can meet offline or.Something maybe john and jeff we could.Like talk at some point yeah.This afternoon or what.And .And likewise i'll like I actually have.Some like intrigue about the proposal i.Made quite a bit earlier about like the.You know take the stuff from the.Transaction set and then use the issuers.List to fill out the set. i'll write something up on the.Mailing list about that too to kind of.Give like a full overview of how that.Would work and why I think it's not a.Terrible idea.I think it fits somewhere in between.Some of these other proposals and.David's proposals so.All right perfect so we'll look forward.To that stuff and obviously the sooner.That you can get it done.Ideally if there's something for people.To read with enough time in advance for.The meeting so like there's just you.Know the meeting is two weeks two weeks.Yeah yeah.That's ideal all right cool thanks.Everybody thanks everyone for watching.If you want to follow along there's a.Link there for the Stellar dev mailing.List that's where these discussions.Happen asynchronously so please join and.Watch the discussion unfold and.Contribute if you have good ideas.Everybody thanks so much bye.
