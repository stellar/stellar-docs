Affectionately calling kale fail and Tyler really loves that name fail and Tyler really loves that name. Fail and Tyler really loves that name he's super excited about it and it's he's super excited about it and it's. He's super excited about it and it's just sort of a riff a spin if you will just sort of a riff a spin if you will. Just sort of a riff a spin if you will on this this kale asset that Tyler's on this this kale asset that Tyler's. On this this kale asset that Tyler's put together and so right now it is put together and so right now it is. Put together and so right now it is essentially a trading contract and this essentially a trading contract and this. Essentially a trading contract and this contract makes it possible for you to contract makes it possible for you to. Contract makes it possible for you to send kale just like his farming site you send kale just like his farming site you. Send kale just like his farming site you can sign up here with a smart wallet can sign up here with a smart wallet. Can sign up here with a smart wallet it'll give you a smart wallet and you it'll give you a smart wallet and you. It'll give you a smart wallet and you can put some kale into that contract can put some kale into that contract. Can put some kale into that contract into your smart wallet and then you can into your smart wallet and then you can. Into your smart wallet and then you can trade it for right now we've got trade it for right now we've got. Trade it for right now we've got broccoli we've got cabbage we've got broccoli we've got cabbage we've got. Broccoli we've got cabbage we've got kabi if you don't know the farming kabi if you don't know the farming. Kabi if you don't know the farming lingo those are all different lingo those are all different. Lingo those are all different cultivars of the same species of plant cultivars of the same species of plant. Cultivars of the same species of plant as kale it's like really they're all the as kale it's like really they're all the. As kale it's like really they're all the same thing which is why it's always same thing which is why it's always. Same thing which is why it's always tradable one to one and so I'm going to tradable one to one and so I'm going to. Tradable one to one and so I'm going to send like a 100 kale let's get some send like a 100 kale let's get some. Send like a 100 kale let's get some broccoli back make the Trade sign with broccoli back make the Trade sign with. Broccoli back make the Trade sign with your smart your smart your smart wallet and then it thinks for a second. Wallet and then it thinks for a second wallet and then it thinks for a second and it thinks for a second longer and it. And it thinks for a second longer and it and it thinks for a second longer and it. Thinks for one more second and 105 kale I mean broccoli now second and 105 kale I mean broccoli now. In my wallet let's do the same thing in my wallet let's do the same thing in my wallet let's do the same thing. With with with cabbage and it's essentially just the cabbage and it's essentially just the. Cabbage and it's essentially just the smart contract is holding on to the kale smart contract is holding on to the kale.

Complicated wallet access or anything complicated wallet access or anything complicated wallet access or anything. Like that just use just Ed the a pass like that just use just Ed the a pass like that just use just Ed the a pass. Key so so this is actually it's a good key so so this is actually it's a good key so so this is actually it's a good. Example if if if developers want to example if if if developers want to example if if if developers want to. play around and see what what can you play around and see what what can you. play around and see what what can you what can you build on on on on Stellar what can you build on on on on Stella. What can you build on on on on Stellar and with soran and and how is this build and with soran and and how is this build. And with soran and and how is this build because underneath all the the the fun because underneath all the the the fun. Because underneath all the the the fun stuff it is actually a defi application stuff it is actually a defi application.

So it's like this pay Master service that really abstracts the gas fees that really abstracts the gas fees. That really abstracts the gas fees sequence numbers transaction envelopes sequence numbers transaction envelopes. Sequence numbers transaction envelopes all the like difficult things about all the like difficult things about. All the like difficult things about building on Stellar sometimes is like building on Stellar sometimes is like. Building on Stellar sometimes is like just taken care of and so like no fees just taken care of and so like no fees. Just taken care of and so like no fees come out of this come out of my smart come out of this come out of my smart. Come out of this come out of my smart wallet wallet wallet same is true for when you're mining kale. Same is true for when you're mining kale same is true for when you're mining kale. It's all done through launch tube and it's all done through launch tube and it's all done through launch tube and. It's just this incredible opportunity to it's just this incredible opportunity to. It's just this incredible opportunity to use these smart wallets to like just use these smart wallets to like just. Use these smart wallets to like just have a wallet that you can like hand to have a wallet that you can like hand to. Have a wallet that you can like hand to somebody you don't have to tell them somebody you don't have to tell them. Somebody you don't have to tell them like okay now buy lumens from coinbase like okay now buy lumens from coinbase. Like okay now buy lumens from coinbase and do this to get your wallet set up and do this to get your wallet set up. And do this to get your wallet set up it's just ready for users to actually it's just ready for users to actually. It's just ready for users to actually use so yeah you you just mentioned use so yeah you you just mentioned. Use so yeah you you just mentioned launch tube and maybe if if everyone launch tube and maybe if if everyone. Launch tube and maybe if if everyone is not familiar with what launch tube is is not familiar with what launch tube is. Is not familiar with what launch tube is can you maybe go into yeah little bit of. Can you maybe go into yeah little bit of can you maybe go into yeah little bit of. Details how you're using launch tube and details how you're using launch tube and. Details how you're using launch tube and what role it plays in this yeah so what role it plays in this yeah so. What role it plays in this yeah so launch tube is a service that we're kind launch tube is a service that we're kind. Launch tube is a service that we're kind of pioneering to make it easier for of pioneering to make it easier for. Of pioneering to make it easier for applications and developers to build applications and developers to build . Applications and developers to build applications that use Stellar like when applications that use Stellar like when. Applications that use Stellar like when you are trying to build a transaction you are trying to build a transaction. You are trying to build a transaction you need a sequence number you need an you need a sequence number you need an. You need a sequence number you need an account to pay that sequence number you account to pay that sequence number you. Account to pay that sequence number you need a balance to pay those fees you need a balance to pay those fees you. Need a balance to pay those fees you need a Base reserve held in the wallet need a Base reserve held in the wallet. Need a Base reserve held in the wallet like one Lumen minimum to like make sure like one Lumen minimum to like make sure. Like one Lumen minimum to like make sure that your account is active like a that your account is active like a. That your account is active like a minimum balance requirement at some minimum balance requirement at some. Minimum balance requirement at some banks and all that can kind of be a banks and all that can kind of be a. Banks and all that can kind of be a pain for a developer if you're trying to pain for a developer if you're trying to. Pain for a developer if you're trying to get users set up on their wallet so that. Get users set up on their wallet so that get users set up on their wallet so that. They can actually interact with the they can actually interact with the they can actually interact with the. Blockchain so you got to either sponsor blockchain so you got to either sponsor blockchain so you got to either sponsor. Or give them one Lumen to satisfy That or give them one Lumen to satisfy That or give them one Lumen to satisfy That. Base reserve you have to pay whatever Base reserve you have to pay whatever. Base reserve you have to pay whatever fees for those transactions to fees for those transactions to. Fees for those transactions to actually hit the network launch tube actually hit the network launch tube. Actually hit the network launch tube though is in you get assigned though is in you get assigned. Though is in you get assigned transaction from the user using my pass transaction from the user using my pass. Transaction from the user using my pass key wallet for these examples and key wallet for these examples and. Key wallet for these examples and then you send that transaction to launch then you send that transaction to launch. Then you send that transaction to launch tube and launch tube will take care of tube and launch tube will take care of. Tube and launch tube will take care of the sequence number the fee the sequence number the fee. The sequence number the fee paid all like the developer has to worry paid all like the developer has to worry. Paid all like the developer has to worry about is getting a like a token with about is getting a like a token with. About is getting a like a token with valid launch tube credits on it and valid launch tube credits on it and. Valid launch tube credits on it and that's super easy barely an that's super easy barely an. That's super easy barely an inconvenience if you go to test net. Inconvenience if you go to test net.
