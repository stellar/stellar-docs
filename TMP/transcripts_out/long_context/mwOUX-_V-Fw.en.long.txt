Okay I think that we can we can start okay I think that we can we can start again good morning everyone in latin. Again good morning everyone in latin again good morning everyone in latin america welcome to today's panel that we. America welcome to today's panel that we america welcome to today's panel that we. Call it call it call it innovating colombian financial system innovating colombian financial system. Innovating colombian financial system I'm gabriel bisama I lead international I'm gabriel bisama I lead international. I'm gabriel bisama I lead international policy at the Stellar development policy at the Stellar development. Policy at the Stellar development foundation foundation foundation and today we have three experienced. And today we have three experienced and today we have three experienced panelists that. Panelists that panelists that we are going to discuss the we are going to discuss the. We are going to discuss the opportunities and challenges of using opportunities and challenges of using. Opportunities and challenges of using blockchain technology for cross-border blockchain technology for cross-border. Blockchain technology for cross-border payments payments payments and and and specifically what we are going to. Specifically what we are going to specifically what we are going to discuss is discuss is. Discuss is how the use of blockchain technology and how the use of blockchain technology and. How the use of blockchain technology and stablecoins can expand the access and stablecoins can expand the access and. Stablecoins can expand the access and usage of affordable financial services usage of affordable financial services. Usage of affordable financial services and and and how how how actually they could provide a positive. Actually they could provide a positive actually they could provide a positive impact to inclusion and economy by. Impact to inclusion and economy by impact to inclusion and economy by contributing reducing the cost of. Contributing reducing the cost of contributing reducing the cost of cross-border payments so I think that. Cross-border payments so I think that cross-border payments so I think that everyone here that connect to this panel. Everyone here that connect to this panel everyone here that connect to this panel. They know that the average cost of of they know that the average cost of of. They know that the average cost of of cross-border payments remains very high cross-border payments remains very high. Cross-border payments remains very high right now right now right now so it amounts to almost six percent. so it amounts to almost six percent so it amounts to almost six percent of the amount that you send. Of the amount that you send of the amount that you send which is more than the double of the . Which is more than the double of the which is more than the double of the sustainable development goals target. Sustainable development goals target sustainable development goals target that is actually three percent. That is actually three percent that is actually three percent so so this high cost of remittances. so so this high cost of remittances so so this high cost of remittances payments have real world impacts on. Payments have real world impacts on payments have real world impacts on individuals and small businesses. Individuals and small businesses individuals and small businesses so for example high costs impact. So for example high costs impact so for example high costs impact migrants migrants. Migrants seeking to some money home for for their seeking to some money home for for their. Seeking to some money home for for their families also small businesses important. Families also small businesses important families also small businesses important. Products from foreign suppliers products from foreign suppliers products from foreign suppliers. And non-profit organizations such as and non-profit organizations such as and non-profit organizations such as. Eight organizations that are actually eight organizations that are actually eight organizations that are actually. There this person fans for there this person fans for there this person fans for. Humanitarian aid humanitarian aid humanitarian aid so blockchain technology and and the. So blockchain technology and and the so blockchain technology and and the responsible. Responsible responsible design and use of of stable coins design and use of of stable coins. Design and use of of stable coins could enable could enable could enable more affordable cross-border payments. More affordable cross-border payments more affordable cross-border payments including remittances but also b2b. Including remittances but also b2b including remittances but also b2b payments payments. Payments that finalize in in seconds and and that finalize in in seconds and and that finalize in in seconds and and. Actually cause fractions of a cent actually cause fractions of a cent actually cause fractions of a cent . Mainly due to the reduction of of mainly due to the reduction of of mainly due to the reduction of of. Intermediation so today we are going to intermediation so today we are going to intermediation so today we are going to. Get into the details of on on a project get into the details of on on a project get into the details of on on a project. That we are doing in in colombia with that we are doing in in colombia with that we are doing in in colombia with. Two ecosystem partners of of the Stellar two ecosystem partners of of the Stellar. Two ecosystem partners of of the Stellar development foundation and also we development foundation and also we. Development foundation and also we will have will have will have diana from from the latin american. Diana from from the latin american diana from from the latin american development bank to speak a little. Development bank to speak a little development bank to speak a little bit about. Bit about bit about how to embed financial education into how to embed financial education into. How to embed financial education into the consumer experience the consumer experience. The consumer experience but before getting into but before getting into but before getting into. the details and discussions with with the details and discussions with with. the details and discussions with with the panelists the panelists the panelists. I just want to I just want to I just want to give you a brief overview and intro to. Give you a brief overview and intro to give you a brief overview and intro to the Stellar network for those who are. The Stellar network for those who are the Stellar network for those who are not familiar with with it. Not familiar with with it not familiar with with it so Stellar is an open blockchain with. so Stellar is an open blockchain with so Stellar is an open blockchain with. Control capabilities for for issuers and control capabilities for for issuers and. Control capabilities for for issuers and what does this mean so actually is is. What does this mean so actually is is what does this mean so actually is is. A blockchain is a network that actually a blockchain is a network that actually a blockchain is a network that actually. Gives on the one hand controls to asset gives on the one hand controls to asset gives on the one hand controls to asset. Issuers that issuers that issuers that ensures ensures ensures safety and security of a permission or. Safety and security of a permission or safety and security of a permission or closed network but at the same time it. Closed network but at the same time it closed network but at the same time it leverage openness and interpretivity . Leverage openness and interpretivity leverage openness and interpretivity that foster competition innovation and. That foster competition innovation and that foster competition innovation and inclusion. Inclusion inclusion and the some examples of this just to and the some examples of this just to. And the some examples of this just to give you some some clear examples is is give you some some clear examples is is. Give you some some clear examples is is aml and cft features and and clovax so aml and cft features and and clovax so. Aml and cft features and and clovax so something that is called authorization something that is called authorization. Something that is called authorization require is is a flag that require is is a flag that. Require is is a flag that it could be it could be it could be when you when an asset is your. When you when an asset is your when you when an asset is your issues an asset it could he could. Issues an asset it could he could issues an asset it could he could make sure that that it has this aml and. Make sure that that it has this aml and make sure that that it has this aml and cfd feature that. Cfd feature that cfd feature that ensures that a financial entity when ensures that a financial entity when. Ensures that a financial entity when he's distributing an asset he's distributing an asset. He's distributing an asset identifies who is the holder of that identifies who is the holder of that. Identifies who is the holder of that asset asset asset and this would gives controls to. And this would gives controls to and this would gives controls to actually to the issuer that. Actually to the issuer that actually to the issuer that that aml and cft regulations are being. That aml and cft regulations are being that aml and cft regulations are being comply with so so we think that aml. Comply with so so we think that aml comply with so so we think that aml and cft is important but also clawbacks. And cft is important but also clawbacks and cft is important but also clawbacks are important. Are important are important so if an asset issuer such as a so if an asset issuer such as a. So if an asset issuer such as a regulated financial entity or a fintech regulated financial entity or a fintech. Regulated financial entity or a fintech or a digital wallet or even a central or a digital wallet or even a central. Or a digital wallet or even a central bank bank bank that issues a cbdc that issues a cbdc. That issues a cbdc actually include this this flag on on actually include this this flag on on. Actually include this this flag on on the asset gives the possibility of the asset gives the possibility of . The asset gives the possibility of to the issuer to recover the funds in to the issuer to recover the funds in. To the issuer to recover the funds in the event of a fraud for example but the event of a fraud for example but. The event of a fraud for example but this is not only relevant because of this is not only relevant because of. This is not only relevant because of in the case of fraudulent transactions in the case of fraudulent transactions. In the case of fraudulent transactions but also is relevant if for example but also is relevant if for example. But also is relevant if for example any a user any a user any a user loss lose the the private keys so we. Loss lose the the private keys so we loss lose the the private keys so we think that that clawbacks are really. Think that that clawbacks are really think that that clawbacks are really important. Important important and just to step back a little bit and and just to step back a little bit and. And just to step back a little bit and someday downstair it was established someday downstair it was established. Someday downstair it was established in in 2014 and so so actually it's one in in 2014 and so so actually it's one. In in 2014 and so so actually it's one of the blockchains that is of the blockchains that is. Of the blockchains that is most established and it's designed or it most established and it's designed or it. Most established and it's designed or it was designed for for payments like the was designed for for payments like the. Was designed for for payments like the main use case right now on on seller is main use case right now on on seller is. Main use case right now on on seller is crossword payments but also crossword payments but also. Crossword payments but also we are working in other use cases such we are working in other use cases such. We are working in other use cases such as cbdc's and using blockchain for as cbdc's and using blockchain for. As cbdc's and using blockchain for distributing humanitarian aid since distributing humanitarian aid since. Distributing humanitarian aid since it launched the network process more it launched the network process more. It launched the network process more than 2.6 billion transactions than 2.6 billion transactions. Than 2.6 billion transactions and currently is processing more than and currently is processing more than. And currently is processing more than six million transactions in a day-to-day six million transactions in a day-to-day. Six million transactions in a day-to-day basis basis basis the other piece that is important if. the other piece that is important if the other piece that is important if you would like to promote the use of. You would like to promote the use of you would like to promote the use of blockchain technology that could as. Blockchain technology that could as blockchain technology that could as well promote financial inclusion we need. Well promote financial inclusion we need well promote financial inclusion we need. To make sure that the technology is to make sure that the technology is to make sure that the technology is. Sustainable so sustainable so sustainable so one of the things that one of the things that. One of the things that we would like to make sure is actually we would like to make sure is actually. We would like to make sure is actually that the technology yeah that the technology yeah. That the technology yeah it doesn't consume a lot of energy so we it doesn't consume a lot of energy so we. It doesn't consume a lot of energy so we are in in the next couple of weeks we are in in the next couple of weeks we.

Importantly we are very excited about importantly we are very excited about importantly we are very excited about. Our partnership with Stellar because our partnership with Stellar because our partnership with Stellar because. They recognize they recognize they recognize that there is a need for a consistency.

Company are actually former global regulators whether they be with the us regulators whether they be with the us. Regulators whether they be with the us or others by my part for example I spent or others by my part for example I spent. Or others by my part for example I spent the early part of my career at the u.s the early part of my career at the u.s. The early part of my career at the u.s treasury department working with treasury department working with. Treasury department working with institutions like the fatf on anti-money institutions like the fatf on anti-money. Institutions like the fatf on anti-money laundering frameworks so the advent of laundering frameworks so the advent of. Laundering frameworks so the advent of the Stellar ecosystem and blockchain the Stellar ecosystem and blockchain. The Stellar ecosystem and blockchain enabling tools that that facilitate a enabling tools that that facilitate a. Enabling tools that that facilitate a much faster efficient cross-border much faster efficient cross-border. Much faster efficient cross-border payments ecosystem is exciting in that payments ecosystem is exciting in that. Payments ecosystem is exciting in that regard but they all need compliance in regard but they all need compliance in. Regard but they all need compliance in that regard we therefore are also an that regard we therefore are also an. That regard we therefore are also an anchor on the Stellar blockchain and and anchor on the Stellar blockchain and and. Anchor on the Stellar blockchain and and the fintech side is we provide the fintech side is we provide. The fintech side is we provide connectivity for those payments into the connectivity for those payments into the. Connectivity for those payments into the us traditional banking and payments us traditional banking and payments. Us traditional banking and payments ecosystem ach payments wire payments and ecosystem ach payments wire payments and. Ecosystem ach payments wire payments and the like so we can connect with yvonne's. The like so we can connect with yvonne's the like so we can connect with yvonne's. Team and the customers that they are team and the customers that they are team and the customers that they are. Working with to facilitate cross-border working with to facilitate cross-border working with to facilitate cross-border. Payments for household remittances small payments for household remittances small. Payments for household remittances small business payments and the like and business payments and the like and. Business payments and the like and enable on and off ramping for assets enable on and off ramping for assets. Enable on and off ramping for assets that are transacted on the Stellar that are transacted on the Stellar. That are transacted on the Stellar blockchain for example like usdc that blockchain for example like usdc that. Blockchain for example like usdc that may come inbound to counterparts to be may come inbound to counterparts to be. May come inbound to counterparts to be paid in the u.s where we can then paid in the u.s where we can then. Paid in the u.s where we can then off-ramp to the u.s payment system and off-ramp to the u.s payment system and. Off-ramp to the u.s payment system and then push or pull funds then push or pull funds. Then push or pull funds using ach or wires and as well as using ach or wires and as well as. Using ach or wires and as well as outbound flows as well so we we perform outbound flows as well so we we perform. Outbound flows as well so we we perform two key functions we're a gateway two key functions we're a gateway . Two key functions we're a gateway between traditional financial and between traditional financial and. Between traditional financial and banking ecosystems in the united states banking ecosystems in the united states. Banking ecosystems in the united states to be able to hold funds in accounts to be able to hold funds in accounts. To be able to hold funds in accounts with our partner banks in the u.s access with our partner banks in the u.s access. With our partner banks in the u.s access those ach and wire rails and then be those ach and wire rails and then be. Those ach and wire rails and then be able to on and off ramp for payments able to on and off ramp for payments. Able to on and off ramp for payments using the global Stellar blockchain using the global Stellar blockchain. Using the global Stellar blockchain ecosystem and working with partners like ecosystem and working with partners like. Ecosystem and working with partners like yvonne to really connect the latin yvonne to really connect the latin. Yvonne to really connect the latin american american american business and household community in. Business and household community in business and household community in their cross-border payments needs and by. Their cross-border payments needs and by their cross-border payments needs and by. Doing so we enable a very consistent doing so we enable a very consistent doing so we enable a very consistent. Approach by also providing approach by also providing approach by also providing some proprietary capabilities around. Some proprietary capabilities around some proprietary capabilities around compliance backed digital identity. Compliance backed digital identity compliance backed digital identity credentials for clients that come into. Credentials for clients that come into credentials for clients that come into the ecosystem that provides great. The ecosystem that provides great the ecosystem that provides great efficiencies when we do kyc support. Efficiencies when we do kyc support efficiencies when we do kyc support because of these often are very. Because of these often are very because of these often are very redundant so we can issue and validate. Redundant so we can issue and validate redundant so we can issue and validate compliance-backed verifiable digital. compliance-backed verifiable digital compliance-backed verifiable digital credentials for clients within that. Credentials for clients within that credentials for clients within that ecosystem so as different nodes. Ecosystem so as different nodes ecosystem so as different nodes originate their clients they can have. Originate their clients they can have originate their clients they can have one kyc gateway and be able to have a. One kyc gateway and be able to have a one kyc gateway and be able to have a utility in the ecosystem while. Utility in the ecosystem while utility in the ecosystem while importantly also protecting their. Importantly also protecting their importantly also protecting their privacy and so the combination of these. Privacy and so the combination of these privacy and so the combination of these compliance tools with the the blockchain. Compliance tools with the the blockchain compliance tools with the the blockchain. Elements that associate payments flows elements that associate payments flows elements that associate payments flows. Between digital assets and fiat assets between digital assets and fiat assets between digital assets and fiat assets. With this on and off ramp capability is with this on and off ramp capability is with this on and off ramp capability is. Where we sit and we're excited about where we sit and we're excited about where we sit and we're excited about . Participating in growing the ecosystem participating in growing the ecosystem participating in growing the ecosystem. And really driving cross-border payments and really driving cross-border payments. And really driving cross-border payments in a much more efficient but also secure. In a much more efficient but also secure in a much more efficient but also secure. And compliant way you very much for that amir and you very much for that amir and. Inclusivis is a really good example on inclusivis is a really good example on inclusivis is a really good example on. On how financial entities are on how financial entities are on how financial entities are. Connected to Stellar I actually connected to Stellar I actually connected to Stellar I actually. Care a lot about aml cfd and compliance care a lot about aml cfd and compliance care a lot about aml cfd and compliance. So I'm really happy to to to to hear so I'm really happy to to to to hear so I'm really happy to to to to hear . All of all that I mean all of all that I mean all of all that I mean is going to to tell us today.

Issues that I would like to ask to to issues that I would like to ask to to issues that I would like to ask to to. The anna in terms of personal finance the anna in terms of personal finance the anna in terms of personal finance. And financial education so we we have and financial education so we we have and financial education so we we have. Spoken a lot about benefits and spoken a lot about benefits and spoken a lot about benefits and. Opportunities opportunities opportunities but in this context we're actually in. but in this context we're actually in but in this context we're actually in. Order to order to order to send money for example from the u.s to send money for example from the u.s to. Send money for example from the u.s to colombia you need maybe a smartphone you colombia you need maybe a smartphone you. Colombia you need maybe a smartphone you need connectivity need connectivity . Need connectivity how how do you think that financial how how do you think that financial. How how do you think that financial education and financial literacy and education and financial literacy and. Education and financial literacy and also digital literacy is relevant for also digital literacy is relevant for. Also digital literacy is relevant for for someone who is receiving money in in for someone who is receiving money in in. For someone who is receiving money in in colombia and and how would you approach colombia and and how would you approach. Colombia and and how would you approach actually actually actually financial education in this context. Financial education in this context financial education in this context yes thank you gabriel I think that. Yes thank you gabriel I think that yes thank you gabriel I think that. we need to think to think first we need to think to think first . we need to think to think first what is financial education what is financial education . what is financial education because I mean because I mean because I mean. Just traditionally financial just traditionally financial just traditionally financial. Education programs education programs education programs have been built on the assumption that. Have been built on the assumption that have been built on the assumption that transferring information to. transferring information to transferring information to financial consumers about how to use. Financial consumers about how to use financial consumers about how to use financial products would lead to better. Financial products would lead to better financial products would lead to better choices. Choices choices and improved financial health however and improved financial health however. And improved financial health however evidence from numerous impact evidence from numerous impact. evidence from numerous impact evaluations evaluations evaluations over the past decade suggests that. over the past decade suggests that over the past decade suggests that this assumption is flawed and there. This assumption is flawed and there this assumption is flawed and there is a growing body of evidence showing. Is a growing body of evidence showing is a growing body of evidence showing that interventions designed using. That interventions designed using that interventions designed using principles from with behavioral. Principles from with behavioral principles from with behavioral economics are more likely to improve. Economics are more likely to improve economics are more likely to improve people's money management behavior. People's money management behavior people's money management behavior than other interventions so. Than other interventions so than other interventions so financial inclusion we we we at cap. Financial inclusion we we we at cap financial inclusion we we we at cap are working on programs on the. Are working on programs on the are working on programs on the improvement on financial inclusion and. Improvement on financial inclusion and improvement on financial inclusion and we see that. We see that we see that this requires financially capable this requires financially capable. This requires financially capable customers who actively use products for customers who actively use products for. Customers who actively use products for their benefits their benefits their benefits. And the ultimate goal of financial and the ultimate goal of financial and the ultimate goal of financial. Education programs is to help develop education programs is to help develop education programs is to help develop. Financially capable customers financially capable customers financially capable customers. Those with the with the attitudes the those with the with the attitudes the those with the with the attitudes the. Knowledge the skills and behaviors to knowledge the skills and behaviors to knowledge the skills and behaviors to. Make financial decisions to improve make financial decisions to improve make financial decisions to improve. Their lives their lives their lives and there is also evidence that shows and there is also evidence that shows. And there is also evidence that shows that higher levels of financial that higher levels of financial. That higher levels of financial capabilities are related to greater capabilities are related to greater. Capabilities are related to greater levels of financial well-being or levels of financial well-being or. Levels of financial well-being or financial financial financial health health health. Through financial attitudes skills and through financial attitudes skills and through financial attitudes skills and. Behavior such as a savings behavior behavior such as a savings behavior behavior such as a savings behavior. Previous own experience with the previous own experience with the previous own experience with the.

Personal participation or involvement in the in the in the financial decisions of. The in the in the financial decisions of the in the in the financial decisions of. The household among others so we see the household among others so we see the household among others so we see. That for example this project that for example this project that for example this project . Could benefit a lot could benefit a lot could benefit a lot from from . From incorporating incorporating incorporating financial education from this . Financial education from this financial education from this behavior perspective I mean taking. Behavior perspective I mean taking behavior perspective I mean taking into account the needs of the the. Into account the needs of the the into account the needs of the the customer needs and their behavior and. Customer needs and their behavior and customer needs and their behavior and incorporating these kind of notches. Incorporating these kind of notches incorporating these kind of notches that will will help the the customer. That will will help the the customer that will will help the the customer or the remittance receiver to improve. Or the remittance receiver to improve or the remittance receiver to improve. Their savings behavior for example their savings behavior for example . Their savings behavior for example so we we see this as a as a so we we see this as a as a. So we we see this as a as a very important opportunity to very important opportunity to. Very important opportunity to incorporate these financial incorporate these financial . Incorporate these financial education evidence into into into education evidence into into into. Education evidence into into into into this this product in in colombia yeah I totally agree with that I mean. Yeah I totally agree with that I mean if actually you if actually you if actually you. You need to make sure that you need to make sure that you need to make sure that when you approach financial education. When you approach financial education when you approach financial education you can you you can help. You can you you can help you can you you can help individuals and and adults to individuals and and adults to. Individuals and and adults to to improve their financial to improve their financial. to improve their financial capabilities and and therefore their capabilities and and therefore their. Capabilities and and therefore their financial health by by changing behavior financial health by by changing behavior. Financial health by by changing behavior so so so I think that this is this is the the. I think that this is this is the the I think that this is this is the the approach that evidence tell us and. Approach that evidence tell us and approach that evidence tell us and I'm happy to to hear that the latin. I'm happy to to hear that the latin I'm happy to to hear that the latin american development bank is working on. American development bank is working on american development bank is working on that as well and and can also contribute. That as well and and can also contribute that as well and and can also contribute. To to do this to this project so to to do this to this project so to to do this to this project so. moving forward in terms of moving forward in terms of moving forward in terms of. not only what is going on in colombia not only what is going on in colombia. Not only what is going on in colombia but but also what is going on in in but but also what is going on in in.
