Can facilitate payments inside that and but before but before we get into but before but before we get into. but before but before we get into payments obviously we need to be able to payments obviously we need to be able to. Payments obviously we need to be able to on-ramp onchain so at the hackathon on-ramp onchain so at the hackathon. On-ramp onchain so at the hackathon we buildt the on- ramping solution and we buildt the on- ramping solution and. We buildt the on- ramping solution and we kind of have iterated a number of we kind of have iterated a number of. we kind of have iterated a number of I don't want to say pivot because I don't want to say pivot because. I don't want to say pivot because pivot usually to me see sounds like it pivot usually to me see sounds like it. Pivot usually to me see sounds like it you were doing something now you're you were doing something now you're. You were doing something now you're doing something else I think we just re doing something else I think we just re. Doing something else I think we just re refined and reiterated in our idea to to refined and reiterated in our idea to to. Refined and reiterated in our idea to to hit both I mean I it's to hit both hit both I mean I it's to hit both. Hit both I mean I it's to hit both functionality and revenue and those functionality and revenue and those. Functionality and revenue and those are two are two are two important pieces of any business and I. Important pieces of any business and I important pieces of any business and I think we I think we're finally at a. Think we I think we're finally at a think we I think we're finally at a point where they're they're put together. Point where they're they're put together point where they're they're put together. And it it makes and it it makes and it it makes sense okay we were trying to get . Sense okay we were trying to get sense okay we were trying to get to get a screen share going did you get. To get a screen share going did you get to get a screen share going did you get it to work yeah let's I think so . It to work yeah let's I think so it to work yeah let's I think so . It would be fun to see see it in action it would be fun to see see it in action it would be fun to see see it in action. Yeah so I guess let me start with the yeah so I guess let me start with the. Yeah so I guess let me start with the so rent me Daddy is a telegram wallet. So rent me Daddy is a telegram wallet so rent me Daddy is a telegram wallet.

I think there's a big strategy to how you roll things out because you can you roll things out because you can. You roll things out because you can spend all of this time and then roll spend all of this time and then roll. Spend all of this time and then roll out a product and then start driving out a product and then start driving. Out a product and then start driving traffic to that product when it's traffic to that product when it's. Traffic to that product when it's live we decided to take a different live we decided to take a different. Live we decided to take a different approach we decided to roll out a teaser approach we decided to roll out a teaser. Approach we decided to roll out a teaser game inside telegram it's a very game inside telegram it's a very. Game inside telegram it's a very simple game you just guess if the simple game you just guess if the. Simple game you just guess if the Bitcoin price is going to go up or down Bitcoin price is going to go up or down.
