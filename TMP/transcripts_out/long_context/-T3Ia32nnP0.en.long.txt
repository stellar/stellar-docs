So we've done quite a  Great. Thank you. So we've done quite a.  Great. Thank you. So we've done quite a few hackathons this year and it's. Few hackathons this year and it's few hackathons this year and it's really great to see that some of the. Really great to see that some of the really great to see that some of the developers they're starting to use open. Developers they're starting to use open developers they're starting to use open sin software and the the libraries. Sin software and the the libraries sin software and the the libraries and the tooling. and I think what. And the tooling. and I think what and the tooling. and I think what what you're going to show today is going. What you're going to show today is going what you're going to show today is going. To be really interesting for a lot of to be really interesting for a lot of to be really interesting for a lot of. Developers. So if you have a developers. So if you have a developers. So if you have a. Presentation you can share. Yeah, there it is. Sorry. Sorry about Yeah, there it is. Sorry. Sorry about that. , yeah. So. That. , yeah. So that. , yeah. So I'm going to present to you today the I'm going to present to you today the. I'm going to present to you today the [clears throat] [clears throat] [clears throat]. smart account framework that we smart account framework that we smart account framework that we. created with released with the created with released with the created with released with the. Latest u latest release of of our latest u latest release of of our latest u latest release of of our. Library. Library. Library. just to to mention that yeah just to to mention that yeah. just to to mention that yeah already a month ago when with some of already a month ago when with some of. Already a month ago when with some of you we met at at Meridian in in you we met at at Meridian in in. You we met at at Meridian in in Rio. how excited I was and I Rio. how excited I was and I I. Rio. how excited I was and I guess it was the case for everyone to guess it was the case for everyone to. Guess it was the case for everyone to use pass keys to have all this use pass keys to have all this . Use pass keys to have all this like wallet experience abstracted into like wallet experience abstracted into. Like wallet experience abstracted into into into smart account. So our into into smart account. So our. Into into smart account. So our ambition is to make this the new normal ambition is to make this the new normal. Ambition is to make this the new normal for Stellar. So yeah we are building for Stellar. So yeah we are building. For Stellar. So yeah we are building this framework u with with that in this framework u with with that in. This framework u with with that in mind. So without further ado yeah mind. So without further ado yeah. Mind. So without further ado yeah let's dive in. first let's dive in. first. Let's dive in. first a point about naming and why we chose a point about naming and why we chose. a point about naming and why we chose smart account and not smart wallet. Smart account and not smart wallet. Smart account and not smart wallet. first [clears throat] the storebone first [clears throat] the storebone first [clears throat] the storebone. SDK defines custom account and custom SDK defines custom account and custom. SDK defines custom account and custom account interface and our design builds account interface and our design builds. Account interface and our design builds on top of it. So that's why we we on top of it. So that's why we we. On top of it. So that's why we we decided to to choose smart account as decided to to choose smart account as. Decided to to choose smart account as a as a naming and yeah smart account a as a naming and yeah smart account. A as a naming and yeah smart account must implement this interface. Must implement this interface. Must implement this interface. then why smart accounts are then why smart accounts are then why smart accounts are . Necessary? let's just explore a very necessary? let's just explore a very necessary? let's just explore a very. Simple scenario. Simple scenario. Simple scenario. where a smart account that holds where a smart account that holds . Where a smart account that holds some funible tokens some funible tokens some funible tokens. And the owner of the contract wants and the owner of the contract wants and the owner of the contract wants. To transfer some amount and that's why to transfer some amount and that's why to transfer some amount and that's why. They need to call a function on the USDC they need to call a function on the USDC. They need to call a function on the USDC contract. In this case, contract. In this case,. Contract. In this case, they will make use of a cryptographic they will make use of a cryptographic. they will make use of a cryptographic key that is registered at this smart key that is registered at this smart. Key that is registered at this smart account to authorize the the account to authorize the the. Account to authorize the the operation. Operation. Operation. And by looking from this perspective, we And by looking from this perspective, we. And by looking from this perspective, we the perspective of account abraction,. the perspective of account abraction, the perspective of account abraction,. We we are establishing a boundary we we are establishing a boundary we we are establishing a boundary. Between the account that holds the sets between the account that holds the sets between the account that holds the sets. And the keys that that control them. And the keys that that control them. And the keys that that control them. now let's try to define what a smart now let's try to define what a smart now let's try to define what a smart. Account is. So let's this is a smart account is. So let's this is a smart account is. So let's this is a smart. Contract first and foremost that contract first and foremost that contract first and foremost that. Composes authorization intents that are composes authorization intents that are composes authorization intents that are. Coming from multiple sources and this coming from multiple sources and this. Coming from multiple sources and this high level definition will guide us high level definition will guide us. High level definition will guide us through the the the all the com the all through the the the all the com the all. Through the the the all the com the all the components of our framework. The components of our framework. The components of our framework. with this in mind, let's first see with this in mind, let's first see with this in mind, let's first see. What are what the authorization sources what are what the authorization sources what are what the authorization sources. Could be. as in the previous example, could be. as in the previous example,. Could be. as in the previous example, an authorization source could be a an authorization source could be a. An authorization source could be a cryptographic key or there could be cryptographic key or there could be. Cryptographic key or there could be multiple cryptographic keys for the multiple cryptographic keys for the. Multiple cryptographic keys for the same smart account or it could be a G same smart account or it could be a G. Same smart account or it could be a G account that authorizes on behalf of account that authorizes on behalf of . Account that authorizes on behalf of of the smart account or it could be any of the smart account or it could be any. Of the smart account or it could be any combination of of these cryptographic combination of of these cryptographic. Combination of of these cryptographic keys, G accounts or other smart accounts. Keys, G accounts or other smart accounts keys, G accounts or other smart accounts. And smart contracts. and smart contracts. and smart contracts. the next part of the definition. the next part of the definition the next part of the definition talked about authorization intents. . Talked about authorization intents. talked about authorization intents. what are and yeah we will see what are. What are and yeah we will see what are what are and yeah we will see what are the core elements of of the. The core elements of of the the core elements of of the authorization intent. Authorization intent. Authorization intent. we can examine this by answering we can examine this by answering we can examine this by answering. These three questions. We can define who these three questions. We can define who. These three questions. We can define who is allowed to act what are they is allowed to act what are they. Is allowed to act what are they allowed to do and how those permissions allowed to do and how those permissions. Allowed to do and how those permissions are enforced. are enforced. are enforced. who is allowed to act? This might be who is allowed to act? This might be who is allowed to act? This might be. Already clear. those could be some already clear. those could be some. Already clear. those could be some keys from different cryptographic keys from different cryptographic. Keys from different cryptographic curves also G accounts C accounts. Curves also G accounts C accounts. Curves also G accounts C accounts. what are they allowed to do? Well, what are they allowed to do? Well, what are they allowed to do? Well,. Here this can be literally any kind of here this can be literally any kind of here this can be literally any kind of. Action either a specific function on action either a specific function on action either a specific function on. A specific contract or just transfer a specific contract or just transfer a specific contract or just transfer. The transfer function on any SCP 41 the transfer function on any SCP 41 the transfer function on any SCP 41 . Compatible contract deploy deployments compatible contract deploy deployments compatible contract deploy deployments. As well. So yeah, any kind of action as well. So yeah, any kind of action as well. So yeah, any kind of action. how is this enforced also many how is this enforced also many how is this enforced also many. Different combinations are possible. It different combinations are possible. It different combinations are possible. It. Could be key one and key2. Key1 or key2 could be key one and key2. Key1 or key2 could be key one and key2. Key1 or key2. Key1 and some other conditions that are key1 and some other conditions that are key1 and some other conditions that are. Not derived from the from a not derived from the from a not derived from the from a. Cryptographic scheme cryptographic scheme cryptographic scheme and to give names to those groups. Who. And to give names to those groups. Who and to give names to those groups. Who is for signers? What is the scope and. Is for signers? What is the scope and is for signers? What is the scope and how how is for the policies? How how is for the policies? How how is for the policies? how do we compose those elements? how do we compose those elements? how do we compose those elements? So we have signers scope and policies So we have signers scope and policies. So we have signers scope and policies and we embed them in the entity called and we embed them in the entity called. And we embed them in the entity called context rule. here you see that context rule. here you see that. Context rule. here you see that besides the signer scope and the besides the signer scope and the. Besides the signer scope and the policies we also have the the notion of policies we also have the the notion of. Policies we also have the the notion of validity. Validity. Validity. context rules function like context rules function like context rules function like. Routing table for authorizations for routing table for authorizations for routing table for authorizations for. Every context. they they specify the every context. they they specify the every context. they they specify the. Scope and the conditions that must be scope and the conditions that must be scope and the conditions that must be. Met before the authorization is met before the authorization is met before the authorization is. Granted and yeah we'll see how this granted and yeah we'll see how this granted and yeah we'll see how this. this goes very shortly. So a a smart this goes very shortly. So a a smart this goes very shortly. So a a smart. Account is stores a set of those context account is stores a set of those context. Account is stores a set of those context rules and up to 15 rules per we can rules and up to 15 rules per we can. Rules and up to 15 rules per we can have up to 15 rules per smart account. Have up to 15 rules per smart account. Have up to 15 rules per smart account. We added this limit to ensure there a We added this limit to ensure there a. We added this limit to ensure there a reasonable resource consump consumption reasonable resource consump consumption. Reasonable resource consump consumption and to encourage proactive management. And to encourage proactive management. And to encourage proactive management. For example, to encourage you to remove For example, to encourage you to remove For example, to encourage you to remove. The expired or unused rules. The expired or unused rules. The expired or unused rules. And coming back to this authorization And coming back to this authorization. And coming back to this authorization mechanism or algorithm, actually it's mechanism or algorithm, actually it's. Mechanism or algorithm, actually it's pretty simple. Pretty simple. Pretty simple. when the authorization from a smart when the authorization from a smart when the authorization from a smart. Account is required first we we account is required first we we account is required first we we. Gather and order all non-expired rules gather and order all non-expired rules gather and order all non-expired rules. And then we evaluate them starting from and then we evaluate them starting from and then we evaluate them starting from. The last addit last last addit one the last addit last last addit one the last addit last last addit one. now let's zoom into signers now let's zoom into signers now let's zoom into signers. we have two types of signers we have two types of signers we have two types of signers. Delegated and external delegated and external delegated and external a delegated signer can be any Soroban. A delegated signer can be any Soroban a delegated signer can be any Soroban address, G account or C account. And . Address, G account or C account. And address, G account or C account. And on the right we group all. On the right we group all on the right we group all cryptographic types of schemes or. Cryptographic types of schemes or cryptographic types of schemes or keys in in the external variant. And. Keys in in the external variant. And keys in in the external variant. And we'll see just in a second why we. we'll see just in a second why we we'll see just in a second why we call it external. Call it external. Call it external. But first how the delegated signer But first how the delegated signer But first how the delegated signer. Grants an authorization. Codewise grants an authorization. Codewise grants an authorization. Codewise. It's very simple. we use the built-in it's very simple. we use the built-in. It's very simple. we use the built-in require out for arcs function and require out for arcs function and. Require out for arcs function and however there is a catch I of how however there is a catch I of how. However there is a catch I of how we are actually constructing this we are actually constructing this . We are actually constructing this this transaction this transaction this transaction. I won't go I won't go I won't go I won't dive into this sketch I won't dive into this sketch I. I won't dive into this sketch I it's like you can find more it's like you can find more. It's like you can find more information about it in the information about it in the. Information about it in the documentation and there are some code documentation and there are some code. Documentation and there are some code snippets explaining how to to get snippets explaining how to to get . Snippets explaining how to to get over it. just mentioning it and over it. just mentioning it and. Over it. just mentioning it and that the cap 71 that hopefully gets that the cap 71 that hopefully gets. That the cap 71 that hopefully gets included in some of the future included in some of the future . Included in some of the future protocol updates will resolve these protocol updates will resolve these. Protocol updates will resolve these issues. So yeah very soon I hope issues. So yeah very soon I hope. Issues. So yeah very soon I hope it will be a u no issue. It will be a u no issue. It will be a u no issue. the second signer type is the the second signer type is the the second signer type is the. External one for authorizations coming external one for authorizations coming external one for authorizations coming. From cryptographic keys. From cryptographic keys. From cryptographic keys. But before we look into into that, But before we look into into that, But before we look into into that,. I'm here providing a list of the curves I'm here providing a list of the curves I'm here providing a list of the curves. On Stellar on Stellar on Stellar there the already available ones there the already available ones . there the already available ones that are supported and BN 256 that might that are supported and BN 256 that might. That are supported and BN 256 that might get added with protocol 25. Get added with protocol 25. Get added with protocol 25. and yeah, I guess there there and yeah, I guess there there and yeah, I guess there there. Could be many more in the future. and could be many more in the future. and. Could be many more in the future. and you remember the structure of of the you remember the structure of of the. You remember the structure of of the external serer external serer external serer. like to go back it's a tle of address like to go back it's a tle of address. like to go back it's a tle of address and by and byes and by and byes and by and byes. We could have defined its structure like we could have defined its structure like. We could have defined its structure like this by enumerating all available curves. This by enumerating all available curves this by enumerating all available curves. And the [snorts] bytes that should be and the [snorts] bytes that should be and the [snorts] bytes that should be. Interpreted according to the to the interpreted according to the to the interpreted according to the to the. Curve type. But you you would agree that curve type. But you you would agree that. Curve type. But you you would agree that this approach is not very scalable this approach is not very scalable. This approach is not very scalable because on every new curve that is added because on every new curve that is added. Because on every new curve that is added you have to upgrade your account if you have to upgrade your account if. You have to upgrade your account if it supports it and this is not practical it supports it and this is not practical. It supports it and this is not practical at all. another drawback of embedding. At all. another drawback of embedding at all. another drawback of embedding. Signature verification into the smart signature verification into the smart signature verification into the smart. Account is that it binary size will grow account is that it binary size will grow. Account is that it binary size will grow and the code complexity will increase as. And the code complexity will increase as and the code complexity will increase as. Well. For example, the ED the classical well. For example, the ED the classical well. For example, the ED the classical. ED 25 ED 25 ED 25 119 like it's just one liner but pass 119 like it's just one liner but pass. 119 like it's just one liner but pass key verification for example is pretty key verification for example is pretty. Key verification for example is pretty much is more evolved and requires more much is more evolved and requires more. Much is more evolved and requires more like more code simply like more code simply. like more code simply this pushed us to adopt a way more this pushed us to adopt a way more. This pushed us to adopt a way more flexible and scalable approach that is flexible and scalable approach that is. Flexible and scalable approach that is outsourcing and externalizing all type outsourcing and externalizing all type. Outsourcing and externalizing all type of signature verifications. Of signature verifications. Of signature verifications. So we have a verifier contract So we have a verifier contract So we have a verifier contract. that stands for this address and the that stands for this address and the that stands for this address and the. Public key that is the the bytes. Public key that is the the bytes. Public key that is the the bytes. this verifier contract is a special this verifier contract is a special this verifier contract is a special. One. It is deployed only once per curve one. It is deployed only once per curve one. It is deployed only once per curve. Type or scheme and should be immutable. Type or scheme and should be immutable. Type or scheme and should be immutable. It's it shouldn't keep any state and it's it shouldn't keep any state and it's it shouldn't keep any state and. In such way a single verifier contract in such way a single verifier contract in such way a single verifier contract. Can validate signature signatures for can validate signature signatures for can validate signature signatures for. Any any number of keys. Any any number of keys. Any any number of keys. and yeah this was made possible and yeah this was made possible and yeah this was made possible. Thanks to protocol 23 and that thanks to protocol 23 and that thanks to protocol 23 and that. Made the the cross contract calls made the the cross contract calls made the the cross contract calls . really cheap. really cheap. really cheap. Now let's look into policies. Now let's look into policies. Now let's look into policies. So we have here So we have here So we have here one context rule with the scope, the. one context rule with the scope, the one context rule with the scope, the signers and the policies. Let's say we. Signers and the policies. Let's say we signers and the policies. Let's say we have three signers, two cryptographic. Have three signers, two cryptographic have three signers, two cryptographic keys and one G account. And actually the. Keys and one G account. And actually the keys and one G account. And actually the. Policies policies policies they they modify they customize the they they modify they customize the. they they modify they customize the how signers behave. Here in this case how signers behave. Here in this case. how signers behave. Here in this case we require any two of those three we require any two of those three. We require any two of those three signers to sign to sign so that the signers to sign to sign so that the. Signers to sign to sign so that the authorization authorization authorization passes it's the policies also can modify. Passes it's the policies also can modify passes it's the policies also can modify. Some other aspects of of the flow some other aspects of of the flow some other aspects of of the flow. Here. In this case, we want those here. In this case, we want those here. In this case, we want those . Rule to be enforced only for once per rule to be enforced only for once per rule to be enforced only for once per. Month. month. month. so that like you can for example pay for so that like you can for example pay for. So that like you can for example pay for a subscription. A subscription. A subscription. So policies are external contracts as So policies are external contracts as . So policies are external contracts as like verifiers. Like verifiers. Like verifiers. the verifiers are external. So the verifiers are external. So the verifiers are external. So. Policies are also external contracts. Policies are also external contracts. Policies are also external contracts. Policies can be stateful or stateless Policies can be stateful or stateless Policies can be stateful or stateless. Meaning they can map some state meaning they can map some state meaning they can map some state . For a specific account and context for a specific account and context for a specific account and context. Rule. They can be shared across many rule. They can be shared across many rule. They can be shared across many. Different accounts or can be tied different accounts or can be tied different accounts or can be tied. Just for a specific smart account. Just for a specific smart account. Just for a specific smart account. And the other aspect is that they have a And the other aspect is that they have a. And the other aspect is that they have a four stage life cycle. Four stage life cycle. Four stage life cycle. Which is visible from the interface that which is visible from the interface that. Which is visible from the interface that those policies must adhere to. Those policies must adhere to. Those policies must adhere to. Now if we look into this spending Now if we look into this spending Now if we look into this spending. Limit policy, it is let's say it's a limit policy, it is let's say it's a limit policy, it is let's say it's a. Stateful policy and it is shared across stateful policy and it is shared across stateful policy and it is shared across. Multiple smart accounts. When this multiple smart accounts. When this multiple smart accounts. When this. Policy is added to a context rule, the policy is added to a context rule, the policy is added to a context rule, the. Install hook is called and this in its install hook is called and this in its install hook is called and this in its. The storage for the calling account and the storage for the calling account and the storage for the calling account and. Sets the amount and the time period. For sets the amount and the time period. For. Sets the amount and the time period. For example, here we'll have 100 USDC and example, here we'll have 100 USDC and. Example, here we'll have 100 USDC and one month. This is the in in it one month. This is the in in it . One month. This is the in in it params that are pass can enforce params that are pass can enforce. Params that are pass can enforce is just a read function that is is just a read function that is. is just a read function that is invoked every time the evaluation invoked every time the evaluation. Invoked every time the evaluation loop runs. Loop runs. Loop runs. Enforce on the other hand it requires Enforce on the other hand it requires Enforce on the other hand it requires. Authorization from the already authorization from the already authorization from the already. Installed smart account and modifies can installed smart account and modifies can. Installed smart account and modifies can modify the storage and can emit modify the storage and can emit. Modify the storage and can emit events. Events. Events. Uninstall is called when the is removed. Uninstall is called when the is removed. Uninstall is called when the is removed. So we are cleaning up the policy So we are cleaning up the policy So we are cleaning up the policy. Storage. So install and uninstall are storage. So install and uninstall are storage. So install and uninstall are. Used only once can enforce on every used only once can enforce on every used only once can enforce on every. Evaluation loop and enforce when evaluation loop and enforce when evaluation loop and enforce when . Context rule is matched. Context rule is matched. Context rule is matched. So these are the main elements of smart So these are the main elements of smart So these are the main elements of smart. Account and yeah to sum it up we we account and yeah to sum it up we we account and yeah to sum it up we we. Have we can have up to 15 context rules have we can have up to 15 context rules have we can have up to 15 context rules. Per smart account and each context per smart account and each context per smart account and each context. Through contains signers and policies. Through contains signers and policies. Through contains signers and policies. So let's see some use cases. So let's see some use cases. So let's see some use cases. yeah the most like trivial one yeah the most like trivial one yeah the most like trivial one. Is the multisix threshold bas is the multisix threshold bas is the multisix threshold bas. Based or like the weighted based or like the weighted based or like the weighted . Multics. We can have with this u multics. We can have with this u multics. We can have with this u . Setup we can have time limited app setup we can have time limited app setup we can have time limited app. Sessions. For example you install sessions. For example you install sessions. For example you install. Context rule that is specific for a context rule that is specific for a context rule that is specific for a. Specific app and it's valid just for one specific app and it's valid just for one. Specific app and it's valid just for one day. Day. Day. so you don't so you can interact with so you don't so you can interact with. so you don't so you can interact with this app without needing to approve any this app without needing to approve any. This app without needing to approve any any further transactions. you can add any further transactions. you can add. Any further transactions. you can add for example the keys for AI agent or bot. For example the keys for AI agent or bot for example the keys for AI agent or bot. To as a context rule and allow it to to as a context rule and allow it to to as a context rule and allow it to. Spend some like limited amount of spend some like limited amount of spend some like limited amount of. Your assets so it can trade for example your assets so it can trade for example your assets so it can trade for example. and you don't risk to get wrecked or and you don't risk to get wrecked or and you don't risk to get wrecked or. You can subscribe for some you can subscribe for some you can subscribe for some. Services. So yeah let and here let's see services. So yeah let and here let's see. Services. So yeah let and here let's see how the subscription the flow the user how the subscription the flow the user. How the subscription the flow the user flow for a subscription will happen. So flow for a subscription will happen. So. Flow for a subscription will happen. So I have a smart account and I have the I have a smart account and I have the. I have a smart account and I have the sudo sudo rule like the the super admin sudo sudo rule like the the super admin. Sudo sudo rule like the the super admin rule that is has a single signer rule that is has a single signer. Rule that is has a single signer my pass key and there are no policies my pass key and there are no policies. My pass key and there are no policies and it's valid forever. And it's valid forever. And it's valid forever. Then I I'm going to u some DAP and I Then I I'm going to u some DAP and I Then I I'm going to u some DAP and I. Want to subscribe to a service. The want to subscribe to a service. The want to subscribe to a service. The. DAP prompts me to install a context rule DAP prompts me to install a context rule. DAP prompts me to install a context rule that contains the scope of it is the that contains the scope of it is the. That contains the scope of it is the USD contract because I'm going to pay in USD contract because I'm going to pay in. USD contract because I'm going to pay in USDC. USDC. USDC. The signer is the D pub key. and the The signer is the D pub key. and the The signer is the D pub key. and the.

So the key takeaways this this So the key takeaways this this So the key takeaways this this. Framework is framework is framework is context centric framework. I will context centric framework. I will. context centric framework. I will compare it as the I'm comparing it very compare it as the I'm comparing it very. Compare it as the I'm comparing it very often with the web to login experience. Often with the web to login experience. Often with the web to login experience. For example, when you are logging it For example, when you are logging it For example, when you are logging it . With your Google account or your with your Google account or your with your Google account or your. GitHub account like you authorize the GitHub account like you authorize the. GitHub account like you authorize the third party with some specific third party with some specific. Third party with some specific permissions. We grant some scope permissions. We grant some scope. Permissions. We grant some scope permission. you don't grant the whole permission. you don't grant the whole. Permission. you don't grant the whole access to your data but just to very access to your data but just to very. Access to your data but just to very like scoped permissions. So we are like scoped permissions. So we are. Like scoped permissions. So we are composing authorization intents composing authorization intents. Composing authorization intents through those context rules that contain through those context rules that contain. Through those context rules that contain signers and policies. signers and policies. signers and policies. Another very important aspect is that Another very important aspect is that Another very important aspect is that. Signature verification is not hardcoded signature verification is not hardcoded signature verification is not hardcoded. Into the smart account. So it is this is into the smart account. So it is this is. Into the smart account. So it is this is very flexible and very scalable and very flexible and very scalable and . Very flexible and very scalable and yeah like this framework enables yeah like this framework enables. Yeah like this framework enables programmable authorization in in that programmable authorization in in that. Programmable authorization in in that manner. Manner. Manner.

So, vault tries to standardize all these and it still can be managed. And it still can be managed. And it still can be managed. So, this is what we are trying to do. So, this is what we are trying to do. So, this is what we are trying to do. So, you deposit your assets into the So, you deposit your assets into the So, you deposit your assets into the. World. The world tries to world. The world tries to world. The world tries to utilize your assets in the best way and. Utilize your assets in the best way and utilize your assets in the best way and earn some interest and you will get. Earn some interest and you will get earn some interest and you will get shares in return. And you can always. Shares in return. And you can always shares in return. And you can always do do do. transitions between shares and transitions between shares and transitions between shares and. Assets. You can convert them assets. You can convert them assets. You can convert them. Interchangeably. So how do we calculate shares and So how do we calculate shares and assets? So let's say you deposit your. Assets? So let's say you deposit your assets? So let's say you deposit your assets and you will get shares. The. Assets and you will get shares. The assets and you will get shares. The basic formula for that would be we. Basic formula for that would be we basic formula for that would be we will multiply the deposit assets by the. Will multiply the deposit assets by the will multiply the deposit assets by the total shares currently in the world and. Total shares currently in the world and total shares currently in the world and then we divide the this result by total. Then we divide the this result by total then we divide the this result by total assets in the world and that whole. Assets in the world and that whole assets in the world and that whole result will be your shares. Result will be your shares. Result will be your shares. This will be very important. so now This will be very important. so now This will be very important. so now. That I'm going to do some basic math that I'm going to do some basic math that I'm going to do some basic math . But it's very basic so don't be scared. But it's very basic so don't be scared. But it's very basic so don't be scared. first action first action first action Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the. Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the vault. Vault. Vault. So for deposit assets it's th 100 So for deposit assets it's th 100 So for deposit assets it's th 100. Total shares it's again 100 and total total shares it's again 100 and total total shares it's again 100 and total. Assets is 100. Assets is 100. Assets is 100. So let's say 10% yield is earned So let's say 10% yield is earned So let's say 10% yield is earned. And now the asset amount per share has and now the asset amount per share has and now the asset amount per share has. Increased. So previously one asset increased. So previously one asset increased. So previously one asset. Was corresponding to one share but was corresponding to one share but was corresponding to one share but. Right now right now right now since the total shares have not changed since the total shares have not changed. Since the total shares have not changed it only the interest rate increase the it only the interest rate increase the. It only the interest rate increase the total asset amount total asset amount total asset amount. In the world in the world in the world then this ratio should change right then this ratio should change right . Then this ratio should change right right now if you provide one share you right now if you provide one share you. Right now if you provide one share you will get 1.1 1 asset in return because will get 1.1 1 asset in return because. Will get 1.1 1 asset in return because one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say. One 10% of interest rate and now Bob say Bob deposits 300 USC Bob deposits 300 USC. Bob deposits 300 USC and we do this calculation and Bob will and we do this calculation and Bob will. And we do this calculation and Bob will get will get 272.73 shares in return. So it's not one to one. Shares in return. So it's not one to one mapping as in the case for Alice mapping as in the case for Alice. mapping as in the case for Alice because there was 10%. And this is still because there was 10%. And this is still. Because there was 10%. And this is still fine because if you multiply the fine because if you multiply the. Fine because if you multiply the shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is. Shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is still fair. Still fair. Still fair. And let's say another 10% of interest And let's say another 10% of interest. And let's say another 10% of interest has happened and now Charlie deposits has happened and now Charlie deposits. Has happened and now Charlie deposits 200 and the amount for shares would be 200 and the amount for shares would be. 200 and the amount for shares would be 165. The problem is in this previous slide is The problem is in this previous slide is. We have we have we have these decimals, right? this is not an these decimals, right? this is not an. These decimals, right? this is not an integer but it's kind of a floating integer but it's kind of a floating. Integer but it's kind of a floating number. This is problematic because number. This is problematic because. Number. This is problematic because how do you handle 3.33 shares for how do you handle 3.33 shares for. How do you handle 3.33 shares for example? You cannot. So for shares example? You cannot. So for shares. Example? You cannot. So for shares we round up or down. We round up or down. We round up or down. When we do we round down when do we When we do we round down when do we When we do we round down when do we. Round up. So let's say you are minting round up. So let's say you are minting round up. So let's say you are minting. Or depositing depo depositing we are or depositing depo depositing we are or depositing depo depositing we are. Rounding down your number of shares so rounding down your number of shares so rounding down your number of shares so. That you'll get slightly fewer shares that you'll get slightly fewer shares that you'll get slightly fewer shares. Than the exact ratio. The reason is than the exact ratio. The reason is than the exact ratio. The reason is. World cannot overmint shares and we have world cannot overmint shares and we have. World cannot overmint shares and we have to provide we have to protect the to provide we have to protect the. To provide we have to protect the world not the users so that attacks world not the users so that attacks. World not the users so that attacks won't happen. Won't happen. Won't happen. So this is the same this this So this is the same this this So this is the same this this. Rounding down goes for minting and rounding down goes for minting and rounding down goes for minting and. Depositing and the opposite one rounding depositing and the opposite one rounding. Depositing and the opposite one rounding up goes for redeem and withdraw up goes for redeem and withdraw. Up goes for redeem and withdraw operations for gold operations for gold operations for gold. Which creates another problem which I which creates another problem which I which creates another problem which I. Will demonstrate right now. Let's say will demonstrate right now. Let's say will demonstrate right now. Let's say. okay this is the inflation attack. okay this is the inflation attack. okay this is the inflation attack. There is couple of versions of it. There is couple of versions of it. There is couple of versions of it. let's say the attacker deposits one's let's say the attacker deposits one's. let's say the attacker deposits one's troop. So he minted a share troop. So he minted a share. Troop. So he minted a share and right now one share will correspond and right now one share will correspond. And right now one share will correspond to one's troop only. To one's troop only. To one's troop only. Then the keyword here is donates. It's Then the keyword here is donates. It's Then the keyword here is donates. It's. Not deposit. So since it's not deposit, not deposit. So since it's not deposit, not deposit. So since it's not deposit,. It only increases the total asset amount it only increases the total asset amount. It only increases the total asset amount but not the shares. So it's basically but not the shares. So it's basically. But not the shares. So it's basically I'm just giving away this money to the I'm just giving away this money to the. I'm just giving away this money to the vault and I'm not expecting any shares vault and I'm not expecting any shares. Vault and I'm not expecting any shares in return. Why would someone do this? In return. Why would someone do this? In return. Why would someone do this? You will see the reason. and if you You will see the reason. and if you You will see the reason. and if you. Convert the USDC to stroops you know convert the USDC to stroops you know convert the USDC to stroops you know. There are seven decimal places in there are seven decimal places in there are seven decimal places in. Stellar so we added after 10,000 seven Stellar so we added after 10,000 seven Stellar so we added after 10,000 seven. More u zeros and then we added the more u zeros and then we added the more u zeros and then we added the. Previous ones troop you will have this previous ones troop you will have this previous ones troop you will have this. Number for total assets and now alice number for total assets and now alice number for total assets and now alice. Deposits deposits deposits thousands troops so if you divide thousands troops so if you divide. Thousands troops so if you divide thousands troops to this total asset thousands troops to this total asset. Thousands troops to this total asset amount amount amount you will get something really small like. You will get something really small like you will get something really small like. 0.00001 0.00001 0.00001 or something like that and this will be or something like that and this will be. Or something like that and this will be ultimately zero because of the rounding ultimately zero because of the rounding. Ultimately zero because of the rounding down that I explained previously. So down that I explained previously. So. Down that I explained previously. So basically Alice deposited some money basically Alice deposited some money. Basically Alice deposited some money which which was non zero. It was which which was non zero. It was. Which which was non zero. It was thousands troops but in return she got thousands troops but in return she got. Thousands troops but in return she got zero shares and if the attacker redeems zero shares and if the attacker redeems. Zero shares and if the attacker redeems their shares they will get all the money their shares they will get all the money. Their shares they will get all the money basically stealing Alice's troops. Basically stealing Alice's troops. Basically stealing Alice's troops. The other scenario would be in here. So The other scenario would be in here. So The other scenario would be in here. So. Let's say again this the first two let's say again this the first two let's say again this the first two. Scenario are the same attacker deposited scenario are the same attacker deposited. Scenario are the same attacker deposited one troop and then they donated 1 thou one troop and then they donated 1 thou. One troop and then they donated 1 thou 10,000 USDC 10,000 USDC 10,000 USDC and after that say Alice deposited. And after that say Alice deposited and after that say Alice deposited 10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the. 10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the 10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the total assets right but only one stroop. Total assets right but only one stroop total assets right but only one stroop short of it so if you do the calculation. Short of it so if you do the calculation short of it so if you do the calculation. It will be somewhat like 0.99999 it will be somewhat like 0.99999 it will be somewhat like 0.99999. But since we don't have any precision but since we don't have any precision but since we don't have any precision. For the decimal points, it will again be for the decimal points, it will again be. For the decimal points, it will again be round down to zero and attacker would round down to zero and attacker would. Round down to zero and attacker would steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD. Steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD due to this rounding down behavior. Due to this rounding down behavior. Due to this rounding down behavior. So this is the inflation attack. This is So this is the inflation attack. This is. So this is the inflation attack. This is not only for our implementation. This not only for our implementation. This. Not only for our implementation. This attack existed through all ecosystems attack existed through all ecosystems. Attack existed through all ecosystems and fortunately we have a solution for and fortunately we have a solution for. And fortunately we have a solution for that. The most common one is decimal that. The most common one is decimal. That. The most common one is decimal offset. Offset. Offset. So instead of this regular or the So instead of this regular or the So instead of this regular or the. Straightforward calculation we also add straightforward calculation we also add straightforward calculation we also add. An offset to the power of 10 an offset to the power of 10 an offset to the power of 10. And it will be something like this. So and it will be something like this. So and it will be something like this. So. If you deposit one stroop instead of one if you deposit one stroop instead of one. If you deposit one stroop instead of one share you will get share you will get share you will get. This amount of shares. this is up to this amount of shares. this is up to this amount of shares. this is up to. Your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3 your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3 your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3. 4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will 4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will 4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will. Have nine for the offset and you will have nine for the offset and you will have nine for the offset and you will. Get this amount of shares get this amount of shares get this amount of shares and let's say for the same attack the. And let's say for the same attack the and let's say for the same attack the attacker then donates. Attacker then donates attacker then donates 10,000 USDC 10,000 USDC 10,000 USDC they won't get any shares because. they won't get any shares because they won't get any shares because it's a donation then Alice would deposit. It's a donation then Alice would deposit it's a donation then Alice would deposit. 10,000 strooss it would have been this 10,000 strooss it would have been this 10,000 strooss it would have been this. Small amount previously if we didn't use small amount previously if we didn't use. Small amount previously if we didn't use decimal offset but since we are using decimal offset but since we are using. Decimal offset but since we are using decimal offset Alice will get one share decimal offset Alice will get one share. Decimal offset Alice will get one share and attack won't be and attack won't be and attack won't be. attack won't resolve so basically attack won't resolve so basically attack won't resolve so basically. There is no attack due to this decimal there is no attack due to this decimal there is no attack due to this decimal. Offset and I will just stop presenting and I will just stop presenting and we'll move on to RWA after. And we'll move on to RWA after and we'll move on to RWA after questions. By the way, maybe we can also. Questions. By the way, maybe we can also questions. By the way, maybe we can also. Share a link for the world implement. Share a link for the world implement. Share a link for the world implement.  Yeah, just maybe we also want to  Yeah, just maybe we also want to.  Yeah, just maybe we also want to shout to shout out to shout to shout out to. Shout to shout out to someone who helped contributed to the someone who helped contributed to the. Someone who helped contributed to the implementation. Implementation. Implementation. I don't know if he's on the call, GS I don't know if he's on the call, GS I don't know if he's on the call, GS. Maxi from Sentinel F. So yeah, he he Maxi from Sentinel F. So yeah, he he Maxi from Sentinel F. So yeah, he he. Helped with this implementation. Helped with this implementation. Helped with this implementation. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,  laid the groundwork and we  laid the groundwork and we.  laid the groundwork and we and he also helped us writing the SE and he also helped us writing the SE. and he also helped us writing the SE for world. We just got merged today by for world. We just got merged today by. For world. We just got merged today by the way. so we have a new SE guys for the way. so we have a new SE guys for. The way. so we have a new SE guys for the world. All right, great. Then I can the world. All right, great. Then I can. The world. All right, great. Then I can continue with RWA. So for this one, I'm going to be So for this one, I'm going to be presenting over some text instead of. Presenting over some text instead of presenting over some text instead of slides. Okay. , is the Okay. , is the is it readable or should I make it is it readable or should I make it. Is it readable or should I make it bigger? Bigger? Bigger?  , maybe just slightly bigger. Yeah, I  , maybe just slightly bigger. Yeah, I.  , maybe just slightly bigger. Yeah, I think this is good. Think this is good. Think this is good.  Great.  Great.  Great. So RWA as you know stands for real world So RWA as you know stands for real world. So RWA as you know stands for real world assets and it's more like a switch of assets and it's more like a switch of. Assets and it's more like a switch of contracts contracts contracts compared to a single contract. So it's. Compared to a single contract. So it's compared to a single contract. So it's more complicated and involved for the. More complicated and involved for the more complicated and involved for the base RWA token. You can think of it like. Base RWA token. You can think of it like base RWA token. You can think of it like. A funible token. It has the same a funible token. It has the same a funible token. It has the same. Metadata and core functions but on top metadata and core functions but on top metadata and core functions but on top. Of that we have forced transfer which of that we have forced transfer which. Of that we have forced transfer which the admins can force transfers on behalf. The admins can force transfers on behalf the admins can force transfers on behalf. Of the users. We have freezing both of the users. We have freezing both of the users. We have freezing both. Address level and partial. Partial means address level and partial. Partial means. Address level and partial. Partial means we can freeze some part of your wallet we can freeze some part of your wallet. We can freeze some part of your wallet balance. For example, maybe you have balance. For example, maybe you have. Balance. For example, maybe you have 2,000 in your balance and we only froze 2,000 in your balance and we only froze. 2,000 in your balance and we only froze 500 of it. And address level is your 500 of it. And address level is your. 500 of it. And address level is your address is frozen for every like address is frozen for every like. Address is frozen for every like transfer, mint, etc. operation. So transfer, mint, etc. operation. So. Transfer, mint, etc. operation. So basically you are on hold. Basically you are on hold. Basically you are on hold. We do also provide recovery mechanisms We do also provide recovery mechanisms We do also provide recovery mechanisms. In RWA. In RWA. In RWA. In case of you lose your private key In case of you lose your private key In case of you lose your private key. Then the authorities can recover your then the authorities can recover your then the authorities can recover your. Wallet by wallet by wallet by sending your balance to another wallet sending your balance to another wallet. Sending your balance to another wallet and also all the account related and also all the account related. And also all the account related information of you as well. for this information of you as well. for this. Information of you as well. for this recovery of course you have to convince recovery of course you have to convince. Recovery of course you have to convince the authorities by providing the the authorities by providing the. The authorities by providing the necessary documentation. It's not part necessary documentation. It's not part. Necessary documentation. It's not part of the RWA standard, but this is how it of the RWA standard, but this is how it. Of the RWA standard, but this is how it will work on behi behind the scenes. Will work on behi behind the scenes. Will work on behi behind the scenes. And you probably already know about And you probably already know about And you probably already know about. Pausible operations for pausible operations for pausible operations for the utility for other tokens as well. The utility for other tokens as well. The utility for other tokens as well. This is the same for RWA token. We can This is the same for RWA token. We can This is the same for RWA token. We can. Pause the operations for the contract. Pause the operations for the contract. Pause the operations for the contract. So this base token contract is going to So this base token contract is going to So this base token contract is going to. Be interacting with two modules or be interacting with two modules or be interacting with two modules or. Stacks. One of them is identity, the stacks. One of them is identity, the stacks. One of them is identity, the. Other one is compliance. Other one is compliance. Other one is compliance. Identity stack will be responsible from Identity stack will be responsible from Identity stack will be responsible from. Verifying your identity basically but verifying your identity basically but verifying your identity basically but. It's also very involved and I will get it's also very involved and I will get it's also very involved and I will get. Into details later. And the other one is into details later. And the other one is. Into details later. And the other one is compliance. This is mostly for hooks compliance. This is mostly for hooks. Compliance. This is mostly for hooks post and pre hooks for the post and pre hooks for the. Post and pre hooks for the operations operations operations and this is this exists mostly due to. And this is this exists mostly due to and this is this exists mostly due to allow organizations or governments or. Allow organizations or governments or allow organizations or governments or etc to include or embed their own. Etc to include or embed their own etc to include or embed their own business logic into transfers and means. Business logic into transfers and means business logic into transfers and means and burn operations. And burn operations. And burn operations. So let's go step by step. the RWA So let's go step by step. the RWA So let's go step by step. the RWA. Token as I told you is the main contract token as I told you is the main contract. Token as I told you is the main contract and it and it and it it communicates with compliance and. it communicates with compliance and it communicates with compliance and identity verifier. The compliance is. Identity verifier. The compliance is identity verifier. The compliance is managing five hook types which I will. Managing five hook types which I will managing five hook types which I will dive further deep into. Dive further deep into. Dive further deep into. And the good thing about compliance and And the good thing about compliance and And the good thing about compliance and. Identity verifier is they are identity verifier is they are identity verifier is they are. Multi-token support which means let's multi-token support which means let's multi-token support which means let's. Say you have a compliance contract you say you have a compliance contract you say you have a compliance contract you. Can share this with multiple tokens can share this with multiple tokens can share this with multiple tokens. Multiple RWA tokens. So let's say there multiple RWA tokens. So let's say there multiple RWA tokens. So let's say there. Is another RWA token here. It can also is another RWA token here. It can also is another RWA token here. It can also. Go to the same compliance contract. I go to the same compliance contract. I go to the same compliance contract. I. Will give this example which I like. Will give this example which I like. Will give this example which I like. Let's say you have bank A and bank B in Let's say you have bank A and bank B in Let's say you have bank A and bank B in. Your country and since they are in the your country and since they are in the your country and since they are in the. Same country probably the compliance same country probably the compliance same country probably the compliance. That they need to oblige to will be the that they need to oblige to will be the that they need to oblige to will be the. Same. So they can use the same same. So they can use the same same. So they can use the same. Compliance in this case. Compliance in this case. Compliance in this case. Identity verifier again this can be Identity verifier again this can be Identity verifier again this can be. Shared across multiple tokens. it shared across multiple tokens. it shared across multiple tokens. it. Validates the identity of the validates the identity of the validates the identity of the. Investors of this investors of this investors of this token. token. token. I will dive this into later. So let's I will dive this into later. So let's I will dive this into later. So let's. Skip for now. Skip for now. Skip for now. If you go for the highle basics If you go for the highle basics If you go for the highle basics. for the token you need to provide the for the token you need to provide the. for the token you need to provide the name symbol decimals and initial supply name symbol decimals and initial supply. Name symbol decimals and initial supply very standard basic stuff. Same with the very standard basic stuff. Same with the. Very standard basic stuff. Same with the funible funible funible and on top of the funible we will have. And on top of the funible we will have and on top of the funible we will have the freezing mechanisms. We will have a. The freezing mechanisms. We will have a the freezing mechanisms. We will have a recovery mechanism. We will have force. Recovery mechanism. We will have force recovery mechanism. We will have force transfers and posible operations as I. Transfers and posible operations as I transfers and posible operations as I told you. Told you. Told you. So right now I already told about how So right now I already told about how . So right now I already told about how this compliance and identity stack can this compliance and identity stack can. This compliance and identity stack can be shared. So I'm going to skip this one be shared. So I'm going to skip this one. Be shared. So I'm going to skip this one as well. So let's dive into identity as well. So let's dive into identity. As well. So let's dive into identity stack. Stack. Stack. So there can be multiple ways to verify So there can be multiple ways to verify So there can be multiple ways to verify. Identity. The one we provide which is identity. The one we provide which is identity. The one we provide which is. The default one is claim based. So the default one is claim based. So the default one is claim based. So . You can think of it like I'm from Turkey you can think of it like I'm from Turkey. You can think of it like I'm from Turkey and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this. And I'm a Turkish citizen and in this RWA setting maybe the residency is an RWA setting maybe the residency is an. RWA setting maybe the residency is an issue. So I must have a claim from the issue. So I must have a claim from the. Issue. So I must have a claim from the authorities that I'm a resident authorities that I'm a resident. Authorities that I'm a resident of Turkey. So I need a residency of Turkey. So I need a residency. of Turkey. So I need a residency claim issued for me by the authorities. Claim issued for me by the authorities. Claim issued for me by the authorities. And one downside of this approach can be And one downside of this approach can be. And one downside of this approach can be if it is not encrypted if it is not encrypted. If it is not encrypted then all the data for everyone since then all the data for everyone since. Then all the data for everyone since this is onchain data can be seen by this is onchain data can be seen by. This is onchain data can be seen by everyone. So this is very useful but everyone. So this is very useful but. Everyone. So this is very useful but also if you care about privacy it's it also if you care about privacy it's it. Also if you care about privacy it's it may not be the best solution. May not be the best solution. May not be the best solution. so there are other approaches as well so there are other approaches as well. so there are other approaches as well like you can do Merkel tree, you can like you can do Merkel tree, you can. Like you can do Merkel tree, you can do ZK email, you can do your own custom do ZK email, you can do your own custom. Do ZK email, you can do your own custom approach. We do not provide these by the approach. We do not provide these by the. Approach. We do not provide these by the way but they are for sure doable and we way but they are for sure doable and we. Way but they are for sure doable and we designed the architecture in such a way designed the architecture in such a way. Designed the architecture in such a way that this coupling here is not tight that this coupling here is not tight. That this coupling here is not tight but loose. So you can easily plug plug but loose. So you can easily plug plug. But loose. So you can easily plug plug this one out and plug your own solution this one out and plug your own solution. This one out and plug your own solution for identity stack. Sorry here. So for identity stack. Sorry here. So. For identity stack. Sorry here. So basically you can replace the stack basically you can replace the stack. Basically you can replace the stack here and plug your own. So what do we provide for the default So what do we provide for the default identity? We provide claim topics. These. Identity? We provide claim topics. These identity? We provide claim topics. These. Will be non customer anti-manual will be non customer anti-manual will be non customer anti-manual. Laundering etc. For the topics laundering etc. For the topics laundering etc. For the topics. We limited the topics by at most 15. We we limited the topics by at most 15. We we limited the topics by at most 15. We. Also have trusted issuers. these are also have trusted issuers. these are also have trusted issuers. these are. All separate contracts by the way. Like all separate contracts by the way. Like all separate contracts by the way. Like. This is a separate contract. This is a this is a separate contract. This is a this is a separate contract. This is a. Separate contract. This is a separate separate contract. This is a separate separate contract. This is a separate. Contract. Contract. Contract. And the issuers, the trusted issuers And the issuers, the trusted issuers And the issuers, the trusted issuers. Will be able to sign claims on behalf of will be able to sign claims on behalf of. Will be able to sign claims on behalf of the users so that the users can use the users so that the users can use. The users so that the users can use these claims. These claims. These claims. And And And we also store the information regarding we also store the information regarding. We also store the information regarding the identities like if they are the identities like if they are. The identities like if they are individuals or organization individuals or organization. Individuals or organization which country are they based in etc. which country are they based in etc. which country are they based in etc. So the identity stack is managing all So the identity stack is managing all So the identity stack is managing all. The claims and the the claims and the the claims and the topics and also the topics and also the. Topics and also the account related information like account related information like. Account related information like individual organization country individual organization country. Individual organization country information etc. Information etc. Information etc. The compliance one. So these are the the compliance one. So these are the the compliance one. So these are the. Hooks. This is much more hooks. This is much more hooks. This is much more straightforward. We have two pre hooks. Straightforward. We have two pre hooks straightforward. We have two pre hooks and three post hooks. And three post hooks and three post hooks transferred, created and destroyed. So I. Transferred, created and destroyed. So I transferred, created and destroyed. So I. Will start from the pre hooks. Will start from the pre hooks. Will start from the pre hooks. Say your organization needs to run Say your organization needs to run Say your organization needs to run. Additional business logic for transfers. Additional business logic for transfers. Additional business logic for transfers. So before any transfer operation So before any transfer operation So before any transfer operation. Happens, you want to run some custom happens, you want to run some custom happens, you want to run some custom. Business logic, you can do that. we business logic, you can do that. we business logic, you can do that. we. Have a compliance contract which will have a compliance contract which will have a compliance contract which will. Call this hook when a transfer is about call this hook when a transfer is about call this hook when a transfer is about. To happen. And for this hook to work, to happen. And for this hook to work, to happen. And for this hook to work,. You can have your own contracts. You can have your own contracts. You can have your own contracts. We will call them modules. [snorts] And We will call them modules. [snorts] And We will call them modules. [snorts] And. Let's say you have a module for can let's say you have a module for can let's say you have a module for can. Transfer. So what you would do is you transfer. So what you would do is you transfer. So what you would do is you. Would link the compliance contract to would link the compliance contract to would link the compliance contract to. Your can transfer module contract and your can transfer module contract and your can transfer module contract and. This compliance contract will call your this compliance contract will call your this compliance contract will call your. Module on every time there is a transfer module on every time there is a transfer. Module on every time there is a transfer is about to happen and the good thing is. Is about to happen and the good thing is is about to happen and the good thing is. You can deploy many contracts per one you can deploy many contracts per one you can deploy many contracts per one. Hook. So for example, you can have three hook. So for example, you can have three. Hook. So for example, you can have three contracts that will be called for can contracts that will be called for can. Contracts that will be called for can transfer but five for can create which transfer but five for can create which. Transfer but five for can create which for be minting. This is completely up to for be minting. This is completely up to. For be minting. This is completely up to you. we decided to go with multiple you. we decided to go with multiple. You. we decided to go with multiple contracts due to audit audit contracts due to audit audit. Contracts due to audit audit auditability and also separation of auditability and also separation of. Auditability and also separation of concerns. So if you just wrote your concerns. So if you just wrote your. Concerns. So if you just wrote your logic into this scan transfer and then logic into this scan transfer and then. Logic into this scan transfer and then you wrote another logic in the scan you wrote another logic in the scan. You wrote another logic in the scan transfer by pure code then it would be transfer by pure code then it would be. Transfer by pure code then it would be cumbersome to manage and debug. So cumbersome to manage and debug. So. Cumbersome to manage and debug. So that's why all business logics separated that's why all business logics separated. That's why all business logics separated into their own contracts which will be into their own contracts which will be. Into their own contracts which will be called by a relayer contract or proxy called by a relayer contract or proxy. Called by a relayer contract or proxy contract is a better architecture. Contract is a better architecture. Contract is a better architecture. The same goes for these post hooks. You The same goes for these post hooks. You The same goes for these post hooks. You. Can have additional logic for all of can have additional logic for all of can have additional logic for all of. These. These. These. And that summarizes And that summarizes And that summarizes the compliance module. The compliance module. The compliance module. So what about the access control? you So what about the access control? you. So what about the access control? you have few options. You can go with have few options. You can go with. Have few options. You can go with ownership model or role based access ownership model or role based access. Ownership model or role based access control. So it's completely up to you. Control. So it's completely up to you. Control. So it's completely up to you. And for each kind of operation you can And for each kind of operation you can And for each kind of operation you can. Assign roles have very complex role assign roles have very complex role assign roles have very complex role. Based access control architecture or based access control architecture or based access control architecture or. Very simple one again completely up to very simple one again completely up to very simple one again completely up to. You. You. You. We now only provide one extension for We now only provide one extension for We now only provide one extension for. RWA which is document manager. RWA which is document manager. RWA which is document manager. . [clears throat] enables you to attach [clears throat] enables you to attach [clears throat] enables you to attach. Some legal documents etc to your token. Some legal documents etc to your token. Some legal documents etc to your token. Of course, we do not store the whole Of course, we do not store the whole Of course, we do not store the whole. Document in the blockchain like onchain. Document in the blockchain like onchain. Document in the blockchain like onchain. This will be inefficient. We are This will be inefficient. We are This will be inefficient. We are. Utilizing the hash. Utilizing the hash. Utilizing the hash. And you can also add your own extensions And you can also add your own extensions. And you can also add your own extensions to RWA. To RWA. To RWA. That will be it for the RWA. If you have That will be it for the RWA. If you have. That will be it for the RWA. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Any questions, feel free to ask. Any questions, feel free to ask. I see one question. Is RWA design based I see one question. Is RWA design based I see one question. Is RWA design based. On any existing stars? Yeah, of course. On any existing stars? Yeah, of course. On any existing stars? Yeah, of course. So we work with tokenia and ERC So we work with tokenia and ERC. So we work with tokenia and ERC foundation also in collaboration with foundation also in collaboration with. Foundation also in collaboration with Stellar included. So all these companies Stellar included. So all these companies. Stellar included. So all these companies came together and based on the RWA came together and based on the RWA. Came together and based on the RWA proposal for the Ethereum ecosystem proposal for the Ethereum ecosystem. proposal for the Ethereum ecosystem or general ecosystem we made it specific or general ecosystem we made it specific. Or general ecosystem we made it specific to Stellar. So we made some few to Stellar. So we made some few. To Stellar. So we made some few deviations from the original proposal deviations from the original proposal. Deviations from the original proposal and most of our proposals to deviate and most of our proposals to deviate. And most of our proposals to deviate from it from it from it was welcomed and it will be adopted in. Was welcomed and it will be adopted in was welcomed and it will be adopted in the original standard as well. So we. The original standard as well. So we the original standard as well. So we also contributed to the maturity of the. Also contributed to the maturity of the also contributed to the maturity of the original proposal as well. So it's not. Original proposal as well. So it's not original proposal as well. So it's not designed from scratch if that's what you. Designed from scratch if that's what you designed from scratch if that's what you. Are asking. Are asking. Are asking.  Okay, great. This was three really  Okay, great. This was three really.  Okay, great. This was three really interesting presentations and I think. Interesting presentations and I think interesting presentations and I think. It's very aligned with what we see that it's very aligned with what we see that it's very aligned with what we see that. developers are interested in doing. developers are interested in doing. developers are interested in doing. yeah the the yeah the the yeah the the pass key integration and use that for. Pass key integration and use that for pass key integration and use that for authorization is something that's. Authorization is something that's authorization is something that's very big focus on I think this framework. Very big focus on I think this framework very big focus on I think this framework. You presented is going to help a lot of you presented is going to help a lot of you presented is going to help a lot of. Developers to create a robust developers to create a robust developers to create a robust. Framework for for authorization using framework for for authorization using framework for for authorization using. Pass keys the vault is something pass keys the vault is something pass keys the vault is something. We've seen an increased interest in a we've seen an increased interest in a. We've seen an increased interest in a lot of developers want to build in a way. Lot of developers want to build in a way lot of developers want to build in a way. To earn for the tokens that the the to earn for the tokens that the the to earn for the tokens that the the. Users are are holding in their wallet. Users are are holding in their wallet. Users are are holding in their wallet. So very interesting as well and RWA it's So very interesting as well and RWA it's. So very interesting as well and RWA it's also super aligned with what what SDF is. Also super aligned with what what SDF is also super aligned with what what SDF is. Interested in. So I think this is a interested in. So I think this is a interested in. So I think this is a. Really this really hits right where the really this really hits right where the really this really hits right where the. Focus is from developer sites today. So focus is from developer sites today. So focus is from developer sites today. So. Super interesting and I think we we did super interesting and I think we we did super interesting and I think we we did. Post all of the links but but otherwise post all of the links but but otherwise post all of the links but but otherwise. go to opensein.org go to opensein.org go to opensein.org orc I believe orc I believe. Orc I believe .com and and then then you can you .com and and then then you can you. .com and and then then you can you can also see all the documentation can also see all the documentation. Can also see all the documentation there. let's see was one more there. let's see was one more. There. let's see was one more comment. Yeah, I don't think there's any any Yeah, I don't think there's any any other questions. this is last chance. Other questions. this is last chance other questions. this is last chance if anyone has a question but but thank. If anyone has a question but but thank if anyone has a question but but thank you both of you for for joining today. You both of you for for joining today. You both of you for for joining today. It's super interesting to see all the It's super interesting to see all the It's super interesting to see all the. Work you're doing. And I personally I work you're doing. And I personally I work you're doing. And I personally I. Think it's super interesting to see some think it's super interesting to see some. Think it's super interesting to see some of the some of the libraries you're of the some of the libraries you're. Of the some of the libraries you're building, some of the frameworks and building, some of the frameworks and. Building, some of the frameworks and some of the tooling when we go out to some of the tooling when we go out to. Some of the tooling when we go out to hackathons and when we talk to hackathons and when we talk to. Hackathons and when we talk to developers that we see that they're developers that we see that they're. Developers that we see that they're being used. I think that's that's the being used. I think that's that's the. Being used. I think that's that's the that's the greatest part of it. So So that's the greatest part of it. So So. That's the greatest part of it. So So thank you everyone for joining and thank you everyone for joining and. Thank you everyone for joining and thank you you two guys for being on thank you you two guys for being on. Thank you you two guys for being on here again here again here again  and u I'm sure we will talk again .  and u I'm sure we will talk again  and u I'm sure we will talk again .
