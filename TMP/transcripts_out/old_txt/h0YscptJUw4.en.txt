yeah so there are a few fundamental
yeah so there are a few fundamental
yeah so there are a few fundamental
questions that I guess it would be great
questions that I guess it would be great
questions that I guess it would be great
to get answered so like if the first
to get answered so like if the first
to get answered so like if the first
question is these things that we believe
question is these things that we believe
question is these things that we believe
are like compute for example is it
are like compute for example is it
are like compute for example is it
deterministic enough
deterministic enough
deterministic enough
that we could actually Define a cost for
that we could actually Define a cost for
that we could actually Define a cost for
that that would not vary
yeah yeah I think so that's kind of
yeah yeah I think so that's kind of
the we can the current
the we can the current
the we can the current
idea is to
idea is to
idea is to
yeah to give it a a flat rate basically
yeah to give it a a flat rate basically
yeah to give it a a flat rate basically
like
like
like
the amount of computing you use would be
the amount of computing you use would be
the amount of computing you use would be
a
a
a
linear function right to the I mean the
linear function right to the I mean the
linear function right to the I mean the
sorry the cost for compute would be

sorry the cost for compute would be
linear to the amount of compute you're
linear to the amount of compute you're
linear to the amount of compute you're
using
and then that will tune it over time I
and then that will tune it over time I
think we can over time maybe come up
think we can over time maybe come up
think we can over time maybe come up
with more complicated
with more complicated
with more complicated
models right that the system can
that we can follow but like
that we can follow but like
right now we are using linear functions
right now we are using linear functions
right now we are using linear functions
for that
and yes yeah and the Assumption sorry
and yes yeah and the Assumption sorry
yeah is that
yeah is that
yeah is that
we should be able to on a regular
