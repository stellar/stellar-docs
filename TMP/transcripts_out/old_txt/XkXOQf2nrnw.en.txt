call deposit providers set up auth token
call deposit providers set up auth token
call deposit providers set up auth token
so that

we we use a webview to load the url

basically anything that the anchor needs
basically anything that the anchor needs

since the web a web view is a black box

we can't really tell when the user is

to be able to know when to move on from
to be able to know when to move on from

it so to do that we need to ask the
it so to do that we need to ask the
it so to do that we need to ask the
anchor for all that information
so in order to do this we need to
so in order to do this we need to
use the deposit id that the anchor gave
use the deposit id that the anchor gave
use the deposit id that the anchor gave
us earlier
so so firstly once we have the deposit
so so firstly once we have the deposit
id we save it to our servers
id we save it to our servers
id we save it to our servers
so that to vibrant servers so that if
so that to vibrant servers so that if
so that to vibrant servers so that if
the user closes the app and then
the user closes the app and then
the user closes the app and then
opens it again later we can resume this
opens it again later we can resume this
opens it again later we can resume this
session again

and we use a function in the deposit
and we use a function in the deposit
and we use a function in the deposit
provider called watch all transactions

whenever that transaction changes status

so this is kind of the object that we

get from the anchor
get from the anchor
get from the anchor
and the important field that we're
and the important field that we're

looking for is a status field and that's
looking for is a status field and that's
looking for is a status field and that's
lets us know where where the transaction

usually anchors only create this start
usually anchors only create this start
returning this object after the user

if you close and reopen the app we use
if you close and reopen the app we use
if you close and reopen the app we use
the depos deposit id to resume the
the depos deposit id to resume the

and these this this object also
and these this this object also
and these this this object also
has a more info url
has a more info url
has a more info url
that can can resume the deposit
so what when a user is in the state it's

they they change their mind and they
