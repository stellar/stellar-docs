perform the cryptographic functions
perform the cryptographic functions
perform the cryptographic functions
on it you first have to take that
on it you first have to take that
on it you first have to take that
message and you have to Hash it onto the

curve internally how it works very
curve internally how it works very
curve internally how it works very
briefly is that it there's a h this hash
briefly is that it there's a h this hash
briefly is that it there's a h this hash
function sh 256 and then you also

intricate attack so the basically how
intricate attack so the basically how
intricate attack so the basically how
it works is that it just hashes like
it works is that it just hashes like
it works is that it just hashes like
repeatedly hashes that message into
repeatedly hashes that message into
repeatedly hashes that message into
a certain lens which corresponds to
a certain lens which corresponds to
a certain lens which corresponds to
the the length of the the point on
the the length of the the point on
the the length of the the point on
the curve and then it checks if that
the curve and then it checks if that
the curve and then it checks if that
point is on the Curve and then if not
point is on the Curve and then if not
point is on the Curve and then if not
it it add one and repeat and then
it it add one and repeat and then
it it add one and repeat and then
once it is on the curve then it
once it is on the curve then it
once it is on the curve then it
multiplies by some co-actor to send this
multiplies by some co-actor to send this
multiplies by some co-actor to send this
curve to the correct subgroup
curve to the correct subgroup
curve to the correct subgroup
so this is just getting a little bit
so this is just getting a little bit
so this is just getting a little bit
into more detail is that these curves
into more detail is that these curves
into more detail is that these curves
obviously they are Prime like they

subgroup is the number of points
that we pick or like the the definition
that we pick or like the the definition
that we pick or like the the definition
of the curve pick such that these

operations are defined so the subgroup
operations are defined so the subgroup
operations are defined so the subgroup
is a subset of all available points on

is a subset of all available points on
the BS 81 curve and then the for this
the BS 81 curve and then the for this
the BS 81 curve and then the for this
particular case the subgroup size is 256
particular case the subgroup size is 256
particular case the subgroup size is 256
bit so which is very convenient to be
bit so which is very convenient to be

represented as a big U
represented as a big U
represented as a big U
256 and so yeah some of the host

takes some U 256 vales and then like add
takes some U 256 vales and then like add
takes some U 256 vales and then like add

definition of of this particular curve
definition of of this particular curve
definition of of this particular curve
where the the modulus of the scaler
where the the modulus of the scaler
where the the modulus of the scaler
equals the subgroup size so this is
equals the subgroup size so this is
equals the subgroup size so this is
useful for manipulating the points
useful for manipulating the points
useful for manipulating the points
like multiplying them and then making
like multiplying them and then making
like multiplying them and then making
sure that this scaler is actually like

represented by the points on the curve
represented by the points on the curve
represented by the points on the curve
like yeah
so we just covered hash to curve and
so we just covered hash to curve and
then yeah then we repeat for G2 which
then yeah then we repeat for G2 which
then yeah then we repeat for G2 which

same thing here map to G map map
same thing here map to G map map
same thing here map to G map map
to G2 hash to G2 and then the important
to G2 hash to G2 and then the important

up and send it to a different group
up and send it to a different group
up and send it to a different group
the interesting about the paing is
the interesting about the paing is
the interesting about the paing is
that it is bilinear which means that it

so so here you see pairing of P
so so here you see pairing of P
so so here you see pairing of P
plus s is equal to pairing of P times
plus s is equal to pairing of P times
plus s is equal to pairing of P times
pairing of s and same same here on the
pairing of s and same same here on the
pairing of s and same same here on the
second term Q Plus R you can pair
second term Q Plus R you can pair
second term Q Plus R you can pair
them separately and multiply together so
them separately and multiply together so
them separately and multiply together so
the reason here is a multiplication
the reason here is a multiplication
the reason here is a multiplication
again this is just some details is
again this is just some details is
again this is just some details is
that because the paing result is sent
that because the paing result is sent

to like a higher degree the 12th
to like a higher degree the 12th
to like a higher degree the 12th
degree that's part of the name BR is
degree that's part of the name BR is
degree that's part of the name BR is
12 so we need to get to the 12th
12 so we need to get to the 12th
12 so we need to get to the 12th
degree extension field which is a

multiplications instead of a additive
multiplications instead of a additive
multiplications instead of a additive
Group which is our G1 and G2 so just

some details but important fact is that
some details but important fact is that
some details but important fact is that
you can these relationships can hold
you can these relationships can hold

and then by the extension of it if
and then by the extension of it if
and then by the extension of it if
you have a u on the left side if you
you have a u on the left side if you
you have a u on the left side if you
have a p repeated eight times this
have a p repeated eight times this
have a p repeated eight times this
is essentially multiplying the result

plain par result of p and Q and exponent
plain par result of p and Q and exponent
plain par result of p and Q and exponent
take the exponent a and then you can

quite useful as we see in the example
quite useful as we see in the example
quite useful as we see in the example
of both signature as well as a SN
verification okay so I think that goes
verification okay so I think that goes
over well we just covered the FR which

381 module so the all the functions
381 module so the all the functions
381 module so the all the functions
are exposed inside the BRS 12 381 module
are exposed inside the BRS 12 381 module
are exposed inside the BRS 12 381 module
so the few additional functions like
so the few additional functions like
so the few additional functions like
checking if a if a point is in the
checking if a if a point is in the
checking if a if a point is in the
subgroup but overall there is a
subgroup but overall there is a

pretty much one to one correspondence
pretty much one to one correspondence
pretty much one to one correspondence
between the host function and the SDK
between the host function and the SDK
between the host function and the SDK
function oh and also one interesting

to notice is there's a two addition
to notice is there's a two addition
to notice is there's a two addition
method one is just a plain addition
method one is just a plain addition
method one is just a plain addition
and then the other one is the checked

Edition so so the reason for that is
Edition so so the reason for that is
Edition so so the reason for that is
so remember what I said earlier was
so remember what I said earlier was
so remember what I said earlier was
the BL 12 381 points are defined over a

useful for our pairings and for our
useful for our pairings and for our
useful for our pairings and for our
other like a SN operation like they
other like a SN operation like they
other like a SN operation like they
have to be in the subgroup but the
have to be in the subgroup but the

subgroup check is is is kind of
subgroup check is is is kind of
subgroup check is is is kind of
expensive so if you have a contract
expensive so if you have a contract
expensive so if you have a contract
which does like a number of these
which does like a number of these
which does like a number of these
additions and only you want to make sure
additions and only you want to make sure
additions and only you want to make sure
the end result is on the subgroup then
the end result is on the subgroup then
the end result is on the subgroup then
you can use the plain add function
you can use the plain add function
you can use the plain add function
which is not taking

doing the addition whereas if you wanted
doing the addition whereas if you wanted
doing the addition whereas if you wanted
to be safe and then you wanted to use

to be safe and then you wanted to use
the the checked ad which performs the
the the checked ad which performs the
the the checked ad which performs the
the the subgroup check in in the end
modifcation yeah these are all very
modifcation yeah these are all very
standard yeah repeat for
G2 parent

extension F12 and then to compute that
extension F12 and then to compute that
extension F12 and then to compute that
F12 is very expensive so the parent

perform multiple pairings together
perform multiple pairings together
perform multiple pairings together
and then check that this the end result
and then check that this the end result
and then check that this the end result
equals to one which means this

then oh sorry this is a public key
okay so the the public key is some

then this becomes the the the signature
then this becomes the the the signature
then this becomes the the the signature
so the left and right must hold if this
