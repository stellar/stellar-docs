after unique storage we have what's

archived in recreatable storage you
archived in recreatable storage you
archived in recreatable storage you
don't check the archive and so you just
don't check the archive and so you just
don't check the archive and so you just
create a new entry with the exact same
create a new entry with the exact same
create a new entry with the exact same

and so that's it's a little cheaper

could be multiple versions of it so it's

can be archived and then the final type

so whenever a temporary storage entry

runs out of rent it just gets deleted it

you would want to bump the rent on reads

so that you wouldn't have to constantly

unarchive it the issue is because the
unarchive it the issue is because the
unarchive it the issue is because the
way the bucket list is structured

there's no way to bump rent without

rewriting the entry because
rewriting the entry because

essentially the way the bucket list
essentially the way the bucket list
essentially the way the bucket list
is structured entries and buckets are

immutable and so in order to update an

entry it's not like SQL you can just go
entry it's not like SQL you can just go
to the entry and then change a value you

have to completely rewrite the entry and

so we wouldn't want to bump rent on
