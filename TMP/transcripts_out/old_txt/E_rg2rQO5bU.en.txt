cool so I guess you know for the last
cool so I guess you know for the last
cool so I guess you know for the last
couple of weeks we've been talking about
couple of weeks we've been talking about
couple of weeks we've been talking about
the high level archive interface and
the high level archive interface and
the high level archive interface and
this is kind of the interface where with
this is kind of the interface where with
this is kind of the interface where with
Soroban data types we charge a fee for
Soroban data types we charge a fee for
Soroban data types we charge a fee for
staying live on The Ledger and then if
staying live on The Ledger and then if
staying live on The Ledger and then if
that entry does not pay the fee then
that entry does not pay the fee then
that entry does not pay the fee then
they are sent to this archive where you
they are sent to this archive where you
they are sent to this archive where you
can then restore the entry for some
can then restore the entry for some
can then restore the entry for some
fee and so we've talked about the high
fee and so we've talked about the high
fee and so we've talked about the high
level and so today I'd like to talk a
level and so today I'd like to talk a
level and so today I'd like to talk a
little bit about our implementation
little bit about our implementation
little bit about our implementation
timeline for this project and then go
timeline for this project and then go
timeline for this project and then go
kind of a deep dive into some of the
kind of a deep dive into some of the
kind of a deep dive into some of the
details in the you know first step in
details in the you know first step in
details in the you know first step in
the implementation timeline
the implementation timeline
the implementation timeline
and so first off I think in the last
and so first off I think in the last
and so first off I think in the last
couple weeks we've been calling this the
couple weeks we've been calling this the
couple weeks we've been calling this the
archival system and we are officially

pivoting naming wise to State expiration
pivoting naming wise to State expiration
pivoting naming wise to State expiration
just to remove any confusion with like
just to remove any confusion with like
just to remove any confusion with like
history archives or anything like that
history archives or anything like that
history archives or anything like that
and so I'll be calling it expiration
and so I'll be calling it expiration
and so I'll be calling it expiration
today but it's still the same system
today but it's still the same system
today but it's still the same system
we've been talking about
we've been talking about
we've been talking about
so first I'd like to talk about the
so first I'd like to talk about the
so first I'd like to talk about the
timeline so there's a lot of moving
timeline so there's a lot of moving
timeline so there's a lot of moving
Parts here and there's a lot of

yet and so we are staging this in two
yet and so we are staging this in two
yet and so we are staging this in two
parts we have a part of the project that
parts we have a part of the project that
parts we have a part of the project that
needs to be done when we launch Soroban
needs to be done when we launch Soroban
needs to be done when we launch Soroban
pubnet and then a second part that we
pubnet and then a second part that we
pubnet and then a second part that we
can kind of finish later on after launch
can kind of finish later on after launch
can kind of finish later on after launch
and so at launch there are two big
and so at launch there are two big
and so at launch there are two big
components that we want to have
components that we want to have
components that we want to have
ready and done now the first is we want
ready and done now the first is we want
ready and done now the first is we want
to implement the rent system and
to implement the rent system and
to implement the rent system and
temporary storage completely which means
temporary storage completely which means
temporary storage completely which means
that from day one sarban entries will
that from day one sarban entries will
that from day one sarban entries will
need to pay rent and also will have rent
need to pay rent and also will have rent
need to pay rent and also will have rent
charged from them and then secondly we
charged from them and then secondly we
charged from them and then secondly we
want to have the unique storage and
want to have the unique storage and
want to have the unique storage and
recreable storage interface finalized
recreable storage interface finalized
recreable storage interface finalized
and exposed in the Soroban SDK
and exposed in the Soroban SDK
and exposed in the Soroban SDK
but we won't actually turn on on state
but we won't actually turn on on state
but we won't actually turn on on state
expiration yet so what this means is on
expiration yet so what this means is on

day one you can expect to have all the
day one you can expect to have all the

storage and they won't actually need to
storage and they won't actually need to
storage and they won't actually need to
be restored kind of our thinking with
be restored kind of our thinking with
be restored kind of our thinking with
this is that actually implementing the
this is that actually implementing the
this is that actually implementing the
storage backend is a very significant
storage backend is a very significant
storage backend is a very significant
problem that will take some time but as
problem that will take some time but as
problem that will take some time but as
long as the interface is set and
long as the interface is set and
long as the interface is set and
finalized at launch even though we
finalized at launch even though we
finalized at launch even though we
haven't turned on state expiration yet
haven't turned on state expiration yet
haven't turned on state expiration yet
any smart contracts are deployed on day
any smart contracts are deployed on day
any smart contracts are deployed on day
one we'll have the proper interface and
one we'll have the proper interface and
one we'll have the proper interface and
the proper tools to deal with State
the proper tools to deal with State

expiration when we do eventually turn it
expiration when we do eventually turn it
expiration when we do eventually turn it
on later

and so kind of with that in mind I'd
and so kind of with that in mind I'd
and so kind of with that in mind I'd
like to talk about today some of the
like to talk about today some of the
like to talk about today some of the
details between the rent implementation
details between the rent implementation
details between the rent implementation
and the temporary storage implementation
and the temporary storage implementation
and the temporary storage implementation
that's kind of the first step
that's kind of the first step
that's kind of the first step
implementation wise and getting State
implementation wise and getting State
implementation wise and getting State
expiration into sorobot
expiration into sorobot
expiration into sorobot
and so first I'd like to talk a little
and so first I'd like to talk a little
and so first I'd like to talk a little
bit about rent and some of the opening
bit about rent and some of the opening
bit about rent and some of the opening
questions we've had there in some of our
questions we've had there in some of our

so we've discussed rent briefly

before where essentially every sorbonne

and then periodically over time the rent

list for a given Ledger

so the rent fee is variable based on the

size of the bucket list kind of in a

similar way as to the bucket list write

fee in the fee cap the thinking here

being that we want the rent fee to
being that we want the rent fee to
being that we want the rent fee to
increase as the size of the bucket list
increase as the size of the bucket list
increase as the size of the bucket list
increases the reasoning for this is that
increases the reasoning for this is that
increases the reasoning for this is that
as The Bucket List gets larger the fee
as The Bucket List gets larger the fee
as The Bucket List gets larger the fee
for adding the bucket list also
for adding the bucket list also
for adding the bucket list also
increases and so we don't want this fee
increases and so we don't want this fee
increases and so we don't want this fee
to grow exponentially or grow
to grow exponentially or grow
to grow exponentially or grow
unboundedly so by also having the
unboundedly so by also having the
unboundedly so by also having the
archive or the rent fee increase at the
archive or the rent fee increase at the
archive or the rent fee increase at the
same rate what you can have is this
same rate what you can have is this
same rate what you can have is this
equilibrium where as it gets more
equilibrium where as it gets more

expensive to add to the bucket list and
expensive to add to the bucket list and
expensive to add to the bucket list and
as The Bucket List gets bigger the fee
as The Bucket List gets bigger the fee
as The Bucket List gets bigger the fee
increases so it's more likely that more
increases so it's more likely that more
increases so it's more likely that more
entries will be removed and deleted from
entries will be removed and deleted from
entries will be removed and deleted from
The Bucket List as they run out of rent
The Bucket List as they run out of rent
The Bucket List as they run out of rent
and as they expire and so we kind of
and as they expire and so we kind of
and as they expire and so we kind of
have this equilibrium system set up with
have this equilibrium system set up with
have this equilibrium system set up with
this variable fee rate
this variable fee rate
this variable fee rate
now in addition to the variable fee rate
now in addition to the variable fee rate
now in addition to the variable fee rate
I think one of the questions that we
I think one of the questions that we
I think one of the questions that we
haven't really addressed yet is how we
haven't really addressed yet is how we
haven't really addressed yet is how we
actually pay for the rent on these
actually pay for the rent on these
actually pay for the rent on these
entries and so initially we wanted this
entries and so initially we wanted this
entries and so initially we wanted this
process to be as seamless as possible
process to be as seamless as possible
process to be as seamless as possible
and so we wanted a way to automatically
and so we wanted a way to automatically

bump rent whenever you access items
bump rent whenever you access items
bump rent whenever you access items
other thinking being that the developers

shouldn't have to worry about

have a small rent bump so it's always

behavior for paying rent primarily
because different types of contracts
because different types of contracts
because different types of contracts
might have to pay rent differently and
might have to pay rent differently and
might have to pay rent differently and
so I think the big question here is
so I think the big question here is
so I think the big question here is
who is responsible for paying rent is it
who is responsible for paying rent is it
who is responsible for paying rent is it
the user who's invoking the contract
the user who's invoking the contract
the user who's invoking the contract
that's responsible or is it the contract

maintainer itself who's responsible for

and kind of in our case studies we
and kind of in our case studies we
and kind of in our case studies we
determined that there are two separate

determined that there are two separate
use cases that kind of illustrate this
use cases that kind of illustrate this
use cases that kind of illustrate this
example well so one example is you have
example well so one example is you have

a token contract such as usdc where you
a token contract such as usdc where you
a token contract such as usdc where you
have users that have an individual token

have users that have an individual token
balance that they kind of own so even

though a circle or some third party
though a circle or some third party
though a circle or some third party
would be maintained this contract the
would be maintained this contract the
would be maintained this contract the
token balances are tied to users and so
token balances are tied to users and so
token balances are tied to users and so
it seems to make the most sense that the
it seems to make the most sense that the
it seems to make the most sense that the
user would have to pay to maintain that
user would have to pay to maintain that
user would have to pay to maintain that
token balance and so in the token
token balance and so in the token
token balance and so in the token
contract example you would want the
contract example you would want the
contract example you would want the
invoker of the contract to have to pay
invoker of the contract to have to pay
invoker of the contract to have to pay

however in the other example you have
however in the other example you have
however in the other example you have
something like an amm and say that we
something like an amm and say that we
something like an amm and say that we
have an amm that has a liquid equal or
have an amm that has a liquid equal or

an asset pair now if you want to access
an asset pair now if you want to access
an asset pair now if you want to access
this asset pair this is kind of a public
this asset pair this is kind of a public
this asset pair this is kind of a public
shared resource of the amm itself and so
shared resource of the amm itself and so
shared resource of the amm itself and so
it doesn't make sense for the individual
it doesn't make sense for the individual
it doesn't make sense for the individual
user who's accessing the access pair to
user who's accessing the access pair to
user who's accessing the access pair to
have to pay for the rent even if that

have to pay for the rent even if that
entry would be used by many different
entry would be used by many different
entry would be used by many different
users of the amm and so we kind of have
users of the amm and so we kind of have
users of the amm and so we kind of have
these two separate cases where in the
these two separate cases where in the
these two separate cases where in the
token contract you have this kind of
token contract you have this kind of
token contract you have this kind of
individual owned entry by one user where

in the amm case you have like the shared
in the amm case you have like the shared
in the amm case you have like the shared

could fit the rent payment into that

and so there didn't seem to be a clear
and so there didn't seem to be a clear

way to default bump rent because there's
way to default bump rent because there's
way to default bump rent because there's
no good default Behavior as to who pays

contract developers can use to define
contract developers can use to define
contract developers can use to define
how retinas paid for their entries

and so what these two Primitives are are
and so what these two Primitives are are
and so what these two Primitives are are
we're calling them rent bump and then
we're calling them rent bump and then
we're calling them rent bump and then
rent bump from and these are modeled

after the token transfer contract and so

kind of in the in the native asset
kind of in the in the native asset
kind of in the in the native asset
contract you have two functions which

so essentially the rent bump and the
so essentially the rent bump and the
so essentially the rent bump and the
rent bump from functions work in a
rent bump from functions work in a
rent bump from functions work in a
similar way insofar as you can Define
similar way insofar as you can Define

who the from address is from so who
who the from address is from so who
who the from address is from so who
is paying for the rent and then also
is paying for the rent and then also
is paying for the rent and then also
with rent bump from you can also pay
with rent bump from you can also pay
with rent bump from you can also pay
out of an allowance so this allows smart
out of an allowance so this allows smart
out of an allowance so this allows smart
contracts to do is to find who can pay
contracts to do is to find who can pay
contracts to do is to find who can pay
so for instance in the amm example it
so for instance in the amm example it
so for instance in the amm example it
might make sense that for every

transaction in the amm a small fee is

collected and put into a central shared
collected and put into a central shared
collected and put into a central shared

entries in this way the cost of keeping

amortized among the entire user base and

so you don't have one particular user

that gets unlucky and has to pay to bump

instead you have this centralized pool

instead you have this centralized pool
that the contract can pay from

itself would have to bump rent but we

want to give flexibility and so it might

make sense for certain implementations

make sense for certain implementations
to still want to have a user pay for

usability purposes the contract would
usability purposes the contract would
usability purposes the contract would
want to pay on the user's behalf and so
want to pay on the user's behalf and so

using this interface because it's
using this interface because it's
using this interface because it's
similar to the Token interface
similar to the Token interface
similar to the Token interface
allowances can also be used for paying
allowances can also be used for paying

probably do is
probably do is
say Okay I want to bump this by a

say Okay I want to bump this by a
thousand measures or 10 000 ledgers or
thousand measures or 10 000 ledgers or
thousand measures or 10 000 ledgers or
whatever and what we would do is take
whatever and what we would do is take
whatever and what we would do is take
the current bucket list price do an
the current bucket list price do an
the current bucket list price do an
estimation

and then I think what we could also do
and then I think what we could also do
and then I think what we could also do
is maybe add an optional parameter to
is maybe add an optional parameter to
is maybe add an optional parameter to
the rent bump that says I want this much
the rent bump that says I want this much
the rent bump that says I want this much
wiggle room
wiggle room
wiggle room
so say like I want like 10 000
so say like I want like 10 000
so say like I want like 10 000
ledgers worth of you know rent
ledgers worth of you know rent
ledgers worth of you know rent
and then put another 200 xlm in there
and then put another 200 xlm in there
and then put another 200 xlm in there
just in case and so I think this works
just in case and so I think this works
just in case and so I think this works
pretty well and I think that
pretty well and I think that
pretty well and I think that
you know even though the rate is
you know even though the rate is
you know even though the rate is
variable I don't think it will the

growth is bounded and also I don't
growth is bounded and also I don't
growth is bounded and also I don't
expect the growth I don't expect it to
expect the growth I don't expect it to
expect the growth I don't expect it to
grow or change quickly and so I think
grow or change quickly and so I think
grow or change quickly and so I think
if it's an entry that's being
if it's an entry that's being
if it's an entry that's being
accessed often
accessed often

and you're doing like this if check
and you're doing like this if check

on every access which is kind of the
on every access which is kind of the

the recommended design Paradigm at this

time then as long as that entry is being

often used it doesn't really matter if

say your five or six ledgers behind
say your five or six ledgers behind
say your five or six ledgers behind
where you thought you were going to be
where you thought you were going to be
where you thought you were going to be
you can still do that check and if
you can still do that check and if
you can still do that check and if
it's the frequently used entry catch it
it's the frequently used entry catch it
it's the frequently used entry catch it
in time and then bump the run again and
in time and then bump the run again and
in time and then bump the run again and
so I think that's kind of makes the most
so I think that's kind of makes the most
so I think that's kind of makes the most
sense is that for temporary entries they
