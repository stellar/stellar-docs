with GCP as well.
So same for GCP you have all the
So same for GCP you have all the
information to provide
information to provide

 okay no I have a strange sound in my

ear anyway so depending on the
ear anyway so depending on the

different information you have to
different information you have to
different information you have to
provide so Google cloud storage is
provide so Google cloud storage is
provide so Google cloud storage is
different information. So of course the
different information. So of course the
different information. So of course the
best is to refer to create the bucket
best is to refer to create the bucket
best is to refer to create the bucket
for instance to get the information or

So once you indeed provide your
