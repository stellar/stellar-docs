smart contract was and the the concept
smart contract was and the the concept
smart contract was and the the concept
of it but I did not know any subtlety

Know I at first I really started with
Know I at first I really started with
Know I at first I really started with
some I did not have like a a concrete
some I did not have like a a concrete
some I did not have like a a concrete
idea I wanted. I had some some toy
idea I wanted. I had some some toy
idea I wanted. I had some some toy
problem that I had in my in my head that
problem that I had in my in my head that
problem that I had in my in my head that
I wanted to to do. maybe some people
I wanted to to do. maybe some people
I wanted to to do. maybe some people
in the audience also saw saw some some
in the audience also saw saw some some
in the audience also saw saw some some
of these. I had an idea with a I had a
of these. I had an idea with a I had a
of these. I had an idea with a I had a
Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build
Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build
Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build
like a gimmified platform where you
like a gimmified platform where you
like a gimmified platform where you
actually you have a a pump and you use
actually you have a a pump and you use
actually you have a a pump and you use
the you pump and as much as you pump if
the you pump and as much as you pump if
the you pump and as much as you pump if
you pass a threshold and it's going to
you pass a threshold and it's going to
you pass a threshold and it's going to
to do a trigger and and to send some
to do a trigger and and to send some
to do a trigger and and to send some
tokens. So I had something like that
tokens. So I had something like that
tokens. So I had something like that
that I hacked away. That was my first
that I hacked away. That was my first
that I hacked away. That was my first
contract actually and yeah that's
contract actually and yeah that's
contract actually and yeah that's
that's what I built first and I even
that's what I built first and I even
that's what I built first and I even
made a YouTube video about it. and so
made a YouTube video about it. and so
made a YouTube video about it. and so
yeah, I did one idea like that and and
yeah, I did one idea like that and and
yeah, I did one idea like that and and
the second one that I did was I wanted
the second one that I did was I wanted
the second one that I did was I wanted
to explore around the tokenization of
to explore around the tokenization of
to explore around the tokenization of
things and make a make a a token and but
things and make a make a a token and but
things and make a make a a token and but
push a bit further. And so there I was
push a bit further. And so there I was
push a bit further. And so there I was
okay I had this idea of looking at
okay I had this idea of looking at
okay I had this idea of looking at
live data so weather data and so I was
live data so weather data and so I was
live data so weather data and so I was
looking at the the expansion of the ice
looking at the the expansion of the ice
looking at the the expansion of the ice
and the contraction of the ice in the
and the contraction of the ice in the
and the contraction of the ice in the
Arctic. And I was like, okay, I'm going
Arctic. And I was like, okay, I'm going
Arctic. And I was like, okay, I'm going
to put that data and use that data to
to put that data and use that data to
to put that data and use that data to
either mint or burn a token. And so I
either mint or burn a token. And so I
either mint or burn a token. And so I
had sort of an oracle in mind. And so
had sort of an oracle in mind. And so
had sort of an oracle in mind. And so
I built another project like that. And
I built another project like that. And
I built another project like that. And
building these two project gave me
building these two project gave me
building these two project gave me
some confidence into building smart
some confidence into building smart
some confidence into building smart

you enjoy to do and where you can get
you enjoy to do and where you can get
you enjoy to do and where you can get
some user interactions and and see
some user interactions and and see
some user interactions and and see
people enjoy it. So I think that's a
people enjoy it. So I think that's a

time you do something yeah you would see
time you do something yeah you would see
it see it here and here are all the
it see it here and here are all the
it see it here and here are all the
entries and so how is the project
entries and so how is the project
entries and so how is the project
defined let me try to find it so yeah
defined let me try to find it so yeah
defined let me try to find it so yeah
here here's the the project defined so
here here's the the project defined so
here here's the the project defined so
here is saliv but had tonsu yeah here's
here is saliv but had tonsu yeah here's
here is saliv but had tonsu yeah here's
the project how it's defined so that's
the project how it's defined so that's
the project how it's defined so that's
that's basically the information store
that's basically the information store
that's basically the information store
on chain I saw the project name some
on chain I saw the project name some
on chain I saw the project name some
config itself so who are the
config itself so who are the
config itself so who are the
maintainer of the project so who has
maintainer of the project so who has
maintainer of the project so who has
really access on
really access on
really access on
it. and and after that I have some
it. and and after that I have some
it. and and after that I have some
some other metadata associated to that
some other metadata associated to that
some other metadata associated to that
and the the main metadata right now is
and the the main metadata right now is
and the the main metadata right now is
the the last state of the project on
the the last state of the project on
the the last state of the project on
GitHub which is a commit hash. So this
GitHub which is a commit hash. So this
GitHub which is a commit hash. So this
is this store in in another entry. So
is this store in in another entry. So
is this store in in another entry. So
yeah this seems yeah exactly this
yeah this seems yeah exactly this
yeah this seems yeah exactly this
that key for tensu here is the same
that key for tensu here is the same
that key for tensu here is the same
as here last hash and that's the last
as here last hash and that's the last
as here last hash and that's the last
hash which is register right now which
hash which is register right now which
hash which is register right now which
correspond to a commit which exist and
correspond to a commit which exist and
correspond to a commit which exist and
so if I go back when there is
so if I go back when there is
so if I go back when there is
actually a match with unshaded data
actually a match with unshaded data
actually a match with unshaded data
and the data that you find on GitHub
and the data that you find on GitHub
and the data that you find on GitHub
it's indicating you that everything is

so if somebody would compromise GitHub
so if somebody would compromise GitHub
so if somebody would compromise GitHub
basically and overwrite the commits on
basically and overwrite the commits on
basically and overwrite the commits on
GitHub. This will get read and I in the
GitHub. This will get read and I in the
GitHub. This will get read and I in the
future I will add some triggers which
future I will add some triggers which

will send some notification to people to
will send some notification to people to

say that hey something happened on
GitHub versus what's on chain. So that's
GitHub versus what's on chain. So that's
GitHub versus what's on chain. So that's
one of the main security feature that I
one of the main security feature that I
one of the main security feature that I
have right now and the same goes with
have right now and the same goes with
have right now and the same goes with
the configuration to say who's
the configuration to say who's
the configuration to say who's
maintainer who's not maintainer. So this
maintainer who's not maintainer. So this
maintainer who's not maintainer. So this
is check against the this tomal this
is check against the this tomal this
is check against the this tomal this
this tensu tomal file that is I'm
this tensu tomal file that is I'm
this tensu tomal file that is I'm
comparing the data which is in this file
comparing the data which is in this file
comparing the data which is in this file
with the data that have function to to
with the data that have function to to

to have this this sort of check. so
to have this this sort of check. so
to have this this sort of check. so
yeah here you have the the commit
yeah here you have the the commit
yeah here you have the the commit

we just saw this F72 which was on which
we just saw this F72 which was on which

is verified and because I defined some
is verified and because I defined some

maintainer this is the last one that
I've done to and here I'm a verified
I've done to and here I'm a verified
I've done to and here I'm a verified
maintainer in this list. So you have
maintainer in this list. So you have
maintainer in this list. So you have
some indication here of what's on chain
some indication here of what's on chain
some indication here of what's on chain
and and to be able to verify that. So
and and to be able to verify that. So
and and to be able to verify that. So
that's the first part, the security part
that's the first part, the security part
that's the first part, the security part
and the most important part for me is
and the most important part for me is

really this governance part. And so
really this governance part. And so
really this governance part. And so
if I go on the governance, that's really
if I go on the governance, that's really
if I go on the governance, that's really
your your DAO. You have not the Dow for

the on the on the proposals
the on the on the proposals
the on the on the proposals
themselves. So let me just open a

this data as I just shown before is
this data as I just shown before is
this data as I just shown before is

concept I have with the the DA proposal
concept I have with the the DA proposal
concept I have with the the DA proposal
is that I have the concept of outcome.

is that I have the concept of outcome.
And so when a proposal is accepted it
And so when a proposal is accepted it
And so when a proposal is accepted it
can execute when when you're going to
can execute when when you're going to
can execute when when you're going to
execute the proposal itself and to to
execute the proposal itself and to to
execute the proposal itself and to to
have the the tally being calculated
have the the tally being calculated
have the the tally being calculated
you're actually going to be able to say
you're actually going to be able to say
you're actually going to be able to say
okay if it's approved please execute
okay if it's approved please execute
okay if it's approved please execute
that transaction and so here you have
that transaction and so here you have
that transaction and so here you have
an example of of ex that I put so here
an example of of ex that I put so here
an example of of ex that I put so here
in this it's a trivial example that I
in this it's a trivial example that I
in this it's a trivial example that I
put here but you can put any any when
put here but you can put any any when
put here but you can put any any when
you create a proposal and so if the when
you create a proposal and so if the when
you create a proposal and so if the when
you execute a proposal You're going to
you execute a proposal You're going to
you execute a proposal You're going to
have like a screen telling you this is
have like a screen telling you this is
have like a screen telling you this is
going to be executed when you actually
going to be executed when you actually
going to be executed when you actually
execute the proposal. And so the the
execute the proposal. And so the the
execute the proposal. And so the the
ting is going to be made and this is
ting is going to be made and this is
ting is going to be made and this is
going to be also also sent. So what what
going to be also also sent. So what what
going to be also also sent. So what what
can you use that for? You can use this
can you use that for? You can use this
can you use that for? You can use this
for instance to add a m not just to pay
for instance to add a m not just to pay
for instance to add a m not just to pay
people but to me it was to do some
people but to me it was to do some
people but to me it was to do some
special action for maintainers. For

instance, if you wanted to change the
instance, if you wanted to change the
instance, if you wanted to change the
structure of your governance, you can
structure of your governance, you can
structure of your governance, you can
say you can have a proposal saying, "Oh,
say you can have a proposal saying, "Oh,

And so you will make a proposal and the
And so you will make a proposal and the
And so you will make a proposal and the
the XDR itself would just be to call
the XDR itself would just be to call
the XDR itself would just be to call
the tanu contract itself and to add
the tanu contract itself and to add
the tanu contract itself and to add
myself to another project and people
myself to another project and people
myself to another project and people
when they vote and when you execute that
when they vote and when you execute that
when they vote and when you execute that
then I would be able to be added
then I would be able to be added
then I would be able to be added
automatically into the into that new
automatically into the into that new

also you can yeah have font
also you can yeah have font
also you can yeah have font
distributions and all of that. And what
distributions and all of that. And what
distributions and all of that. And what
I want to to do afterwards is so right
I want to to do afterwards is so right
I want to to do afterwards is so right
now it's very manual. You have to
now it's very manual. You have to
now it's very manual. You have to
create your own XDR and paste it there.
create your own XDR and paste it there.
create your own XDR and paste it there.
But what I want to have is templates
But what I want to have is templates
But what I want to have is templates
that people can use and they will be

have a few fields to fill and boom it
have a few fields to fill and boom it
have a few fields to fill and boom it
will just pre build the easier for you.
