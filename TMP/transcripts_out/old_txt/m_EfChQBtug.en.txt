if you have like money
if you have like money
if you have like money
or any asset locked into a contract it's
or any asset locked into a contract it's
or any asset locked into a contract it's
going to be
recovered basically
recovered basically
when you your authorization gets
when you your authorization gets
when you your authorization gets

well that's actually not
well that's actually not

basically
basically
basically
there's no way to to enforce anything
there's no way to to enforce anything

there so so then the question is like
there so so then the question is like

well
well
well
what do we do because if you don't do
what do we do because if you don't do
what do we do because if you don't do
anything
anything
anything
in both proposals
in both proposals
in both proposals
we're basically saying well you know if
we're basically saying well you know if
we're basically saying well you know if
you want to get around any kind of
you want to get around any kind of
you want to get around any kind of
restrictions just you know send your
restrictions just you know send your

and then
and then
and then
it's like this super mixer or something
it's like this super mixer or something
it's like this super mixer or something
and then like you can
and then like you can
and then like you can
you can't reasonably have enforcement
you can't reasonably have enforcement
you can't reasonably have enforcement



so maybe we can start with that like we
