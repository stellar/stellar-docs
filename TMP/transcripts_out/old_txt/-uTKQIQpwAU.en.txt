Stellar test net or mainet. So I'm going
Stellar test net or mainet. So I'm going

to click test net right now. And from
to click test net right now. And from
to click test net right now. And from
here we just go ahead and paste in a
here we just go ahead and paste in a
here we just go ahead and paste in a
contract ID. it does work with both

WASM and Stellar asset contracts. The
WASM and Stellar asset contracts. The
WASM and Stellar asset contracts. The
main difference is that these will pull
main difference is that these will pull
main difference is that these will pull
directly from source, but these since

pull in a whole bunch of stuff. First,
pull in a whole bunch of stuff. First,
pull in a whole bunch of stuff. First,
we pull in the contract state here. So,
we pull in the contract state here. So,
we pull in the contract state here. So,
this is the current state of the
this is the current state of the
this is the current state of the

Really cool. And so, from here, we can
Really cool. And so, from here, we can
Really cool. And so, from here, we can
go ahead and click next. And this is
go ahead and click next. And this is
go ahead and click next. And this is
where we start to decide or build out
where we start to decide or build out
where we start to decide or build out
our form. And the first thing you'll
our form. And the first thing you'll
our form. And the first thing you'll
want to do is select a function. what
want to do is select a function. what
want to do is select a function. what
do you want to build a form for? What
do you want to build a form for? What
do you want to build a form for? What
piece do you want to interact with? And
piece do you want to interact with? And
piece do you want to interact with? And
there's a whole bunch of different
there's a whole bunch of different
there's a whole bunch of different
stuff. I'm going to select something
stuff. I'm going to select something
stuff. I'm going to select something
pretty simple, just a set text right
pretty simple, just a set text right
pretty simple, just a set text right
here. So I just hit select here. And
here. So I just hit select here. And
here. So I just hit select here. And
from here I can start to kind of
from here I can start to kind of
from here I can start to kind of
customize this. So I can say like set
customize this. So I can say like set
customize this. So I can say like set
greeting. I can change the description,
greeting. I can change the description,
greeting. I can change the description,
things like that. , from there I can
things like that. , from there I can
things like that. , from there I can
go into the fields and have like field
go into the fields and have like field
go into the fields and have like field
labels. I could do field types and you
labels. I could do field types and you
labels. I could do field types and you
know if we need an email or input,
know if we need an email or input,
know if we need an email or input,
there's like a whole bunch of different
there's like a whole bunch of different
there's like a whole bunch of different
types here. So I'm going to say we'll
types here. So I'm going to say we'll
types here. So I'm going to say we'll
just call this greeting
just call this greeting
just call this greeting
and say placeholder hello. And there's a
and say placeholder hello. And there's a
and say placeholder hello. And there's a
whole lot of stuff you can do like
whole lot of stuff you can do like
whole lot of stuff you can do like
required fields. You can hide from the
required fields. You can hide from the
required fields. You can hide from the
UI, use hard-coded values. It's very
UI, use hard-coded values. It's very
UI, use hard-coded values. It's very
customizable. And so once we have that,
customizable. And so once we have that,
customizable. And so once we have that,
I'll go ahead and do an execution
I'll go ahead and do an execution
I'll go ahead and do an execution
method. So from here we can decide if we
method. So from here we can decide if we
method. So from here we can decide if we
want to allow any wallet to connect with
want to allow any wallet to connect with
want to allow any wallet to connect with
this and start using it or if we want to
this and start using it or if we want to
this and start using it or if we want to
require like specific account to
require like specific account to
require like specific account to
interact with it. We also have the
interact with it. We also have the
interact with it. We also have the
option to do OpenZeppelin relayers. If
option to do OpenZeppelin relayers. If
option to do OpenZeppelin relayers. If
you haven't checked out relayers, I
you haven't checked out relayers, I
you haven't checked out relayers, I
would highly recommend you do. You can
would highly recommend you do. You can
would highly recommend you do. You can
check them out at
check them out at

And essentially they're managed services
And essentially they're managed services
And essentially they're managed services
kind of like a back-end server that can
kind of like a back-end server that can
kind of like a back-end server that can
relay transactions for you and can
relay transactions for you and can
relay transactions for you and can
automate certain things and you can do
automate certain things and you can do
automate certain things and you can do
things like gasless transactions. It has
things like gasless transactions. It has
things like gasless transactions. It has
full Stellar network support. So it's
full Stellar network support. So it's
full Stellar network support. So it's
really really cool stuff. Would highly
really really cool stuff. Would highly
really really cool stuff. Would highly
recommend checking it out. But for now
recommend checking it out. But for now
recommend checking it out. But for now
we'll just stick with like a standard
we'll just stick with like a standard
we'll just stick with like a standard
account. And then from there we have a
account. And then from there we have a
account. And then from there we have a
UI kit. So you can basically choose
UI kit. So you can basically choose
UI kit. So you can basically choose
which wallet kit you want to be
which wallet kit you want to be
which wallet kit you want to be
included. So right now I have just the
included. So right now I have just the
included. So right now I have just the
built by OpenZeppelin standard one.
built by OpenZeppelin standard one.
built by OpenZeppelin standard one.
It's kind of like a very minimal,
It's kind of like a very minimal,
It's kind of like a very minimal,
nothing really fancy. So I can see my
nothing really fancy. So I can see my
nothing really fancy. So I can see my
accounts connected here. I could
accounts connected here. I could
accounts connected here. I could
disconnect. but if you wanted to, you
disconnect. but if you wanted to, you
disconnect. but if you wanted to, you
could also use the Stellar walts kit.
could also use the Stellar walts kit.
could also use the Stellar walts kit.
And so you'll have, you know, a
And so you'll have, you know, a
And so you'll have, you know, a
different experience. You can kind of
different experience. You can kind of
different experience. You can kind of
customize that and choose which one you
customize that and choose which one you
customize that and choose which one you
like. I'll just go ahead and switch to

OpenZeppelin. And once we have
OpenZeppelin. And once we have
OpenZeppelin. And once we have
everything ready, , I can either just
everything ready, , I can either just
everything ready, , I can either just
go and hit next or at any point when I'm
go and hit next or at any point when I'm
go and hit next or at any point when I'm
in this, , you know, building phase, I
in this, , you know, building phase, I
in this, , you know, building phase, I
can hit preview form to view it and test
can hit preview form to view it and test
can hit preview form to view it and test
it out and then go back to building it.

So once we have it set, I could actually
So once we have it set, I could actually
So once we have it set, I could actually
go ahead and give this a shot here. So I
go ahead and give this a shot here. So I
go ahead and give this a shot here. So I
can say hello world or something like
can say hello world or something like
can say hello world or something like
that. Go ahead and do execute. And
that. Go ahead and do execute. And

that's just going to have me sign that

And there we go. It's successful. And
And there we go. It's successful. And
And there we go. It's successful. And
what's really cool is that we can just
what's really cool is that we can just
what's really cool is that we can just
hit this refresh button here. And you
hit this refresh button here. And you
hit this refresh button here. And you
can see we have our hello world that's
can see we have our hello world that's
can see we have our hello world that's
been updated in our contract state,
been updated in our contract state,
been updated in our contract state,
which is really cool. And from here, we
which is really cool. And from here, we

going to be a V react project. And you
going to be a V react project. And you
going to be a V react project. And you
could just install the dependencies,

ready to go. Now, that's only half of it
ready to go. Now, that's only half of it
ready to go. Now, that's only half of it
because that's like a really simple one
because that's like a really simple one
because that's like a really simple one

the some of the other things that the UI
the some of the other things that the UI
the some of the other things that the UI
builder has to offer is once we created
builder has to offer is once we created
builder has to offer is once we created
this UI, we can see it here under our
this UI, we can see it here under our
this UI, we can see it here under our
contract UIs here. And so as you build
contract UIs here. And so as you build
contract UIs here. And so as you build
these forms and let's say you're doing
these forms and let's say you're doing
these forms and let's say you're doing
multiple different tests or multiple
multiple different tests or multiple
multiple different tests or multiple
different forms, they're all stored in
different forms, they're all stored in
different forms, they're all stored in
your browser as local storage and you
your browser as local storage and you
your browser as local storage and you
can actually click on them here. So,
can actually click on them here. So,
can actually click on them here. So,
here's a different one that's a much
here's a different one that's a much
here's a different one that's a much
more complex form where I can put in an
more complex form where I can put in an
more complex form where I can put in an
account address. I can put an account

account address. I can put an account
label, , key values. There's a whole
label, , key values. There's a whole
label, , key values. There's a whole
lot of stuff you can put here. And so,
lot of stuff you can put here. And so,
lot of stuff you can put here. And so,
these are all kind of stored. And if I
these are all kind of stored. And if I
these are all kind of stored. And if I
wanted to, I could click on the three
wanted to, I could click on the three
wanted to, I could click on the three
dots here to rename, duplicate, export.
dots here to rename, duplicate, export.
dots here to rename, duplicate, export.
And all of this is basically just basic
And all of this is basically just basic
And all of this is basically just basic
JSON data. So at any point I can
JSON data. So at any point I can
JSON data. So at any point I can
actually export all of my current UIs
actually export all of my current UIs
actually export all of my current UIs
into a JSON file right here. And so from
into a JSON file right here. And so from
into a JSON file right here. And so from
there I can import it and if I ever
there I can import it and if I ever
there I can import it and if I ever
needed to bring it back or something
needed to bring it back or something
needed to bring it back or something
like that, it's all dated. Just click
like that, it's all dated. Just click
like that, it's all dated. Just click
import. And it brings in those forms
