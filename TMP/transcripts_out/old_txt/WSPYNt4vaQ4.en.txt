hey everybody welcome to the q a session
for jump cannon and I think
yeah jeff neal already asked three
questions
if we want to jump into those his
first question was
has the name been chosen yet
the second question was what is the
approximate test net month of launch and
then the same question for mainnet i
can try some of these things so
the name has not been selected yet
hopefully within a week or two we can
answer that question

the
generally speaking the main at launch is
scheduled for enevir
and it might slip into next year because
in the past we've learned that
making like a major release at the end
of the year is probably not the best
thing to do
so we expect end of december
beginning of january for may net and
then end of november a month before that
for testnet
and
you know the couple of months before
that were already
slated to have a like experimental
future net so just like a dedicated test
net to to work with smart contracts
on
and
just
for the full loop we also expect that by
the end of this month you'll already be
able to deploy contracts locally in a
sandbox using the sdk
it's a future very cool
let's get people to ask questions in
voice it's more interactive yeah go
ahead and
submit a request to speak if you'd like
to ask a question we will pull you on up
put you in front of the class while
we wait for people to oh never mind
we've got a request
all right life learner
yes thank you
what do you see or do you have any
initial projects
in the pipeline for the end of year
when you when you do the release
so can you repeat the beginning of the
question I missed that
so let me let me try again do you
have any projects in the pipeline
for the initial release
we're talking with several companies
that are interested in building on
Stellar I can't disclose names right
now because nothing is is finalized
but you know like the

the usual suspects of you know like
amms and various
you know lending protocols
right yeah the keep those requests
coming
tomer do you think we're gonna see
dowels being established through those
smart contracts I'm sure we'll see
dows yes
what is the first dow you would like to
see
I would like to see a dao
for
a dow building platform
so
cool yeah
great answer yeah
yeah I think I'm still I'm stealing this
from jason our ceo oh he has he's also
expressed an interest in the past and
having like a dow dow I mean it's got a
ring to it
john jove
what what's going on with the token
contract it's in progress
it exists although I actually don't
think i've posted anything publicly
really about it I mean lee and I were
just talking about it a second ago but
maybe I should actually post a link
to the repo it lives in
but
tell us a bit about the token contract
I mean there's
there's not a ton to say it's a it's a
token
it looks a lot like
like an erc20 token with the exception
that like everything is done in the
style of eip 2612 permits so there's
lots of signatures being passed around
that makes it really flexible
what I what is built so now what is
built so far isn't actually like
compliant with the spec that we
published for it
but I'm going to work on getting it
closer to spec in the next couple of
days
so probably by like I don't know I don't
want to say the end of this week but the
end of next week it'll probably be
pretty close and pretty reasonable it
won't have all the functionality but
it'll be pretty close
I'm going to post a link to that in
jump cannon right now so give me a
second
that's awesome
it works i've tested it locally it
does seem to work
and can you
share with the audience what is the
story with eip 2612
what what does it improve on the erc20
contract
yeah that's that's a good question
so basically this eip2612 which i
always refer to as eip2612 permit
because permit is like the target
function that this whole thing was done
for
basically was an improvement on the
classic erc20 approved flow
so you know basically at the beginning
of the whole erc experience or the erc20
experience what you would do is you're
like okay I have this contract I want to
interact with it I'm going to approve it
to transfer balance from my account and
so you submit a transaction
on ethereum you wait for some you
know
there's some confirmations and
eventually you're like okay this is
final and we're happy and you submit
another transaction
that actually does the
that actually like you know lets the con
interact with the contract form by
itself

and so basically you first paid cash gas
through the first thing and then you pay
gas to the second thing
with eip eip2612 permit you do this
all as a single transaction by just
passing a signature
to this permit like a signature
to this
to the contract in the first place and
then it uses the signature on the permit
function and the permit verifies the
signature and then does the same stuff
that approve would have done
so it's basically this like ergonomics
improvement

and so kind of everything here works
like that so you get that kind of
ergonomics improvement everywhere
so would it be correct to say that
the ip2612 basically

like separates the
the kind of like who's submitting that
transaction from like who's authorizing
the the
moving of the funds
that's exactly right
okay

around
sorry
you want to go do you want me to go
you go
a lot of the conversation around eip
2612 was around this like this
gasless concept basically like
I shouldn't need to have an account that
has money in it basically to do stuff or
has ethernet
and so this really like these kinds of
like you know me passing around a
signature and letting somebody else act
on it makes these kind of gases
concepts much much easier very cool
that's exactly what I was about to say
we have another question from the
audience sorry if I mispronounced
your name but jason godev asked given
that Stellar has some built-in
operations that serve off-chain scripts
and apps already what use cases will
smart contracts serve that is not
possible with the current sdks
so the current sdks are just like
extremely or you know the current
protocol is consist consists of around
20 high-level operations
which doesn't really allow you
to
to like you know express a lot of
things so say for example that I wanna
introduce an amm that is that's
built on a curve that's not supported by
the native amms on Stellar like table
swap
or let's say that I want to have like
a you know like a trust minimized
lending protocol
or kind of like a non-trivial size
dow that does
that has like you know stake weighted
voting trust minimized so all these
things are like not really doable today
great if anyone from the audience has
any questions feel free to drop them
into live chat the tech's channel or
you can go ahead and request to be
on the stage and ask your question
through voice maybe in the meantime lee
can give us a quick update on what's the
status of the sdk
what should we be expecting for this
like july iteration
and what are you
lee most excited about yeah I mean we're
still we're still working on the sdk
john has proven that you can build
something with it which is fantastic
at this point
the api is still relatively unstable
so I mean as as we talked just before

just before
this event I'm
adding things like iterators slicing to
vectors and
you know there's certain things about
the api events that are probably going
to change in the next few days to to
make them more ergonomic to make them
safe to use and so we we are really
still
the sdks really young and we're still
yeah making a lot of changes to it and
you know the end of by the time we
come to the end of july hopefully we
have a lot of the building blocks

the primitives there
in a
somewhat stable state even though the
sdk is in flash blocks I do want to
emphasize that it is quite sleek like
the stuff that works when it it's pretty
cool it's very kind of easy to use so
I had a good experience working with
that is the sdk something people can
look at right now today or is it as has
it yet to be put out into the wild
I mean the code is is public it's on
github it's just go to github.com
Stellar and I'm sure you'll find it
the docs aren't up yet the
anywhere in particular for it just yet
so
you know
if you're looking for docs then you know
that's not out yet but we should have
docks out with you know the july release
at the end of july
yeah and john's token contract is
actually a really good starting point
right now because it's it uses the
sdk it's fairly
readable and ergonomic and well
organized
for someone who who's maybe not familiar
with the way that rust works tomer like
if they do go look at john's token
contract what should they look at first
so
at any
rust
I don't remember the lingo but you
should look at the lib rs file because
that's like the entry point for any
code that is not executable
general good guideline for looking at
like a jump can and contract with the
sdk would be to go and find a function
with the with the text contract fn
directly above it
if you see that you know that's an
entry point to the contract and then you
can go and see what it does by following
that through in my particular case
right now like tomer's advice was good
all of those functions are in lib.rs
but I actually have a like a refactor
that changes that and puts them all off
into a separate file so that would still
allow you to find the right stuff
and I think the other thing to look out
for too is you'll also see types that
are
that have an attribute like contract
type at the top of them and they're all
types that will end up either in the api
or will end up being stored so if
you're familiar with like the ethereum
api or like what
types that get generated in other
ecosystems
looking for that contrapti tag you
know types that are going to be
interesting for you to look at
lee can you talk a bit about testing
in our contracts I know that testing is
like a big issue in the world of you
know solidity smart contracts I know
there are a lot of frameworks to
facilitate that
what's what's my strategy as a person
who's like developing for jump cannon
yeah it's a great question we really
want testing to be

like really smooth
mostly because you know we want
people to ride tests
whenever whenever there's a barrier to
entry to writing tests
you know let's admit it as engineers
it's it's tempting not to so

write
tests in terms of a jump cannon contract
that's written in rust will be tests
that you can run locally on your
computer in your id so if you're using
an
ide like
vs code you'll be able to just run
those tests like you would any other
rust test
your writing and
in that
in that test you'll have access to
a host that acts
very much like
the
runtime environment that your contract
will actually run on chain and the
reason acts very much like it is because
it's actually backed by the same code
because the the runtime environment is
written in rust in Stellar core and so
we basically import that into the tests
and we're running the contract within it
and much of the mechanics of that we're
still working through that and
john and
others are
really help identifying like where the
gaps are that we need to fill in to make
it work as smoothly as possible for
everybody but
yeah you'll be ideally be able to
construct a couple of contracts and
then you know run them in your test and
then inspect you know here's the here's
the state of the ledger
after running them and be able to you
know write assertions about okay you
know you expect the balance of this
account to change by this much or the
balance of this token for that account i
mean
and
it it'll be all running locally on
your system
and you'll be out which means you'll be
out of you know step three debug inspect
the values of variables
and different things like that
step three debug a smart contract that's
pretty pretty wild
okay I see we have a bunch of people
joined we are talking about jump cannon

type of stuff that we're gonna see
coming in the next few weeks
and we're happy to take questions
and we have a question in the text chat
from matthias he says with smart
contract support I wonder if you see a
possibility to build an infrastructure
like layer two of apps tap chain
side chains using Stellar as their layer
one
yeah definitely we're we also
had some folks
looking at potential like what type of
crypto primitives do we need to do zk
roll ups in an efficient matter so i
don't think this these are things that
we're going to see immediately like at
launch this year the beginning of next
year but with time we definitely
expect
more
sophisticated l2 constructions to
show up
these will probably take the form of
zika rollups and the cool thing is
that you can actually

you know like the zika roll-up can
can be something else from jump cannon
it can obviously be like another the
same execution engine but it can also be
something like an evm so you can have
like an evm roll up running on like a
Stellar base chain which is pretty cool
what about you same question that you
asked lee what are you most excited
about for for the launch of smart
contracts on Stellar like what would you
most like to see
I really love the fact
that the sdk like builds on rust
so you can use like the entire ecosystem
of rust tooling they're at your
disposal so you can do things like use
rust tooling for fuzzying or you know
the type of
testing frameworks that lee pointed out

and you know most most of all I'm
just like really excited to see what
others build and what are the things
that we're not thinking about right now
in terms of getting other people to
build you know we're just starting to
think about this but like
someone wants to get involved what's the
best way for them to to start getting
involved so
right now I would say that things are
kind of like all over the place in terms
of you know you can start reading
caps I would like I said before i
think the the best entry point right now
is through
john's contract because it's the most
like comprehensive and up-to-date jump
cannon contract
and just like learn from that
we are working on a set of docs
that should be live by the end of this
month
and these will relate to just like
learning about how this whole thing
works some examples and tutorials
around how to
like write a basic contract and use
the sdk
it will really be focused on like the
local
sandbox developer experience so you
don't need to know you
funny enough you don't really need to
know anything about Stellar in order to
start developing for this you don't even
need to have
to be talking to a Stellar network all
you need is like this local sandbox
that's in the sdk I also have another
question from matthias in terms of
infrastructure what would be your top
number one priority for smart contracts
projects
says he's thinking on Stellar mainstream
stream adoption
time frame q3 slash q4 2022 so
infrastructure
number one priority
allow people to build smart contracts
yeah I would say that the the composable
like defy
lego blocks so things like
amm specifically the type of amms
that we don't have natively in
Stellar things like you know stable
swap things like uni swap v3
definitely
interesting interested in seeing
things like compound
and I would love to see some
infrastructure for to start building
downs
no one on this call has this question
but definitely when I start to talk to
people about
about this process the first question
that people have is like oh is this evm
compatible
can you just
give a brief like highlight about the
choices the tech stack choices and why
why we made them
yeah sure so we actually put out a blog
post a couple months ago around why we
decided to to go with wasm
and we outlined a few options that we
that we considered but ended up not
going with you know the evm is like the
big
elephant in the room obviously it's
on a bunch of different
different chains from ethereum to
avalanche
and others
but at you know the bottom line was that
we were looking for something that we
can really scale the network with
and the evm
is you know has a lot of good things
about it but
there are some kind of glaring issues
that we
didn't really want to ignore
one of them is that
it just doesn't lend itself well to
parallelism which is something that is
very important for us moving forward
with the type of real world scale that
we're looking for
the other thing is that they were just a
lot of foot guns in the evm and a
lot of ways to
unintentionally

do the wrong thing
so we wanted to make sure that we build
something that is you know it's
batteries included you don't need to
you know like the token contract that
john is building right now is going to
be kind of like the native default
way to build tokens on on job canada
so you wouldn't have to do stuff like
deploy your own erc20 contract which you
know in the ethereum ecosystem everyone
just goes and like copy copy paste
you know the OpenZeppelin erc20
contract and a lot of other contracts as
well
so there's a lot of small things where
ethereum is not
like

evm is not the friendliest for
developers
and we wanna make sure that we're
we're building something that's
friendly for developers and builds for
the future
we have another question from mathias
evm compatibility you just need to
build on evm compatible using jump
cannon smart contracts like
aurora.dev or near something to think
about to bring to some
ethereum projects I guess not really
a question so much as a statement
did end with a question mark though yeah
in my defense
and I posted the the wazon blog and
the live chat channel
awesome
yeah I think aurora is a really is a
really interesting
is a really interesting example of
you know I think both near and and
avalanche
you know recognize that evm is not
really what they want to build on but at
that time from their perspective like
the way to get to market was to have
something evm compatible right so you
know avalanche came up with the c chain
which is which is
evm compatible near came up with with
aurora
and like these are fine projects and
they really show how like the you know
the
developers of the chain themselves don't
necessarily think that the evm is the
way to go but they you know they
they put in something you know aurora
is
a a complete evm that runs as a smart
contract
which is a very interesting approach
it's it's pretty wasteful both in
terms of
kind of like time and space but it also
kind of like

it kind of like ruins the benefits that
you get from near right because now you
can't actually you know all the sharding
and the parallelism that you get from
near you you don't get in aurora right
and if you look at the actual tps
numbers then they are like extremely low
so I think there's like you know there
are pros and cons to every approach
all right and moots has joined the
chat you have a question
yeah I was just hoping to ask about
an update towards 55 I believe was
the number
I think the last
Stellar dev chat we had was
on some of the fee mechanics
specifically the
underlying state exploration
and I know that was a few weeks ago and
with july 4th and all I wasn't paying a
ton a ton of close attention so I was
wondering if there was any updates you
could provide and I know it might not be
fair since niko's not here
but just kind of regarding that
no that's great niko's not here so we
can talk about cap55

I would say that
we haven't
there are some internal efforts to
to come up with
like opposing caps
so I think that cap 55 in its
current form
you know we all acknowledge that it's
a it's a huge

it's it's different from anything other
than you have out there
and we want to make sure that we
consider all the alternatives before
taking such a step so
the cap moods is talking about is cap 55
it's around fees
most of it is around
like
gas and metering and or metering
computation and and and
kind of like state allocations
that is the
the
the less offensive bit about cap 55 cap
55 also presents this idea of like state
expiration
which is that stake state can expire
after a specific time if it's not
used or not touched which is great in
terms of making sure that the
that the the ledger state size is
manageable
but introduces an additional level of
complexity for contract developers to
have to actually
both contract developers and for
users to make sure that you know
important state just doesn't like
disappear into the abyss
on that topic I highly recommend the
talk given by the geth lead developer
last month in prague
around this

kind of like time bomb that's in
basically like any uvm chain out there
which is you know like the state is
growing in a rate where commodity
hardware
won't be able to handle it soon
enough and a lot of the evm chains out
there that are just kind of like
cranking up the tps numbers they're just
gonna hit that wall a lot sooner
so you know we wanna make sure that
you know we're
cognizant about this issue and and have
some
strategy to mitigate it
cool thanks for the update and we have a
question from jason c
how is develop development of linking
Stellar classic tokens and their
potential smart contract equivalents
looking
will classic tokens and their smart
wrapped versions be interoperable in the
background
or will developers need to create their
own wrapped versions that users will
need to trade between
this one's for me I can tell

so
this is a good question
and the
wrong one
the interoperability
really comes from the contracts that
smart rather the
the contracts that other developers
built
the native token contract that we're
going to provide
is going to have good interoperability
between classic assets and
smart assets so you know
basically if you use that and you know
the contract that you build is
compatible with that
contract the native contract then
you're good to go
but like let's say that you like some
other kind of you know token you know on
ethereum there are more types of tokens
than just erc20 tokens

maybe that's not a good compatibility
fit for you and then you don't get the
interoperability guaranteed
but
in like the most basic case where you
have a Stellar asset classic asset it's
fun it's like a fundable asset like
it's a
argentinian peso for example
then like you should expect to have
excellent interoperability with with a
smart contract assuming that the native
contract we're providing is widely
adopted I'm saying
same question regarding nfts
sorry I think I just cut you off john
but I think you were just going to read
that question out right
yeah I was going to do that I was also
going to ask if jason was the ceo and
then I asked that question
with regard to the
to the nfts
tomer has asked me the same question
about like what we should be doing for
like nft interoperability against like
classic nfts
and I basically told tomer like i
haven't thought about and i'll think
about it in august
so I don't know the answers to that
question yet

tomer might have some insights on that
regard in terms of what he thinks should
happen so i'll turn it over to tomorrow
here
yeah I think that's a that's a very
good question that we need to to figure
out
I don't think fred is in the audience
right now but I would love to get fred's
take on it whether we need to have
this like
opinionated like default nft contract
you know the type of nfts that you
can issue in and by enlightenment
today are still interoperable with
jump cannon in the sense that any
token from classic is interoperable
through these like rap tokens
the question
is
do we want to introduce like a native
representation on on the on the smart
side and what form should it take should
it just be
like this regular token with you know
with like zero decimal places

those are open questions and I think we
need to kind of like survey
nft contracts in the ecosystem to better
understand that
and that's like john said that work
is slated for next month all right
matthias has another question I'm glad
he labeled it as a question for me are
there any current education Stellar
partners such as Stellar quest or the
like working on trading and or
education in preparation for jump
cannons launch
smooth onboarding for devs
no not yet but that's definitely
planned you know like I said right
now the you know the docs and the
materials are just like not in a place
where
where it's easy to onboard but it's a
it's a very top priority for us to get
there
I think maybe seashells wanted to be in
the recording so seashells has
wished us all a happy thursday
we have pantheon wants to speak
here you go
I just I don't know if you can answer
this quickly or not it's more of a
security question as to do you see
any security flaws with this platform or
any potential issues
particularly
right now if current security flaws if
if someone gets a hold of your secret
key your wallet's exposed would this
smart contract be kind of in the same
situation where if someone has
a secret key access that's that the
whole smart contract is now exposed or

I would say that smart contracts
introduce
a lot of
you know they allow
contract developers to write arbitrary
code
that is deployed on chain
it's
it definitely
is
more powerful than the current protocol
but it definitely
gives developers some more rope to hang
themselves with
from the actual platform security
perspective we're planning on multiple
audits to ensure that the platform
itself is
is safe
with that said
you know it's
it's impossible
to
enforce safeness in the protocol level
and it will be
up to developers to ensure that the
contracts that they write are safe we
are going to
publish a lot of information on how to
maintain security
and we are also planning on a grants
program that will include
grants for auditing
but at the end of the day
there
how should I put it
you know like
shitty code will exist and it will be
unsafe
you can never stop it but
yeah I just want to know the
likelihood and like
sort of the the system that's being
created the the possibility of of
that happening but overall thank you for
the answering that
we have one more question from the text
channel can you talk a little bit
about anchors and jump canon yeah so
from the anchors perspective they don't
actually need to to change anything
about their offerings
because you know the type of assets that
they're dealing with are classic assets
and they can
so nothing really changes about about
the on and off ramp
if
if they're
you know they could if they choose to
on-ramp directly to smart to the smart
side or allow off-ramping through
that but we expect wallets to be able
to
to officially move assets between these
two sides so
that is not necessarily a required
thing
for
you know for issuers
even issuers of classic assets
could
with their existing issue or
authorization they can move to mint over
on the
on the smart side for the same asset the
exact same asset
one advantage of that you know we hear a
lot from from issuers
that
Stellar's model of like implicit
minting through payments is
sometimes
a bit idiosyncratic idiosyncratic for
how they do things on other networks and
the nice thing about the
the standard token contract on the smart
side is that there's an explicit mint
operation
which makes things a bit more
palatable so maybe we'll see issuers
move to
minting on the smart side but I'm not
sure
so I think we're we passed the 35
minute mark and if there are no other
questions maybe we can call it a
day
if you do have other questions for us
come find us in the jump cannon channel
we're you can probably tell that
we're in the dev channel all the time
but talk to us in the normal one and
we'll we'll definitely respond to you
guys
