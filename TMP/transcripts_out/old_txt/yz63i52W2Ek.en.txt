entry extensions well with the yeah
entry extensions well with the yeah

with the default change like that they
with the default change like that they
with the default change like that they
would be created
would be created
would be created
with the this extension
with the this extension
with the this extension
and and then when we do the so
and and then when we do the so
and and then when we do the so
basically we create like a snapshot of
basically we create like a snapshot of
basically we create like a snapshot of
the ledger right
the ledger right
the ledger right
and then we run a bunch of tests for
and then we run a bunch of tests for
and then we run a bunch of tests for
different protocol versions
different protocol versions
different protocol versions
and here the protocol version is
and here the protocol version is
and here the protocol version is
obviously in like for older protocol
obviously in like for older protocol
obviously in like for older protocol
versions this would be invalid an

invalid ledger state
invalid ledger state
invalid ledger state
so I think there's a bunch of
so I think there's a bunch of
so I think there's a bunch of
refactoring that needs to be done I mean
refactoring that needs to be done I mean
refactoring that needs to be done I mean
they've been involved ledger state

well an account with such an extension
well an account with such an extension
well an account with such an extension
is not valid as of today right

so I mean what what happened when you
so I mean what what happened when you
so I mean what what happened when you
upgraded to account entry extension v2
upgraded to account entry extension v2
upgraded to account entry extension v2
why is this any different from the v2 v1
why is this any different from the v2 v1
why is this any different from the v2 v1
to v2
beyond v2 was an opt-in right like it
beyond v2 was an opt-in right like it

clarify something here is the

the way that the proposal is currently
the way that the proposal is currently
the way that the proposal is currently
written I think what I'm understanding

is that
is that
is that
when an account is created it'll
when an account is created it'll
when an account is created it'll
automatically have an accounting entry
automatically have an accounting entry
automatically have an accounting entry
extension v3 at that point there's no

and yeah so basically like the reason
and yeah so basically like the reason
and yeah so basically like the reason
that this will be confusing david is
that this will be confusing david is
that this will be confusing david is
that like
that like
that like
there's like
there's like
there's like
old historical tests which is a lot of
old historical tests which is a lot of
old historical tests which is a lot of
the tests like many thousands possibly
the tests like many thousands possibly
the tests like many thousands possibly
tens of thousands of tests
tens of thousands of tests
tens of thousands of tests
were written such a way that like the
were written such a way that like the
were written such a way that like the
setup was done in the current protocol

version and then you like time travel
version and then you like time travel

backwards in time and do the tests in
backwards in time and do the tests in
backwards in time and do the tests in
the appropriate protocol version
the appropriate protocol version
the appropriate protocol version
so we'd have to go and fix that
so we'd have to go and fix that
so we'd have to go and fix that
yeah
yeah
yeah
so you're saying that right now if i
so you're saying that right now if i
so you're saying that right now if i
create a new
create a new
create a new
you're saying that right now if I create
you're saying that right now if I create
you're saying that right now if I create
a new account I don't get an account
a new account I don't get an account
a new account I don't get an account
entry extension v2 correct you you just
entry extension v2 correct you you just
entry extension v2 correct you you just
have null extension
now maybe there's an argument that we
now maybe there's an argument that we
should go and fix our tests anyway
should go and fix our tests anyway
should go and fix our tests anyway
yeah I mean that's why I was saying like
yeah I mean that's why I was saying like
yeah I mean that's why I was saying like
it's a it's a trade-off right like can i
it's a it's a trade-off right like can i
it's a it's a trade-off right like can i
write you can I write you like an xdr
write you can I write you like an xdr
write you can I write you like an xdr
converter that will automatically I mean
converter that will automatically I mean
converter that will automatically I mean
it seems like we could
I mean do the tests have like specific
I mean do the tests have like specific
like shot 256 hash values of ledger
like shot 256 hash values of ledger
like shot 256 hash values of ledger
state is that the problem
well they can't though because there's
well they can't though because there's
other there's other values like like the
other there's other values like like the
other there's other values like like the
ledger number and stuff that aren't

there so what so what specifically is it
there so what so what specifically is it
there so what so what specifically is it
that fails in the test
that fails in the test
that fails in the test
like maybe there's just like an xdr
