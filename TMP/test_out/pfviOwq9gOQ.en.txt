let's just go ahead and keep working
let's just go ahead and keep working
let's just go ahead and keep working
through the tutorial here. So, first
through the tutorial here. So, first
through the tutorial here. So, first
things first, we have this NV example
things first, we have this NV example
things first, we have this NV example
file. Now you can either copy this over
file. Now you can either copy this over

and make a new one or just edit the
and make a new one or just edit the
and make a new one or just edit the
existing title to just say end. And
existing title to just say end. And
existing title to just say end. And
we're going to change some of the
we're going to change some of the
we're going to change some of the
parameters here. So you see uh the
parameters here. So you see uh the
parameters here. So you see uh the
standalone or the public sorbar network
standalone or the public sorbar network
standalone or the public sorbar network
passphrase is actually going to target
passphrase is actually going to target
passphrase is actually going to target
the standalone network. Um so we're
the standalone network. Um so we're
the standalone network. Um so we're
going to erase this value and we're
going to erase this value and we're
going to erase this value and we're
going to go ahead and inject the Soraon
going to go ahead and inject the Soraon
going to go ahead and inject the Soraon
endpoint here. So, public Soroban network
endpoint here. So, public Soroban network
endpoint here. So, public Soroban network
passphrase or excuse me, not the Sorbon
passphrase or excuse me, not the Sorbon
passphrase or excuse me, not the Sorbon
RP uh we won't be injecting the Sorbon
RP uh we won't be injecting the Sorbon
RP uh we won't be injecting the Sorbon
URL here, but the passphrase instead.
URL here, but the passphrase instead.
URL here, but the passphrase instead.
So, we have test SDF network uh
So, we have test SDF network uh
So, we have test SDF network uh
September 2015 is the passphrase, this
September 2015 is the passphrase, this
September 2015 is the passphrase, this
correct passphrase for testn net. Then
correct passphrase for testn net. Then
correct passphrase for testn net. Then
we're going to go ahead and change our
we're going to go ahead and change our
we're going to go ahead and change our
public Soroban RPC URL to the correct
public Soroban RPC URL to the correct
public Soroban RPC URL to the correct
endpoint here which is https
endpoint here which is https
endpoint here which is https
semicolon/sorbond
Okay. And we already have a Sorbon
Okay. And we already have a Sorbon
account called Alice and we're going to
account called Alice and we're going to
account called Alice and we're going to
uh just specify the network to be test
uh just specify the network to be test
uh just specify the network to be test
net. All right.
net. All right.

So let's go ahead and clear this out.
So let's go ahead and clear this out.
So let's go ahead and clear this out.
All right. So, what do we have here?
All right. So, what do we have here?
All right. So, what do we have here?
Okay. We're looking at our um we're
Okay. We're looking at our um we're
Okay. We're looking at our um we're
looking at our what's it called? Our
looking at our what's it called? Our
looking at our what's it called? Our
project so far. And we've also updated
project so far. And we've also updated
project so far. And we've also updated
our environment file. So, what we're
our environment file. So, what we're
our environment file. So, what we're
going to do next is actually just
going to do next is actually just
going to do next is actually just
install some of the dependencies. We're
install some of the dependencies. We're
install some of the dependencies. We're
going to do that by running mpm install.
going to do that by running mpm install.
going to do that by running mpm install.
All right. So, let's go ahead and take a
All right. So, let's go ahead and take a
All right. So, let's go ahead and take a
look at what's happening here. All
look at what's happening here. All
look at what's happening here. All
right. So, nothing special here. We're
right. So, nothing special here. We're
right. So, nothing special here. We're
just running mpm install uh installing
just running mpm install uh installing
just running mpm install uh installing
the uh the dependencies for the project.
the uh the dependencies for the project.
the uh the dependencies for the project.
Sorry. So, we're going to go ahead and
Sorry. So, we're going to go ahead and
Sorry. So, we're going to go ahead and
run mpm run init for the next uh for the
run mpm run init for the next uh for the
run mpm run init for the next uh for the
next step. And what this is going to do
next step. And what this is going to do
next step. And what this is going to do
is it's actually going to run the
is it's actually going to run the
is it's actually going to run the
initialize.js

initialize.js
file. So, uh while this is loading,
file. So, uh while this is loading,
file. So, uh while this is loading,
let's just go ahead and kind of just
let's just go ahead and kind of just
let's just go ahead and kind of just
like take a look at what's happening
like take a look at what's happening
like take a look at what's happening
here. Um, all right. So, we're
here. Um, all right. So, we're
here. Um, all right. So, we're
processing the public key, uh, right?
processing the public key, uh, right?
processing the public key, uh, right?
And then we're actually going to use
And then we're actually going to use
And then we're actually going to use
that to deploy the, uh, the smart
that to deploy the, uh, the smart
that to deploy the, uh, the smart
contract. So, we're going to use that as
contract. So, we're going to use that as
contract. So, we're going to use that as
the signer, uh, to deploy to pay the fee
the signer, uh, to deploy to pay the fee
the signer, uh, to deploy to pay the fee
for deploying the smart contract itself.
for deploying the smart contract itself.
for deploying the smart contract itself.
All right. So, we're using the CLI
All right. So, we're using the CLI
All right. So, we're using the CLI
command, uh, the stellar CLI. All right.
command, uh, the stellar CLI. All right.
command, uh, the stellar CLI. All right.
So, we're going to say we're going to
So, we're going to say we're going to
So, we're going to say we're going to
generate a new account, which we defined
generate a new account, which we defined
generate a new account, which we defined
here, right? Sorbon account equals
here, right? Sorbon account equals
here, right? Sorbon account equals
Alice. So we're going to say stellar
Alice. So we're going to say stellar
Alice. So we're going to say stellar
keys generate and then we're going to
keys generate and then we're going to
keys generate and then we're going to
say Alice. But we've already done that.
say Alice. But we've already done that.
say Alice. But we've already done that.
So you can think of this um uh function
So you can think of this um uh function
So you can think of this um uh function
here as kind of like recursively or
here as kind of like recursively or
here as kind of like recursively or
redoing the step where we fund an
redoing the step where we fund an
redoing the step where we fund an
account that we would pay for the
account that we would pay for the
account that we would pay for the
deployment fees with. Um but we've
deployment fees with. Um but we've
deployment fees with. Um but we've
already generated that. All right. And
already generated that. All right. And
already generated that. All right. And
then we're going to uh build the files.
then we're going to uh build the files.
then we're going to uh build the files.
Right. So what does that mean? We're
Right. So what does that mean? We're
Right. So what does that mean? We're
going to use stellar CLI contract build
going to use stellar CLI contract build
going to use stellar CLI contract build
which is going to compile the uh the
which is going to compile the uh the
which is going to compile the uh the
smart contract files right again in

to store it in the target directory
to store it in the target directory
here. Next, it's going to use uh so
here. Next, it's going to use uh so
here. Next, it's going to use uh so
stellar CLI contract deploy. It's going
stellar CLI contract deploy. It's going
stellar CLI contract deploy. It's going
to specify the WASM file, right? And
to specify the WASM file, right? And
to specify the WASM file, right? And
then it's going to uh deploy that right
then it's going to uh deploy that right
then it's going to uh deploy that right
to test net. Um uh once it takes once it
to test net. Um uh once it takes once it
to test net. Um uh once it takes once it
deploys the contract to test net it's
deploys the contract to test net it's
deploys the contract to test net it's
going to record the contract ID and then
going to record the contract ID and then
going to record the contract ID and then
it's going to build the TypeScript
it's going to build the TypeScript
it's going to build the TypeScript

this part is pretty important because um
this part is pretty important because um

exactly does that mean? Well, when we
exactly does that mean? Well, when we
exactly does that mean? Well, when we
create a client, um you can think of
create a client, um you can think of
create a client, um you can think of
this as creating like a smart contract
this as creating like a smart contract
this as creating like a smart contract
object. Um when we created the

happening. Uh you see some imports
happening. Uh you see some imports
happening. Uh you see some imports
coming from the stellar SDK. Well,
coming from the stellar SDK. Well,
coming from the stellar SDK. Well,
that's because uh you actually
that's because uh you actually
that's because uh you actually
uh you create your own node module sets
uh you create your own node module sets
uh you create your own node module sets
for the stellar SD or for the uh smart

All right, so simple enough. We're
All right, so simple enough. We're
All right, so simple enough. We're
awaiting a a function here and the
awaiting a a function here and the
awaiting a a function here and the
method is hello. We're going to define

Make sure. Okay. Cool. Cool. So you guys
Make sure. Okay. Cool. Cool. So you guys
can see

that really applies to us. So con result
that really applies to us. So con result

equals await hello world. Hello to you.
equals await hello world. Hello to you.
equals await hello world. Hello to you.
Let's say hello and world.
An error occurred. Must be a host value.
An error occurred. Must be a host value.
So
So
So
believe it was the exclamation mark. All
believe it was the exclamation mark. All
believe it was the exclamation mark. All
right, cool. So we have hello world. So
right, cool. So we have hello world. So
right, cool. So we have hello world. So
we're actually able to change that. Um
we're actually able to change that. Um
we're actually able to change that. Um
this is we're able to do this because
this is we're able to do this because
this is we're able to do this because
we're we're not actually making a call
we're we're not actually making a call
we're we're not actually making a call
to the back end. So, we're just using a

Now, one cool thing about Sorbon uh the

the Sorbon SDK. Uh so what does this
the Sorbon SDK. Uh so what does this
the Sorbon SDK. Uh so what does this
mean? This means that the user has to

have the address that is making the

address B for this call. And this
address B for this call. And this
address B for this call. And this
require off method ensures that the
require off method ensures that the
require off method ensures that the
wallet being used to make the call is
wallet being used to make the call is
wallet being used to make the call is
actually is actually the one making the

call. This cannot be another wallet's
call. This cannot be another wallet's

assert that the wallet making the call
assert that the wallet making the call
assert that the wallet making the call
um is using the same value as the
