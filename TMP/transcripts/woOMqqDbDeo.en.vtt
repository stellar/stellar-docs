00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
the chat yeah we're live all right hello hi everyone it's a pleasure to

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.200
have you with us today i my name is lisa nester i am a

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.800
senior strategist at the stellar development foundation and you are joining us for our

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.400
third roundtable discussion second topic that we've ever covered and we are very happy

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.000
to have you with us today so i guess to get started i'd love

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.600
to kind of frame again the purpose of these roundtable discussions hopefully we're going

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.200
to have a lot of audience members and viewers joining in and we'd love

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.800
to invite you into the discussion as well and then i'll jump into what

9
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.400
the topic for today is so in general at the stellar development foundation you

10
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.000
know we want to make sure that we're facilitating broad inclusive ecosystem driven discussion

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.600
around the types of tools that the stuller ecosystem needs to continue to grow

12
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.200
on and have successful use cases and businesses utilizing stuller and so in that

13
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.800
regard we've started these enterprise roundtable discussions to invite key enterprises within the stellar

14
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.400
ecosystem to sit down at a table with various members of the seller development

15
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.1000
foundation to discuss topics that are really timely and important for the growth of

16
00:01:23.1000 --> 00:01:29.600
the ecosystem right now and as i've mentioned we also live stream these events

17
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200
and have a q a box for any viewers so that we really can

18
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.800
do our best to include all of the voices in the ecosystem so if

19
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.400
you're watching us and you have comments or questions as we go through this

20
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.1000
discussion please drop them in the chat box and we'll do our best to

21
00:01:51.1000 --> 00:01:57.600
respond and include those perspectives so for the discussion today we're going to be

22
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.200
talking about custodial versus non-custodial applications in the stellar ecosystem and so why is

23
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.800
this an important topic well the truth is that if you're building a product

24
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.400
on stuller or any blockchain network really one of the first things you have

25
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.1000
to figure out is how to manage your user secret keys there are two

26
00:02:19.1000 --> 00:02:25.600
fundamentally different approaches that are seemingly practically and philosophically at odds custodial solution keeps

27
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.200
keep keys on behalf of users and non-custodial solutions put keys into users hands

28
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.800
and i think most of us would agree that during the early days of

29
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.400
stuller and also within the broader crypto landscape non-custodial wallet designs were kind of

30
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.1000
by and far the default in my opinion this is because the novelty of

31
00:02:47.1000 --> 00:02:53.600
kind of being your own bank and having direct access to digital assets drove

32
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.200
forward applications and wallets that were primarily not custodial nature however as the stellar

33
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.800
ecosystem has grown over the last few years we have seen more custodial design

34
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.400
approaches by enterprise and our ecosystem so that's why we're opening up this discussion

35
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.1000
today because we've seen a lot of growth in applications on stuller that are

36
00:03:15.1000 --> 00:03:21.600
getting more and more users we think it's a great time to check in

37
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.200
on how wallets are currently set up experiences people are having and how they're

38
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.800
thinking about moving forward and then also we have two at least two kind

39
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.400
of specific technical developments within the stellar ecosystem that are worth checking in on

40
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.1000
as they're related to the specific topic at hand so one is cap 27

41
00:03:43.1000 --> 00:03:49.600
so cap 27 is allows first class multi multiplex accounts this was included in

42
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.200
protocol 13 and it basically allows services to map a single seller account to

43
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.800
multiple users and it could make custodial solutions a lot easier to build on

44
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.400
the other hand we also have sep 30 which is a recovery signer and

45
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.1000
this defines an api that enables a user to regain access to a stellar

46
00:04:11.1000 --> 00:04:17.600
account after losing a private key without providing a third party control of the

47
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.200
account we're actually really lucky to have the key architect for step 30 lee

48
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.800
from the sdf joining us today and this solution in particular is something that

49
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.400
could make non-custodial solutions a bit easier so kind of checking in on where

50
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.1000
things are at and also thinking about these two new technical developments this is

51
00:04:39.1000 --> 00:04:45.600
going to be the focus of our discussion today on custodial versus non-custodial solutions

52
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.200
so with that i would love to get started and i would love to

53
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.800
start by having our fantastic guests join us i will call you out just

54
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.400
because we're on screen and not in person so if i can invite marco

55
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.000
to stardust hello thanks for having us here my name is marco i am

56
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.600
one of the co-founders at saldo mx and anchor service for the mexican peso

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.200
wonderful thanks marco all right how about meinhard next yes so yeah my name

58
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.800
is mayanhard and i'm the ceo and founder of satoshi pay and recently we

59
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.400
launched d transfer which is a b2b cross-border money transfer service and that's kind

60
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.000
of the main focus of what we're doing right now awesome and actually for

61
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.600
god i said that i was going to ask a special surprise question so

62
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.200
we'll come back to you marco and this goes straight to you mine hard

63
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.800
any new quarantine hobbies that you've picked up over the last nine months we'll

64
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.400
say 20 20 new hobbies not strictly your hobby but i meditate every day

65
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.000
so that's going to be something i picked up okay this time yeah awesome

66
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.600
marco well this is exactly i mean not a hobby either but i've been

67
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.200
like learning a lot of cooking months so yeah and i enjoy it so

68
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.800
happy hopefully other people are enjoying it too that's awesome that's great cool and

69
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.400
then i will turn it over to you christian yes thanks for having me

70
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.000
i'm christian the cto and co-founder of d-stock so we do tokenized securities such

71
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.600
as apple and tesla and make them tradeable on the decks and yeah we're

72
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.200
live since i think not two or three months and have looked deep into

73
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.800
custodial solutions quite late great and any quarantine hobbies that you picked up not

74
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.400
really hobbies actually so actually the thing is in germany there was a lockdown

75
00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.000
of schools as well so i was like after doing a lot of cryptographic

76
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.600
math in the last year i was doing a lot of primary school mars

77
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.200
this year when i was had to teach my daughter so that has become

78
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.800
my hobby that's fair enough that's good all right and so next i'll hand

79
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.400
it over to justin from the sdf hi i'm justin head of ecosystem at

80
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.000
the stellar development foundation excited to be here obviously well my team we care

81
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.600
a lot about what the ecosystem is doing and whenever there are improvements or

82
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.200
changes part of what we try to find out is whether they work for

83
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.800
the ecosystem and also how to get them out there so that everybody's using

84
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.400
them in a way that makes things interoperable so very interested to hear people's

85
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.000
feedback my quarantine hobby so far is asbestos remediation that's an important hobby i

86
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.600
hope everyone everyone checks it out any homeowner should make sure to develop that

87
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.200
hobby i live in an old house and it turns out there was a

88
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.800
lot of asbestos and okay that just becomes a consuming thing it can yeah

89
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.400
absolutely okay and then last but not least lee yeah hi i'm i'm liam

90
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.000
khalik i'm a software engineer at the stellar development foundation and i contribute to

91
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.600
sets like sub 30 septem and yeah i'm just really interested in custodial and

92
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.200
non-custodial solutions and how we make them interoperable well sounds like you're in the

93
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.800
right place lee but you can you don't get away without letting us know

94
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.400
if you have any quarantine hobbies as well similar similar similar to christian definitely

95
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.000
became a teacher as well okay those are skills that will pay off though

96
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.600
i'm sure so that's great i myself picked up skateboarding and this thing called

97
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.200
a rip stick a little bit that's kind of like a cool that was

98
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.800
you know a good way to when maybe there's no commute it was a

99
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.400
nice way to spend the afternoons after work so okay great well i would

100
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.000
love to dive in i guess straight into the meat of it which is

101
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.600
i'd love to hear what each of you are doing for your current custodial

102
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.200
strategy with estoc and saldo and satoshi bay and you know maybe a little

103
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.800
bit about why you chose that approach and how you're thinking about things now

104
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.400
moving forward so minehart perhaps we'll start with you sure so at satoshi bay

105
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.000
we essentially have three major services one is the micro payment service that we're

106
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.600
known for micropayment for digital content then there's obviously the solar wallet open source

107
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.200
stellar wallet and then recently there's d transfer and all of all of them

108
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.800
use a wallet solution that's self-custodial and i'm saying self-control here because internally we

109
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.400
use that word instead of non-custodial because we think non-custodial is a bit misleading

110
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.000
because there is a custodian which is yourself and so we chose to be

111
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.600
self-custodial essentially just to have everything be software and all the trust is in

112
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.200
software and not in any external party not even us this helps us to

113
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.800
move further or to release products to the market much quicker and also has

114
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.400
removed a huge overhead in potential regulation or regulatory regulatory requirements that we have

115
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.000
to fulfill so we can just push out the software and sort of have

116
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.600
people manage their own private keys and therefore being really just a software provider

117
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.200
in that sense and that being said so for d transfer we recently also

118
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.800
released a self custodial resolution on monday actually to production and here we really

119
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.400
give users the full control over the funds and also the reason again is

120
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.000
a regulatory one however in the future we plan to give users a choice

121
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.600
maybe that they can either have a custodial solution by us or by some

122
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.200
other external the custodial party that we partner with or even combine both approaches

123
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.800
that's super interesting i mean is that something that would be a relatively easy

124
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.400
opt-in decision to kind of automate from a back-end perspective or would these need

125
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.000
to be two totally separate kind of infrastructure solutions so yeah so the combination

126
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.600
would be very separate or not very but a pretty separate legal let's say

127
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.200
connections that we have with our users and also technically it would be quite

128
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.800
different yeah so that's also where the different caps and steps come into play

129
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.400
each on their side so it's going to be quite some development work and

130
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.000
also some some let's say legal ground work that we have to lay first

131
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.600
what is motivating you to consider adding this second solution where you provide custody

132
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.200
mainly user experience because a lot of the customers we have are not familiar

133
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.800
with this sort of power that self has so also the power to lose

134
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.400
your money essentially and that is something we want to maybe give users the

135
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.000
choice if they you know want to be in full control or if they

136
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.600
trust us with a certain amount of of their money or even all of

137
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.200
their money like a more like a bank-like service it's also right now we

138
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.800
didn't find a custody partner yet and also we're not regulated in that way

139
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.400
so it's we can't actually legally launch a self or sorry a custodial solution

140
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.000
at this point but we can launch the self custodial and that's why we

141
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.600
move forward with that with that we can now handle bigger transactions as well

142
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.200
as much as there's digits and there's let's say a stellar code we can

143
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.800
we can add like even very large amounts if we want that's great i

144
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.400
really want to dive into some of those points more specifically around you know

145
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.000
the usability side of things and i'm also kind of curious to hear for

146
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.600
the users that you think would want a non-custodial solution kind of what is

147
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.200
a driver or motivator there as well but maybe let's go ahead and jump

148
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.800
to marco to get a little bit more of our landscape about where we're

149
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.400
all currently or where you're currently sitting yeah thanks well philosophically i'm personally very

150
00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.000
aligned with the self-custody movement that you know cryptocurrency has started and i don't

151
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.600
see for example in in single asset blockchain such as bitcoin the really the

152
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.200
need of of thinking through like custodial solutions but however i i've i've seen

153
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.800
stellar since the very beginning seeing and realizing the market opportunity of representing real-world

154
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.400
assets on on on this public network and allow exchanges and and transfers and

155
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.000
that requires a lot of companies like ours to that are regulated entities capable

156
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.600
of of holding value for on the behalf of their users to participate and

157
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.200
the needs actually that these companies have is is they're very different because like

158
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.800
they want to leverage the this ability to hold people's funds and and be

159
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.400
able to to like improve usability as much as possible and remove any any

160
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:56.000
friction that can be created by by the self-custody approach which we all know

161
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.600
very well and i think what what we've seen is under development especially you

162
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.200
know from from from the ecosystem of standards that can help expand those custodial

163
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.800
solutions and and and i think that's something that we should think through more

164
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.400
and focus because the same way that in cryptocurrency has has been like expanding

165
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.000
thanks in big part to exchanges which are custodial solutions i think that it

166
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.600
at the end of the day it will be extremely beneficial for all if

167
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.200
more custodial solutions are able to to adopt the the kind of the stellar

168
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.800
protocol in in in a way that makes sense for them and in that

169
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.400
way increase the use of of the whole network and and benefit including like

170
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.000
those players that are that are using self-custody solutions yeah i mean i think

171
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.600
that this is you know it's i think there's kind of a philosophical point

172
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.200
of tension here where you know i think many of the people within the

173
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.800
stellar community really like the financial sovereignty that blockchain can provide but there's also

174
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.400
typically a deep desire to create impact to use a platform like stellar to

175
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.000
provide more access to financial products and services for everyone right and so how

176
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.600
do we do that in really simple ways or how do we do that

177
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.200
in ways that work across user types outside of just people who really understand

178
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.800
cryptocurrency so but marco can you help clarify how does saldo actually work how

179
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.400
are you set up right now yeah so we we as an anchor support

180
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.000
like both like approaches so if someone wants to you know utilize our services

181
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.600
through a non-custodial solution like lobster they can go ahead and do it but

182
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.200
we're also maintaining a service that it's called smx that it's our custodial solution

183
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.800
that we believe it's really important for for for the business development of of

184
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.400
our company so that basically is a very easy way to to use a

185
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.000
wallet that allows especially mexicans who are in in the us working hard and

186
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.600
sending money over to hold a little bit of mexican pesos in in in

187
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:27.200
a digital way and and that replaces the need to go and cross the

188
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.800
border and open a bank account which is almost impossible for for the majority

189
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.400
of them so like we are really focusing on this community which is not

190
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:44.000
tech savvy he's not a part of the crypto community at all and and

191
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.600
and we've been like super motivated from from what we've seen and and and

192
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.200
and this is a community that actually could not care less about like the

193
00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.800
self sovereign aspect of crypto but they just want like the task to be

194
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.400
done and so they we've been like developing these with these people in mind

195
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.000
and and that's for our company a big focus right now and and and

196
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.600
and we also want to make it compatible with with any other stellar-based solution

197
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.200
but in our in in in our approach this is a fully custodial way

198
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.800
of doing the of using our anchor gotcha and it sounds like you already

199
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.400
have some thoughts on where there could be more support within the stellar ecosystem

200
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.000
for being able to kind of launch these types of products yeah i i

201
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.600
think that you know they're already there a lot of interesting discussions like the

202
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.200
like the moxed like multiplexed accounts that you mentioned but probably we yeah we

203
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:56.800
and i'm sure we will talk more about this later on but i think

204
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.400
that it's it's in general very interesting just to kind of like see what

205
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.000
the users are doing and and and and just like see that basically the

206
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.600
entire world it's it's it's gonna take a long time for for for the

207
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.200
majority of people to adopt like the self-custody tools out there and i think

208
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.800
that we should like be kind of like aware that there's a path towards

209
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.400
that kind of like decentralization and in the meantime it's really important to serve

210
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.000
the people that they want to be served in a in a specific way

211
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.600
and and for us like we are at a stage in which is really

212
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.200
important to to provide a custodial and easy to use solutions like like this

213
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.800
great yeah and i think we definitely will dive into some of these various

214
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.400
things like multiplexed accounts more so great thank you so much marco and christian

215
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.000
i know you guys have had an interesting journey with these talks so we'd

216
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.600
love to hear about what you guys are using how you set things up

217
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.200
and how you're thinking about the future yeah i already have a lot of

218
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.800
points i want to touch on so yeah maybe i can start with there

219
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.400
are actually two different ways how you or multiple ways actually how you can

220
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.1000
use these stock technologies so first of all there's an api layer which basically

221
00:20:31.1000 --> 00:20:37.600
everyone can use it uses stellar standards and people can build products on top

222
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.200
of it and for that one we actually don't have any opinion on what

223
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.800
the user how the user protects his key his or her keys so we

224
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.400
just basically verify the user and where he's coming from if it's not like

225
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.1000
a terrorist something like that and then they can use their account to trade

226
00:20:59.1000 --> 00:21:05.600
our assets but we as well that's our actually main product do we have

227
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.200
a mobile app and because countries we serve emerging markets there's a mobile first

228
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.800
approach and this app is actually not targeting crypto users so if you want

229
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.400
to use if you're a stellar heavy user and you want to use these

230
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.1000
stock assets you can use for example lobster wallet or something like that but

231
00:21:27.1000 --> 00:21:33.600
for already non-crypto users who are new to investing and haven't had touch points

232
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.200
at all with crypto in the past it's actually quite quite of a hard

233
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.800
concept to grasp to create a private key so like currently in our onboarding

234
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.400
process which is self custodial i'm going to start to use this word as

235
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.1000
well it's an xd minor the people actually in the onboarding process have to

236
00:21:55.1000 --> 00:22:01.600
create a private key and we see actually some some kind of a drop-off

237
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.200
rate right on that so it's like people have a hard time doing that

238
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.800
so i understand that they're a bit scared maybe they don't understand it and

239
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.400
things like that so that that's a problem actually to us and i think

240
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.1000
to to everyone who wants to build end user product that's not just targeting

241
00:22:23.1000 --> 00:22:29.600
early adopted adopters and the tricky part on this one is like in the

242
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.200
very heart of d stock is that d stock itself does not hold customer

243
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.800
customers funds so that's that's the basic idea how how we can actually pull

244
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.400
off the entire business and that's true for for most of of crypto companies

245
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.1000
i guess that they don't hold customers funds and are therefore eligible to cut

246
00:22:51.1000 --> 00:22:57.600
off a lot of middlemen that are normally required in financial transactions and yeah

247
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.200
so basically if we want to want to go away from that and we're

248
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.800
actually planning to do that so we need to we want to find a

249
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.400
solution that makes it easier for undo this we have to go to some

250
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.1000
way that's not only self-custodial and i'm not saying well let me phrase it

251
00:23:19.1000 --> 00:23:25.600
differently the first thing that we need to define or that we have to

252
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.200
talk about is what actually does custodian what what does the custodial solution mean

253
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.800
in this case and this definition isn't actually as clear as i would as

254
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.400
one would guess so we're always talking about okay they're self solving their self-custodial

255
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.1000
solutions and custodial solutions but the definition of custodial is quite a bit more

256
00:23:47.1000 --> 00:23:53.600
complex i've read it to the bit for example the barfin which is a

257
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.200
german equivalent roughly the german equivalent to the icc in america defines custody as

258
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.800
someone who's holding a funds off on behalf of other people is able to

259
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.400
transfer them make payments with that and all this kind of stuff and all

260
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.1000
holds a private key that's eligible to do that and for example in step

261
00:24:15.1000 --> 00:24:21.600
30 that's where you say okay we're splitting off weights between third parties that

262
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.200
need to jointly recover a key for user that's not really that definition so

263
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.800
it's not really clear that's actually a custodial solution that would require regulations so

264
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.400
like by the very definition of financial regulators it may not be but it's

265
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.1000
actually not that clear because it's just basically new land so nobody has actually

266
00:24:43.1000 --> 00:24:49.600
challenged that maybe the regulators weren't even aware that their weighted keys things like

267
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.200
that says the entire entire field is it's not as easy as it gets

268
00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.800
so for us it's like very crucial to find a solution where we say

269
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.400
okay people will be able to recover the key but i wouldn't call that

270
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.1000
a custodian custodial solution because the people does do not hold the funds of

271
00:25:11.1000 --> 00:25:17.600
the user in custody they're not able to to transfer them doing stuff with

272
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.200
that and more importantly they are not able to yeah then they don't have

273
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.800
to do insurance and things like that for it so yeah that's that's the

274
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.400
basic thing i'll sing around it so customian solutions are non-custodials who should be

275
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.1000
it's not the only thing in the real midst as well just mainly for

276
00:25:39.1000 --> 00:25:45.600
us about key recovery that we want to try to solve that's great i

277
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.200
mean i guess i'm curious do you mine heart or marco have kind of

278
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.800
like a similar opinion or reaction extremely relevant and interesting because for example i

279
00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.400
think that for you know for a lot of regulators the fact that a

280
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.1000
user of of a regulated entity actually goes and does something and and loses

281
00:26:07.1000 --> 00:26:13.600
the private key is not sufficient like for the regulator to to just be

282
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.200
fined the the legal obligation you know that that the company has still is

283
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.800
is is a valid payment obligation that the company needs to honor so i

284
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.400
think it's it's not sufficient just to you know like it's it's it's like

285
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.1000
the key management will not remove or will not make go away that legal

286
00:26:35.1000 --> 00:26:41.600
kind of like obligation that some custodial companies have and and that it's it's

287
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.200
it's something that it's very like valid across like all the kind of like

288
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.800
real world assets including currencies and i think you know like at that point

289
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.400
like you realize that somehow for example if if a user of of our

290
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.1000
anchor loses like the private key and you still see the funds you at

291
00:27:03.1000 --> 00:27:09.600
least need to show that you have a process to be able to to

292
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.200
in a way cancel those funds or or or do something with with that

293
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.800
account and then like credit back those tokens to the new or or like

294
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.400
re-key kind of like you know like doing those things it's it helps companies

295
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.1000
like ours to comply with with local regulations that are not aware of like

296
00:27:31.1000 --> 00:27:37.600
what what private keys can do and i think it's like super interesting and

297
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.200
makes companies like ours realize that it's it's a very complex topic that that

298
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.800
is an interesting point you make oh you go first planet okay then that's

299
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.400
interesting okay sorry for that that's an interesting point to raise i mean when

300
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.1000
you when you when you're anchoring an asset you always have the option to

301
00:27:59.1000 --> 00:28:05.600
freeze it and okay it's still still on chain and it's a bit harder

302
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:11.200
to keep track of it but it's still in an automated way you can

303
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.800
can prove that this assets are frozen when you when you for example kind

304
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.400
of take away trust lines and then you can issue the token the assets

305
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.1000
new and that's that's it's somewhat of a cumbersome way it may be easier

306
00:28:27.1000 --> 00:28:33.600
in the future because there are some proposed changes to stellar to to reclaim

307
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.200
assets but this is some way for us for example to to recover recover

308
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:44.800
funds at the moment even if the people lose their their key in their

309
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:50.400
self-custodial solution the problem is actually not from that so we can always do

310
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.1000
that the problem is merely if the user just for example deposits a million

311
00:28:55.1000 --> 00:29:01.600
in excel and then loses this key or her key or the same for

312
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.200
for stablecoin so may not be able up to this process so but the

313
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.800
the interesting idea of just reading the assets and reissuing them to new accounts

314
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.400
is always an option as well that's so you don't have to so that

315
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:23.1000
you just give up the old account when you lose the key just just

316
00:29:23.1000 --> 00:29:29.600
on that briefly obviously you need to flag the asset as being revocable and

317
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:35.200
yeah there's acid types where you work there's configurations where you don't have that

318
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.800
so if you forgot to do that or if you didn't plan for that

319
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.400
then obviously that's not possible either so what we've done in our micro payments

320
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.1000
product actually we used a little bit of a trick there so we are

321
00:29:51.1000 --> 00:29:57.600
co-signing all the transactions that are being done from for the micropens wallets and

322
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.200
we also have a time locked transaction that we issue with each payment meaning

323
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.800
that after a certain period of time the funds will return back to us

324
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.400
if no other transactions have been made meaning that if the user loses a

325
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.1000
key and they flag us they tell us that they did so we will

326
00:30:19.1000 --> 00:30:25.600
simply not co-sign any transactions from that key anymore and then after half a

327
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.200
year i think it's currently the time that we have programmed we can then

328
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.800
recover these funds that means we can issue even lumens to the users from

329
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:42.400
we kind of give out a bit of our liquidity beforehand but in that

330
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.1000
way we can also sort of have a account recovery for accounts that actually

331
00:30:47.1000 --> 00:30:53.600
are lost but the funds will come back to us later after half a

332
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.200
year sort of a sort of a workaround for that issue but isn't co-signing

333
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.800
the definition of it not being as purely self-custodial depends on the type of

334
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:10.400
weight a key has so if you have you know like a minority weight

335
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.1000
and then so i don't know how the regulator regulator sees different types of

336
00:31:15.1000 --> 00:31:21.600
water signatures because that's also depending on the chain obviously i well it's a

337
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.200
hybrid i would say yeah and i think you know just to kind of

338
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.800
respond here so one i wanted to flag christian had mentioned a cap on

339
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.400
stuller which i wanted to name just if anybody's watching yeah cap 35 which

340
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.1000
is the asset clawback cap which is a new proposal so if anyone's interested

341
00:31:43.1000 --> 00:31:49.600
in exploring that further but you know this is really interesting because it still

342
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.200
feels like we're dancing around these areas of kind of how can you stay

343
00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.800
lean and you know i would say kind of do things that allow you

344
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:06.400
as an organization to kind of have a leaner regulatory framework as authentic along

345
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.1000
with things that are more tied to kind of like usability and how do

346
00:32:11.1000 --> 00:32:17.600
we make experiences for consumers to that can keep their information safe but still

347
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.200
provide kind of like non-confusing not overburdened some experiences on the product i mean

348
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.800
do you guys see any other major areas that are kind of i'll say

349
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.400
kind of like dancing around the surface here because i know we're kind of

350
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.1000
talking back and forth about various designs but it feels like there's kind of

351
00:32:39.1000 --> 00:32:45.600
like larger larger themes or larger questions so maybe i i can start because

352
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:51.200
i i i mean we we we've been like also thinking about this the

353
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.800
problem is that if honestly it is true that it removes liability the fact

354
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.400
that you can actually delegate the key management to your users and that like

355
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.1000
fundamentally will remove like regular regulatory like load the problem is that if you

356
00:33:07.1000 --> 00:33:13.600
see what happens in in fintech is that okay regulation is more expensive than

357
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.200
software sure but is it at the top of the list i don't think

358
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.800
so it's like you have software which is cheap and then you have regulation

359
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.400
which is way more expensive and then you have distribution so if you see

360
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.1000
like what's the big expenses that the companies have it's most like distribution a

361
00:33:35.1000 --> 00:33:41.600
customer acquisition cost is what sometimes kills like the unit economics so it's not

362
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:47.200
regulation at all even if it's like super expensive so i think that a

363
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.800
lot of companies realize that okay yeah there's some efficiencies to be made in

364
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.400
in that you know liability that goes away but it's not the entire story

365
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.1000
so you still will need to go and find the users and that's like

366
00:34:03.1000 --> 00:34:09.600
extremely expensive and then sometimes it's even more expensive if you need to make

367
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.200
them learn what like a 12 like 12 word password means or what like

368
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.800
a mechanism to like that it's not intuitive is to recover like the secret

369
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.400
key for your funds so that those things will add costs to that very

370
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.1000
like heavy heavy cost of of customer acquisition or will reduce that the universe

371
00:34:31.1000 --> 00:34:37.600
of people that you can target and i think that's something that from the

372
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:43.200
business perspective it's it's not very positive so so i have a question which

373
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.800
is basically if you had something i mean and this sort of relates specifically

374
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.400
to step 30 which i think is a very clever way to give users

375
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.1000
access to their account without ever having them to touch a password or know

376
00:34:59.1000 --> 00:35:05.600
a secret key or use a backup recovery phase they can basically log into

377
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.200
a stellar account using just their phone number or their email address some proof

378
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.800
of identity right so with a with a solution like that you know well

379
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.400
i guess there's two questions one does a solution like that solve the user

380
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.1000
experience and allow you to create a non-custodial sort of interface or solution that

381
00:35:27.1000 --> 00:35:33.600
doesn't feel that sort of obfuscates the crypto nature of an app from a

382
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.200
user like basically can using something like sub30 make it so that a user

383
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.800
experience for non-custodial wallet is just like a custodial wallet one and two if

384
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.400
it does does it solve the biggest problems or does it only solve some

385
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.1000
of the problems and there are still a lot of problems left over that

386
00:35:55.1000 --> 00:36:01.600
would still make you choose to use a custodial solution i mean maybe i

387
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:07.200
can i can just quickly say that i think it's the final user who

388
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:12.800
will judge those things because at the end of the day for me it's

389
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.400
very intuitive to use a memo id just to identify a final user that

390
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.1000
that actually hasn't been the case for the majority of users of exchanges so

391
00:36:23.1000 --> 00:36:29.600
in a way like something that feels very intuitive in from the kind of

392
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.200
the sign point of view and this is this is true across many different

393
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.800
steps that for me makes a lot of sense but once that they're implemented

394
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.400
like things become trickier and i think that's the only thing that i that

395
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.1000
i could say probably christian can say much more yeah well i think well

396
00:36:51.1000 --> 00:36:57.600
first of all i like the basic idea of study and it's definitely a

397
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.200
valid one we we do have some problems with it by when we want

398
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.800
to to implement it that it's one thing that that's very common among when

399
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:14.400
we implement step ecosystem proposals for those who don't know our standards in the

400
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.1000
stutter system that anchors or people building on it can implement and then everyone

401
00:37:19.1000 --> 00:37:25.600
can use it and it's interoperable between different clients and that is that is

402
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.200
a good thing if you're a client for example there is step six and

403
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.800
set 24 for deposits and withdrawals from anchors and it's super nice so basically

404
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.400
i am as a developer i can go ahead and integrate 10 of them

405
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.1000
in a day and that's super nice for me as a client developer but

406
00:37:47.1000 --> 00:37:53.600
to be honest it's not something i care about as a developer what i

407
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:59.200
care about is optimization of the user flow so for example deposits is the

408
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.800
most crucial thing in our flow ever and if i can increase conversion there

409
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.400
by one percent or by five percent or by ten percent then i would

410
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.1000
do that so it's not it's i'm not fundamentally not interested in getting this

411
00:38:15.1000 --> 00:38:21.600
thing done fast i want to get it done right and currently i can't

412
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.200
do a b testing i can't do client-side validations with steps and withdrawals for

413
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.800
example just just as an example for for seventy grade so this sep integration

414
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.400
as a whole focus on clients getting the job done and that's not what

415
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.1000
we want to do and tab 30 is kind of the same thing it

416
00:38:43.1000 --> 00:38:49.600
has it it automates the entire flow for our clients that we can just

417
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:55.200
do it and then integrate a little integrate a lot with a lot of

418
00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:00.800
other clients who integrate 30 but it's it's not coming from from the perspective

419
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.400
of the client so for example i'll give you an example quite lately quite

420
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.1000
recently i've lost my two-factor authentication and i think was coinbase and it wasn't

421
00:39:11.1000 --> 00:39:17.600
an automated process i had to censor my passport there was a person talking

422
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.200
to me and that's that's fine it's something i would expect as a user

423
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.800
and it encouraged me that this those people do their business right whereas on

424
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:34.400
step 30 if the ease of the flow is like okay my email my

425
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.1000
sms is something i wouldn't fundamentally like as a user to be connected with

426
00:39:39.1000 --> 00:39:45.600
me that i'm just pushing a tech away from losing my entire life saving

427
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:51.200
savings when someone captures my email and my wife quite recently changed her phone

428
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.800
number she doesn't even have access to a whole number anymore so it's like

429
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:02.400
it's it's kind of a weak thing for us and it focuses a lot

430
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.1000
of it's being automated people don't have to hassle with it it's fully integrated

431
00:40:07.1000 --> 00:40:13.600
it's decentralized and that's fundamentally not anything our users care about the basic care

432
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:19.200
you just want to log into the app have an account and never care

433
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.800
about it and for us it would be totally fine if there would be

434
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.400
just a person having an hd wallet in the physical world and it costs

435
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.1000
like thirty dollars or ten dollars or twenty dollars for key recovery because if

436
00:40:35.1000 --> 00:40:41.600
it's below it doesn't make sense anyways if it's above fine or we could

437
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.200
scale it but having an approach that's just focusing on the client side wouldn't

438
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.800
cut it for our users so we would we would have to have have

439
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:58.400
a process that's that's more tied to the user experience and the user doesn't

440
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.1000
want to want to care about that at all i think that just for

441
00:41:03.1000 --> 00:41:09.600
my side i talked a lot so maybe i'll keep it shut now do

442
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:15.200
you do you think that there's like i think i think we've mentioned in

443
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.800
a few points like there's this there's this issue of keys being lost and

444
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.400
then what do people what do users go through to get their keys back

445
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.1000
and then we're talking separately about the products we're developing and all the functionality

446
00:41:31.1000 --> 00:41:37.600
they provide do you think that there's room for custody as a product independent

447
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:43.200
of the products you're developing so maybe i can take this one definitely so

448
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.800
i don't know if this is starting to christian but definitely for us that

449
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:54.400
would be something we desperately want the ecosystem and it would have to be

450
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.1000
a custodian that supports different stellar assets as well and there are wallets that

451
00:41:59.1000 --> 00:42:05.600
support lumens already and insurance that support lumix but to extend that to other

452
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:11.200
assets and maybe even traits to some extent that would be definitely something we

453
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.800
would want to integrate and that's actually what we're actively looking for i would

454
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.400
want to make again the separation between custody and key recovery so we don't

455
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.1000
want to have custody we don't want one want want so traditional custody solutions

456
00:42:27.1000 --> 00:42:33.600
work like they don't expose a private key to anyone but even the users

457
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.200
belonging to that and you send transactions to some kind of signing service to

458
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.800
give it back so we we don't want that we won't always want to

459
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.400
have self custody and the user be in charge of the things with his

460
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.1000
with possession of his or her own key what we want on top is

461
00:42:55.1000 --> 00:43:01.600
key recovery solutions pretty much like sub 30 would offer it conceptually with multiple

462
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:07.200
recovery processes as as weights where not each weight does not have the option

463
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.800
to to trade but i understand where he was coming from it was it

464
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.400
was developed with a different thing in mind it was what was basically developed

465
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.1000
for the use case of not only key recovery it was as well developed

466
00:43:23.1000 --> 00:43:29.600
for sharing keys and all kind of use cases that are required alongside when

467
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:35.200
you're not the only one having access to that key and for that step

468
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.800
study makes a totally perfect job i think it's just like for our purposes

469
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:46.400
but we don't want one all of those features we just basically want at

470
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.1000
any any and in a very seldom selling case someone loses his or her

471
00:43:51.1000 --> 00:43:57.600
key can recover it and for that i think it would be fine if

472
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:03.200
there would be just like two or three maybe notaries or trust trust companies

473
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.800
banks whatever who would provide the service and maybe maybe just a call center

474
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.400
or something like that where people could provide their id's and initiate a recovery

475
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.1000
process so for the users of ours that would it doesn't have to be

476
00:44:19.1000 --> 00:44:25.600
this decentralized solution because most of the users are not crypto maximalists who said

477
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:31.200
everything needs to be decentralized and all these kind of things one thing if

478
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.800
i could make make a proposal that's a bit more technical involved would be

479
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.400
that it's fundamental to stellar to have counterparty risk right so you have to

480
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.1000
establish trust lines to assets or anchors where you say okay i trust those

481
00:44:47.1000 --> 00:44:53.600
people so they say maybe for this you say hello these people are sitting

482
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:59.200
in europe they are they are test by the regulators there that's a bank

483
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.800
bank in europe that hold the assets in custody so that's great i trust

484
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:10.400
those guys i encourage you to do so i established a trust line to

485
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:15.1000
to these stock assets and maybe that would be true for custodians as well

486
00:45:15.1000 --> 00:45:21.600
where you can say hey i'm establishing some kind of custodian custodial trust lines

487
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.200
where i say hey this guy can or girl or entity can hold a

488
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.800
specific weight of my assets so that you have it somehow baked into the

489
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:38.400
protocol level but that's just for the far future for the very near future

490
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.1000
it would be just basically fine to have two or three who are not

491
00:45:43.1000 --> 00:45:49.600
who are who establish trust by being used by many of the enterprises building

492
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:55.200
up on stellar marco and my heart i'm interested if that idea appeals to

493
00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:00.800
the two of you also which idea that basically the idea of there being

494
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.400
sort of trusted custodian professional custodians out there that that you could i think

495
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:11.1000
in general it's it it it fulfills a need i i've seen always stellar

496
00:46:11.1000 --> 00:46:17.600
as a very diverse ecosystem and i think that the problem of like discussing

497
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.200
topics of like one solution versus the other it's like it's not giving the

498
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.800
full picture of what's happening so stellar actually for example i the way i

499
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.400
see it is that at least in the ecosystem we touch there are multiple

500
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.1000
different roles and and and they will like some of them like will require

501
00:46:39.1000 --> 00:46:45.600
something like that and some of them won't so for example like we're thinking

502
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:51.200
imagine a migrant worker that has the need to send over 200 that's not

503
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.800
the same need of the market maker that facilitates like the exchange rates that

504
00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:02.400
those other people benefit from that actually move millions of dollars so so so

505
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.1000
that that makes completely different needs and they're both using stellar so i think

506
00:47:07.1000 --> 00:47:13.600
in in in in one case like shared keys are badly needed and in

507
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:19.200
other ways what what some other projects are are doing which is like completely

508
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.800
abstract in a way and and and you know i why why would a

509
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.400
company like ours would have the liability of the people's funds that's because like

510
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.1000
there aren't a lot of funds maybe you can you can actually because you're

511
00:47:35.1000 --> 00:47:41.600
solving probably you have like you know capital requirements that exceed those people's funds

512
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.200
so like those things will at the end of the day mitigate the risks

513
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.800
and will make you capable of fronting such risks and i think that's that's

514
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:58.400
what that's what i see so in in my mind there's a lot of

515
00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.1000
like sophisticated players in the storage system already in a way that understand like

516
00:48:03.1000 --> 00:48:09.600
how the mechanics work but they aren't yet as many users as i would

517
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.200
like to see i love to see every mexican who's working in a kitchen

518
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:20.800
in new york using a system that touches stellar and and and when you

519
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:26.400
do that it's in my mind a product that completely looks like something that

520
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:31.1000
this community would expect and that's completely something far from from from something like

521
00:48:31.1000 --> 00:48:37.600
except 30 or something like that because they don't want to deal with that

522
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:43.200
it just one like deal with the same thing that they've been doing with

523
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.800
other companies when things fail and and and that's like the market needed that

524
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:54.400
we've seen yeah absolutely and i mean just one point that you made there

525
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.1000
that i do think is really important is that you know even when we're

526
00:48:59.1000 --> 00:49:05.600
thinking about the requirements for just an application oftentimes there's a whole kind of

527
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.200
like broader stack of ecosystem that's required to kind of make that end product

528
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.800
exist and everybody who's in that value chain has kind of differing needs based

529
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.400
on what they're doing so so yeah i think that's fair you know i'd

530
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:27.1000
say well we're in our last 15 minutes here and so you know i

531
00:49:27.1000 --> 00:49:33.600
think we're already kind of doing this but i i would love to drive

532
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.200
the discussion towards kind of identifying gaps or needs or we could also put

533
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.800
these as opportunities within the ecosystem and so maybe i'll just phrase this in

534
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.400
a slightly constraining manner to to kick things off like if you marco meinhard

535
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.1000
and christian could wave a magic wand and have like one new thing exist

536
00:49:55.1000 --> 00:50:01.600
in the stellar ecosystem to support your vision of key management what would that

537
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:07.200
look like like what's the the number one thing that you think would be

538
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.800
super valuable for you whoever wants whoever has a response to that i can

539
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.400
start by by the the already multiplexed accounts that that we've touched before it's

540
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.1000
in general i think that that's something that in my mind is something that

541
00:50:23.1000 --> 00:50:29.600
that was missing and i think i would love to see completely adopted and

542
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.200
the reason is because the way that i feel as a user like the

543
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.800
way that memo ids are used it's kind of like not intuitive and and

544
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:46.400
it's it's it feels like a hack you know like you know every everyone's

545
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.1000
familiar with with a payment app where you can also like include a message

546
00:50:51.1000 --> 00:50:57.600
that travels with with with a payment and so but in this specific case

547
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:03.200
we're like hacking that field that memo field to actually embed information and that

548
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.800
will make the payment to route differently so that became like the the default

549
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.400
way of adopting stellar like for exchanges and i think that you know the

550
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.1000
entire ecosystem accepted that was the way to do it but i think if

551
00:51:19.1000 --> 00:51:25.600
there's a better way to do it which in my in my mind it

552
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:31.200
is multiplexed accounts we should like the sooner the better adopt something like that

553
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:36.800
because you can actually free that field which is important for other use cases

554
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.400
as an example the first implementation we did for bill pay actually encoded information

555
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.1000
about the bill that like the reference of the invoice that that was intended

556
00:51:47.1000 --> 00:51:53.600
to be paid and that was encrypted and sent over the memo so it's

557
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:59.200
like to me those are things that other players may may find like useful

558
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.800
and interesting and will design that way and if we use that field as

559
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:10.400
just an additional feel that together with the with the address we'll actually run

560
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.1000
the payment to to a different like destination i think that that's completely in

561
00:52:15.1000 --> 00:52:21.600
my mind something that shouldn't work that way and and and and you know

562
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:27.200
some evidence is like people make a lot of mistakes when they're like put

563
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.800
assets in and out of exchanges and i think it feels like it's it

564
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.400
would be focusing on on people and companies using custodial wallets but i think

565
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.1000
it's the opposite i think if it's widely adopted it's something that it would

566
00:52:43.1000 --> 00:52:49.600
be there available for everybody and they will like just add a more intuitive

567
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.200
way to just send payments to an address with an amount and that will

568
00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.800
like like satisfy the need of like the routing and and and all the

569
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.400
information that needs to travel with each payment so in my mind that's something

570
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:11.1000
that needs to be adopted obviously discussed before and and and for me that

571
00:53:11.1000 --> 00:53:17.600
that wouldn't be like that so you're you're putting your flag down on the

572
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:23.200
cap 27 planet in the stellar ecosystem and i don't know where i'm going

573
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.800
with this but you're you're squarely on the cap 27 multiplexed account team yeah

574
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:34.400
i think i i think so okay great wonderful meinhard looks like you maybe

575
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.1000
have a thing next great yeah so also cap 27 is really interesting for

576
00:53:39.1000 --> 00:53:45.600
us and that's something unfortunately i can't answer maybe a leak and clarify does

577
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:51.200
it also sort of protects the privacy of the recipients or is it still

578
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:56.800
easy to to like conclude the address that's behind it because that is something

579
00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.400
also we would wish to have that we have not the complete balance of

580
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.1000
all of our clients immediately visible to maybe a sender and so in a

581
00:54:07.1000 --> 00:54:13.600
way not anonymous but partially anonymous transactions at least for the recipient that would

582
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.200
be quite interesting for us and then also something that christian earlier said like

583
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:24.800
a sort of a footed approach or a feathered federated approach for key recovery

584
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:30.400
or even for a coastal resolution that would be definitely quite interesting and then

585
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.1000
you said i should pick one thing but maybe also you can say a

586
00:54:35.1000 --> 00:54:41.600
third thing it would be a sort of regulated entities that are offering this

587
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:47.200
custody as a service and not just key recovery so that's definitely something we

588
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:52.800
would that would solve a lot of problems for us right now because fundamentally

589
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.400
we're not really also because of our consumer's perspective or our user's perspective maximalists

590
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.1000
and and like you have to own your key ultimately we want to offer

591
00:55:03.1000 --> 00:55:09.600
a a transfer service that passes on all the advantages of blockchain or stellar

592
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:15.200
in this case mainly speed and transaction cost and also the transparency and it

593
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.800
doesn't have to be fully self-custodial in our sense like we want to give

594
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:26.400
the user the choice and the user doesn't really care much about that they

595
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.1000
should have a online banking like experience and that we need to know what's

596
00:55:31.1000 --> 00:55:37.600
what's behind it and not also having the need to learn new vocabulary and

597
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:43.200
new approaches so that's like how we want to place our service that makes

598
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.800
sense yeah i i i concur that you know it seems like having along

599
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:54.400
with there being some kind of technical aspects to creating more capabilities around key

600
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.1000
management there's also potentially ecosystem partners that we could bring in that would really

601
00:55:59.1000 --> 00:56:05.600
support this as well so and then lee did you do you know on

602
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.200
cap 27 if it adds any anonymity or i'm not sure if that's something

603
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.800
you're too up to date on so yeah so i can answer that it

604
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:22.400
not not specifically so there's not like a feature cap 27 that that would

605
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:27.1000
make it any more anonymous than using a memo id for a transaction however

606
00:56:27.1000 --> 00:56:33.600
you know the service that's using the services using cap 27 you know could

607
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:39.200
rotate ids for users so they could change the id that a user is

608
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.800
using over time or or you use some other strategies like that that obviously

609
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.400
has some disadvantages if if somebody is treating a cap 27 like a market

610
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.1000
address as a you know an actual address for that user if it's changing

611
00:56:55.1000 --> 00:57:01.600
that could be problematic but i feel like this is this is similar to

612
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:07.200
virtual credit card numbers where you have like a credit card and then you

613
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.800
have like model ones you use for different merchants maybe or different people things

614
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:18.400
like that okay great thank you lee and then christian yeah well there's a

615
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.1000
short time and there's long term so basically we're fundamentally focusing on non-crypto users

616
00:57:23.1000 --> 00:57:29.600
and for non-crypto users convenience is important so there's a reason why why why

617
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:35.200
things like what's app are more popular than things like ebay's because they are

618
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.800
just more convenient and user slower in terms of the more convenient solution all

619
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.400
those but but i think that fundamentally the the key recovery is not should

620
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:51.1000
be easy on the recovery process the recovery process can be hard if i

621
00:57:51.1000 --> 00:57:57.600
lose my wallets like my physical wallets my credit cards in it i'm up

622
00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:03.200
for that that it will be a complicated process to get that all sorted

623
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.800
so that that's fine but setting up my wallet and setting up my my

624
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:14.400
key that you that should be the easy part and for us like the

625
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:19.1000
easiest solution would be just hey on the concretion when you create your account

626
00:58:19.1000 --> 00:58:25.600
on d stock we would just add two or three trusted and reputable public

627
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.200
keys and those people do have some kind of recovery process if i wouldn't

628
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.800
be totally filled with work at d stock i would right now fund a

629
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.400
company started start a startup doing exactly that because there's a need for that

630
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.1000
and like in the long term i could see that i'm better than the

631
00:58:47.1000 --> 00:58:53.600
protocol that's the one thing i said was having trust lines to these custodials

632
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:59.200
pretty much like you have trust lines to to add to assets or anchors

633
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:04.800
would be a nice way maybe even you you could one could think about

634
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:10.400
that when you have an account and it holds assets from multiple different anchors

635
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:15.1000
that you can say that those anchors could jointly recover and cover your key

636
00:59:15.1000 --> 00:59:21.600
by depending on the weights and how many assets you have there as well

637
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:27.200
as cloud acid clawback with cap 35 could put a great job into that

638
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:32.800
but that's like it would be awesome to have it in the protocol embedded

639
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:38.400
but like for our needs it wouldn't even be required for short-term solution would

640
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:43.1000
be just like victory hey let's get two or three trustable notary solicitors something

641
00:59:43.1000 --> 00:59:49.600
like that out there that we all trust and where we say hey let's

642
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:55.200
give each other it doesn't cost me a lot of money so that it

643
00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.800
could be like small small no trees that are just regulated in some country

644
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.400
and you just say put them up put a process behind that that you

645
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.1000
can recover and then i think it would be fine question just to as

646
01:00:11.1000 --> 01:00:17.600
a quick clarification i'm not sure i can exactly actually conceptualize what this would

647
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.200
look like if it was embedded in the protocol and i know it's like

648
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.800
very early stages high level but i mean could you maybe illustrate that a

649
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.400
little bit more like what what you think that would look like basically that

650
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.1000
if you have so the basic idea currently is that you have at public

651
01:00:39.1000 --> 01:00:45.600
keys as a signer and what you could do is when you say hey

652
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.200
we we create trust licenses and take that for custodian but these custodians could

653
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.800
jointly recover your key even though they don't have weights in your public key

654
01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:02.400
could be so basically they they would have these anchors would have a public

655
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.1000
private keeper somewhere on the chain and this public private keeper would have the

656
01:01:07.1000 --> 01:01:13.600
right to recover addresses they would have been added as a signer but you

657
01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.200
don't have to explicitly had them as a signer so basically you create a

658
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.800
trust line to three custodians and then these three custodians could jointly recover your

659
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:30.400
funds but you don't have to add them as a signer so you don't

660
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:35.1000
have this kind of multi-signature thing added to your account gotcha gotcha okay that's

661
01:01:35.1000 --> 01:01:41.600
really useful great well this has been a super interesting and useful discussion and

662
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:47.200
i have to say and i'm sure justin and lee feel the same you

663
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.800
know there's been a lot to take in and digest i really appreciate you

664
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.400
guys sharing your perspective and opinion on this and i have a feeling we're

665
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.1000
we're kind of just kicking this discussion off so we did have one or

666
01:02:03.1000 --> 01:02:09.600
two questions from the audience which i will get up in front of me

667
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:15.200
in just a second oh not that one there we go so i'll just

668
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.800
throw this out to everyone i guess can non-custodial wallet apps connect to a

669
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.400
bank and have a user receive funds in their native currency so that's kind

670
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.1000
of like a non-custodial to custodial payout flow i believe the answer to this

671
01:02:31.1000 --> 01:02:37.600
is yes this is actually a type of payment flow that we facilitate on

672
01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.200
stellar yeah i don't know i think this is the intention of of all

673
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.800
those all the steps that have been adopted so it's like normally an anchor

674
01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.400
that complies with with the existing seps what they would do is basically allow

675
01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.1000
non-custodial solution to be able to get from an anchor services like ours like

676
01:02:59.1000 --> 01:03:05.600
for example a bank informations that they can like go from their own bank

677
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.200
account to to like the bank account that the anchor has and then that

678
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.800
would in exchange you know give the user some some some equivalent of of

679
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:22.400
tokens so that that flow it's it's it's precisely how today all of all

680
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.1000
of the active anchors are are doing yeah you can use lobster or vibrant

681
01:03:27.1000 --> 01:03:33.600
to deposit a number of different anchors because they they already interoperate perfect great

682
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:39.200
thanks guys and then maybe justin this one's for you step 30 and cap

683
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.800
27 both look cool do any of the dev libraries or wallets support these

684
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.400
currently yeah that's an interesting question and part of why i think it was

685
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.1000
good to start to have this discussion cap 27 which marco advocated for earlier

686
01:03:55.1000 --> 01:04:01.600
but has come up a couple of times is called multiplexed accounts it adds

687
01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.200
a new kind of stellar address at the protocol level basically allows a single

688
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.800
stellar account to map to multiple users it was added to protocol 13. however

689
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.400
there's it's kind of like we put in the wiring but we didn't put

690
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.1000
any plugs or switches right like there's no manifestation of this and horizon are

691
01:04:23.1000 --> 01:04:29.600
in the sdks and there's no clear way no clear like methods or standards

692
01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.200
for actually using these mixed accounts so they're there they're just hidden away and

693
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.800
so with those cap 27 specifically in order to really be able to use

694
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.400
it we'd first have to build out the sort of platform layers on top

695
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.1000
of the protocol and then we'd have to start working with people to figure

696
01:04:51.1000 --> 01:04:57.600
out how they would actually use those so cap 27 is possible but not

697
01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.200
really implemented in in any existing applications step 30 on the other hand which

698
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.800
is is not at the protocol level right it basically specifies how you can

699
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:14.400
split key recovery across multiple different servers run by different by different operators right

700
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:19.1000
so instead of having a single key or instead of trying it it relies

701
01:05:19.1000 --> 01:05:25.600
on third parties running these things called recovery servers right now vibrant which is

702
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.200
a a wallet that sort of is facilitates usd savings at the moment mostly

703
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.800
that relies that that uses two recovery servers to implement sub 30 but if

704
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.400
other people in the ecosystem wanted to start implementing sub 30 in their wallets

705
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.1000
this specific key recovery method we would need to as an ecosystem get people

706
01:05:47.1000 --> 01:05:53.600
to run these things recovery servers right recovery servers which are sort of the

707
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:59.200
servers that you delegate to allow a user to access their account if they

708
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.800
lose their key so short answer step 30 is implemented in one wallet and

709
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.400
could be in more if we set up recovery servers that people could use

710
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.1000
and by we i mean the ecosystem as a whole having to add one

711
01:06:15.1000 --> 01:06:21.600
point so this idea that i mentioned about having trust lines for focus for

712
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.200
not custodians but for key recovery people the the major change that it would

713
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.800
add sorry my microphone brother the major change that it would add to the

714
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.400
current solution is that the current solution if you add it as a signer

715
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:43.1000
like in step 30 then you are always getting the other rights as well

716
01:06:43.1000 --> 01:06:49.600
so you can always like jointly transfer funds and stuff like that having these

717
01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.200
kind of recovery service at the protocol level then it would really be just

718
01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.800
okay i'm adding those people and they can they can give me a process

719
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.400
to recover my keys but they can never do payments transactions even if they

720
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.1000
are colluding or jointly hacked those kind of stuff and that would put a

721
01:07:11.1000 --> 01:07:17.600
lot of clearance on the legal side and it would make this the entire

722
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:23.200
setup a lot easier you don't have to store keys online and things like

723
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.800
that so just clarify that yeah i i i i know that we don't

724
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.400
have like a lot of time left but i think it's it's it's interesting

725
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.1000
to keep the conversation going especially because i think the multiplexed accounts can offer

726
01:07:39.1000 --> 01:07:45.600
actually widely adopted some level of of obfuscation to the payments if like people

727
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.200
start using it because as as lee said like people can use them as

728
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.800
as you know like like as dynamic debit card numbers and and it's interesting

729
01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.400
if the entire ecosystem adopts it then like people would be sending money over

730
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.1000
with different m accounts and that will like obvious scale a lot of the

731
01:08:07.1000 --> 01:08:13.600
the information which is really interesting yeah well it sounds like on both fronts

732
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.200
both on kind of step 30s key recovery design and muxed accounts on the

733
01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.800
cop27 side we have a lot of thinking to do i think you know

734
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:30.400
as we kind of said in the beginning this is the beginning of these

735
01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.1000
conversations or maybe the middle i guess they've been going on for a while

736
01:08:35.1000 --> 01:08:41.600
so we'll definitely be continuing them so with that i would say you know

737
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.200
i think it's time to to wrap up the discussion today but i think

738
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:52.800
it's likely we may want to all meet back here in a few months

739
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.400
certainly after meridian and continue this conversation hopefully making some progress in the time

740
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.1000
between so you know again christian mind hard marco we can't thank you enough

741
01:09:03.1000 --> 01:09:09.600
for your time today and for sharing your perspective and i hope everyone has

742
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.800
a wonderful halloween weekend and we'll talk again soon thanks everybody thanks everybody
