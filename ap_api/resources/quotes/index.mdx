import {EndpointsTable} from "@site/src/components/EndpointsTable";

The quote endpoint is used to provide potential trading pairs and exchange rates for a given asset pair. For example, if a user wants to trade their USDC for EUR (or any other Fiat currency), the quote endpoint would provide them with the current exchange rate for that trade.
