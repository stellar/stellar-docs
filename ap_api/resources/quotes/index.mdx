The `/quotes` endpoints are used to fetch exchange rates previously provided to users via the [SEP-38 RFQ API][sep-38] implemented by the Anchor Platform. Quotes are commitments to trade an off-chain asset such as fiat euro for an on-chain asset such as USDC, or vice-versa, at a specified rate. Quotes are only valid for a specified period of time.

For each request for a quote from a client application such as a wallet or exchange, the Anchor Platform makes a `GET /rate` request to the business server. The business then returns the exchange rate, quote expiration, and any additional fees for facilitating the transaction back to the Anchor Platform.

In the Anchor Platform today, quotes are only relevant for businesses offering cross-border payment services via SEP-31.
