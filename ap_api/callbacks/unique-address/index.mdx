Unique Address is a unique Stellar address + memo pair that is assigned to a new [SEP-31] transaction.

When creating SEP-31 transaction, a destination address/memo pair is generated automatically by the Anchor Platform. When monitoring Stellar chain (e.g. via Payment Observer), this unique address is used to map on-chain transfers to the SEP transaction.

In addition, it's possible to define your own address generator (e.g. you can delegate it to your custodial service). This callback is used to generate such addresses.
