## Get fees



The Platform will make this request to the anchor every time a transaction is initiated by a client application
without a `quote_id`.

The Anchor must ensure that the sending and receiving customers specified in the request meet the KYC requirements
necessary to partake in the transaction described in the request.

The anchor must return the fee it will charge for the transaction.

In the future, this endpoint may be used to provide estimated fees to client applications prior to initiating transactions.
When this change is made, the request schema will be adapted to support the use case.
