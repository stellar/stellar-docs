## Retrieve Fees



The Platform will make this request to the anchor every time a transaction is initiated by a client application
without a `quote_id`.

The Anchor must ensure that the sending and receiving customers specified in the request meet the KYC requirements
necessary to partake in the transaction described in the request.

The anchor must return the fee it will charge for the transaction.

In the future, this endpoint may be used to provide estimated fees to client applications prior to initiating transactions.
When this change is made, the request schema will be adapted to support the use case.

Unprocessable Entity. This status should be returned when the anchor understood the request but cannot 
return a success response. An example for when this response code would be appropriate is if the sender 
and/or receiver is not permitted to initiate a transaction with the specified amounts. In these cases, 
the Platform will respond to the client application's request with a `400 Bad Request` and include the 
error message provided by the anchor in the response body.
