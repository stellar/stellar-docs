guess hear me? Okay,
&gt;&gt; perfect.
&gt;&gt; perfect.
&gt;&gt; All right. So yeah, so like at a high
&gt;&gt; All right. So yeah, so like at a high

first what is actually in scope uh for

problem. So like Toma was explaining

earlier there there's actually uh two
earlier there there's actually uh two
earlier there there's actually uh two
types of entries that um that u that
types of entries that um that u that
types of entries that um that u that
were corrupted.
were corrupted.
were corrupted.
Um they both started in the same way
Um they both started in the same way
Um they both started in the same way
where they basically entries got moved
where they basically entries got moved
where they basically entries got moved
from the live ledger state into the
from the live ledger state into the
from the live ledger state into the
archive and during that process uh
archive and during that process uh
archive and during that process uh
entries got corrupted
entries got corrupted
entries got corrupted
and then after that some of those got
and then after that some of those got
and then after that some of those got
restored and uh at that point they were
restored and uh at that point they were
restored and uh at that point they were
restored for all sorts of purpose. It
restored for all sorts of purpose. It
restored for all sorts of purpose. It
could be uh for just uh reading them
could be uh for just uh reading them
could be uh for just uh reading them
like a uh you know a lot of entries on
like a uh you know a lot of entries on
like a uh you know a lot of entries on
on in Sorban are just accessed uh for
on in Sorban are just accessed uh for
on in Sorban are just accessed uh for
for reads uh like a WAM for example is

Um and uh yeah but what what the cap is
Um and uh yeah but what what the cap is
Um and uh yeah but what what the cap is
uh is uh putting in scope is the only
uh is uh putting in scope is the only
uh is uh putting in scope is the only
the first category of of entry. So
the first category of of entry. So
the first category of of entry. So
basically the ones that were moved into
basically the ones that were moved into
basically the ones that were moved into
the archived and kind of stayed there.
the archived and kind of stayed there.
the archived and kind of stayed there.
Um and um
Um and um
Um and um
the uh the solution as part of this is
the uh the solution as part of this is
the uh the solution as part of this is
uh is uh is to basically go and
uh is uh is to basically go and
uh is uh is to basically go and
take the value uh that was supposed to
take the value uh that was supposed to
take the value uh that was supposed to
be in the archive uh and then override
be in the archive uh and then override
be in the archive uh and then override
the uh the archive with that expected
the uh the archive with that expected
the uh the archive with that expected
value. So the fix itself sounds fairly
value. So the fix itself sounds fairly
value. So the fix itself sounds fairly
fairly simple. U because it is the u the
fairly simple. U because it is the u the
fairly simple. U because it is the u the
bit the the bit of a challenging part
bit the the bit of a challenging part
bit the the bit of a challenging part
here is um how can you all of you guys
here is um how can you all of you guys
here is um how can you all of you guys
can trust us that this is the right list
can trust us that this is the right list
can trust us that this is the right list
and uh there's actually quite a bit of
and uh there's actually quite a bit of
and uh there's actually quite a bit of
work that went into this um in in the
work that went into this um in in the
work that went into this um in in the
the cap. So the there's a full list of
the cap. So the there's a full list of
the cap. So the there's a full list of
um of basically of uh in a CSV file uh
um of basically of uh in a CSV file uh
um of basically of uh in a CSV file uh
that you will find uh where you will see
that you will find uh where you will see
that you will find uh where you will see
for each of those entries that end up in
for each of those entries that end up in
for each of those entries that end up in
the archive we have the uh ledger number
the archive we have the uh ledger number
the archive we have the uh ledger number
where uh when the um the entry got moved
where uh when the um the entry got moved
where uh when the um the entry got moved
into the archive corrupted like I said.
into the archive corrupted like I said.
into the archive corrupted like I said.
So in that case we actually have in this
So in that case we actually have in this
So in that case we actually have in this
CSV the the value of the of the entry as
CSV the the value of the of the entry as
CSV the the value of the of the entry as
it was at the moment it was about to get
it was at the moment it was about to get
it was at the moment it was about to get
moved. And then we also have in the same
moved. And then we also have in the same
moved. And then we also have in the same
row uh like the value that uh of the
row uh like the value that uh of the
row uh like the value that uh of the
corrupted u entry and uh and then what
corrupted u entry and uh and then what
corrupted u entry and uh and then what
happens when we uh when we are going to
happens when we uh when we are going to
happens when we uh when we are going to
um u follow the this cap right is the um
um u follow the this cap right is the um
um u follow the this cap right is the um
core is going to to scan those entries

Um then the uh the value will get um

that's kind of like like the uh the
that's kind of like like the uh the
