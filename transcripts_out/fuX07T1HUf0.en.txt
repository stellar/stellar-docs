Um I guess the purpose of today's

to revisit the caps that we have
to revisit the caps that we have

70. So maybe if parent is
70. So maybe if parent is
70. So maybe if parent is
here. Yeah. Maybe you could talk about
here. Yeah. Maybe you could talk about
here. Yeah. Maybe you could talk about
cap 70 because it's completely new and
cap 70 because it's completely new and
cap 70 because it's completely new and
then we could I don't know I guess
then we could I don't know I guess
then we could I don't know I guess
quickly recap other caps
quickly recap other caps
quickly recap other caps
and there any questions um concerning

Cool. Uh yeah that sounds good. Um so I
Cool. Uh yeah that sounds good. Um so I
Cool. Uh yeah that sounds good. Um so I
guess getting started with cap 70. Uh
guess getting started with cap 70. Uh
guess getting started with cap 70. Uh
this one is a recent addition to
this one is a recent addition to
this one is a recent addition to
protocol 23 um but it's fairly uh small
protocol 23 um but it's fairly uh small
protocol 23 um but it's fairly uh small
and straightforward. And so essentially
and straightforward. And so essentially
and straightforward. And so essentially
what this does is it introduces a couple
what this does is it introduces a couple
what this does is it introduces a couple
of new uh network config settings that
of new uh network config settings that
of new uh network config settings that
control um some of the timing parameters
control um some of the timing parameters
control um some of the timing parameters
around consensus. Uh so essentially uh
around consensus. Uh so essentially uh
around consensus. Uh so essentially uh
today um like during consensus there's a
today um like during consensus there's a
today um like during consensus there's a
couple of hard-coded values such as the
couple of hard-coded values such as the
couple of hard-coded values such as the
block of the ledge or the length of the
block of the ledge or the length of the
block of the ledge or the length of the
ledger being 5 seconds as well as some
ledger being 5 seconds as well as some
ledger being 5 seconds as well as some
of the uh more nitty-gritty details on
of the uh more nitty-gritty details on
of the uh more nitty-gritty details on
consensus as to like how long um nodes
consensus as to like how long um nodes
consensus as to like how long um nodes
wait for certain rounds like timeouts uh
wait for certain rounds like timeouts uh
wait for certain rounds like timeouts uh
between certain uh consensus rounds and
between certain uh consensus rounds and
between certain uh consensus rounds and
things like this. And so essentially
things like this. And so essentially
things like this. And so essentially
this cap doesn't actually change
this cap doesn't actually change
this cap doesn't actually change
anything um but it just allows us uh to
anything um but it just allows us uh to
anything um but it just allows us uh to
change these values in the future. So
change these values in the future. So
change these values in the future. So
for instance today stellar core all the
for instance today stellar core all the
for instance today stellar core all the
nodes are hardcoded to have a 5-second
nodes are hardcoded to have a 5-second
nodes are hardcoded to have a 5-second
ledger time. Um but with this cap it
ledger time. Um but with this cap it
ledger time. Um but with this cap it
allows that to be dynamic and
allows that to be dynamic and
allows that to be dynamic and
configurable. And so kind of the uh the
configurable. And so kind of the uh the
configurable. And so kind of the uh the
motivation behind this is that as we uh
motivation behind this is that as we uh
motivation behind this is that as we uh
want to move towards you know higher
want to move towards you know higher
want to move towards you know higher
throughput and lower block times um
throughput and lower block times um
throughput and lower block times um
making you know large jumps is
making you know large jumps is
making you know large jumps is
difficult. Going from 5-second blocks to
difficult. Going from 5-second blocks to
difficult. Going from 5-second blocks to
2 and 1/2 second blocks is very very
2 and 1/2 second blocks is very very
2 and 1/2 second blocks is very very
challenging. Um so the goal with this is
challenging. Um so the goal with this is
challenging. Um so the goal with this is
to allow us to kind of make small
to allow us to kind of make small
to allow us to kind of make small
incremental changes uh via SLPs where
incremental changes uh via SLPs where
incremental changes uh via SLPs where
you know to get to that goal of 2 and a
you know to get to that goal of 2 and a
you know to get to that goal of 2 and a
half seconds or whatever it may be uh
half seconds or whatever it may be uh
half seconds or whatever it may be uh
you know we start uh by just trimming
you know we start uh by just trimming
you know we start uh by just trimming
off like one or 200 millconds at a time
off like one or 200 millconds at a time
off like one or 200 millconds at a time
and over time we'll get there and so
and over time we'll get there and so
and over time we'll get there and so
essentially this cap introduces all
essentially this cap introduces all
essentially this cap introduces all
these new config settings um but the
these new config settings um but the
these new config settings um but the
default values are the exact same values
default values are the exact same values
default values are the exact same values
that are currently hardcoded into core
that are currently hardcoded into core
that are currently hardcoded into core
and so cap 70 will have no noticeable
and so cap 70 will have no noticeable
and so cap 70 will have no noticeable
change um when it's uh initially

implemented but just opens the door to
implemented but just opens the door to

have more configurability and hopefully
have more configurability and hopefully
have more configurability and hopefully
tighter iteration cycles as we go to
tighter iteration cycles as we go to
tighter iteration cycles as we go to
improve consensus and nomination timing
improve consensus and nomination timing
improve consensus and nomination timing
in the
in the
in the
future. Yeah. So, I think it's uh pretty
future. Yeah. So, I think it's uh pretty
future. Yeah. So, I think it's uh pretty
straightforward and probably um not
straightforward and probably um not
straightforward and probably um not
super controversial, but if anyone has
super controversial, but if anyone has
super controversial, but if anyone has
any questions or wants to talk about,
any questions or wants to talk about,
any questions or wants to talk about,
you know, feel free.
Um yes have a small question which I
Um yes have a small question which I
kind of already asked in the but
kind of already asked in the but
kind of already asked in the but
basically
basically
basically
um is it
um is it
um is it
possible like for example for seran
possible like for example for seran
possible like for example for seran
network settings it is relatively easy
network settings it is relatively easy
network settings it is relatively easy
to understand what every settings means
to understand what every settings means
to understand what every settings means
and you know if you're for example
and you know if you're for example
and you know if you're for example
increasing the prov limit for
increasing the prov limit for
increasing the prov limit for
instruction like 100x it is kind of easy
instruction like 100x it is kind of easy
instruction like 100x it is kind of easy
to spot that it's probably not going to
to spot that it's probably not going to
to spot that it's probably not going to
work because we will take 100 times more
work because we will take 100 times more
work because we will take 100 times more
time to close the ledger. So my question
time to close the ledger. So my question
time to close the ledger. So my question
here is
here is
here is
uh how risky is this set of parameters?
uh how risky is this set of parameters?
uh how risky is this set of parameters?
Is it possible to um accidentally uh v
Is it possible to um accidentally uh v
Is it possible to um accidentally uh v
for an upgrade that breaks the network
for an upgrade that breaks the network
for an upgrade that breaks the network
in an unintuitive way because we're kind
in an unintuitive way because we're kind
in an unintuitive way because we're kind
of uh altering the uh consensus
of uh altering the uh consensus
of uh altering the uh consensus
algorithm which on its own is used to
algorithm which on its own is used to
algorithm which on its own is used to
uh well do everything on the network
uh well do everything on the network
uh well do everything on the network
such as upgrades. So unbreaking the
such as upgrades. So unbreaking the
such as upgrades. So unbreaking the
network would be tricky. So you know how
network would be tricky. So you know how
network would be tricky. So you know how
risky it is to break the network.
risky it is to break the network.
risky it is to break the network.
Yeah. So I I do agree with you. Uh these
Yeah. So I I do agree with you. Uh these
Yeah. So I I do agree with you. Uh these
are pretty kind of uh you know low-level
are pretty kind of uh you know low-level
are pretty kind of uh you know low-level
technical settings. Um I think kind of
technical settings. Um I think kind of
technical settings. Um I think kind of
the reason uh it makes sense from a
the reason uh it makes sense from a
the reason uh it makes sense from a
technical standpoint to be config
technical standpoint to be config
technical standpoint to be config
settings is that these are things that
settings is that these are things that
settings is that these are things that
we want to change often and kind of
we want to change often and kind of
we want to change often and kind of
slowly over time um to you know make
slowly over time um to you know make
slowly over time um to you know make
small incremental progress and all the
small incremental progress and all the
small incremental progress and all the
nodes have to agree on them. So it makes
nodes have to agree on them. So it makes
nodes have to agree on them. So it makes
sense to be conflict setting but they
sense to be conflict setting but they
sense to be conflict setting but they
definitely are difficult to understand.
definitely are difficult to understand.
definitely are difficult to understand.
And so I think as far as validation um
And so I think as far as validation um
And so I think as far as validation um
pretty much the only tool that we have
pretty much the only tool that we have
pretty much the only tool that we have
is supercluster and kind of simulating
is supercluster and kind of simulating
is supercluster and kind of simulating
the network and seeing the effect these
the network and seeing the effect these
the network and seeing the effect these
values will have. Um and they definitely
values will have. Um and they definitely
values will have. Um and they definitely
have effects that are sometimes not
have effects that are sometimes not
have effects that are sometimes not
super intuitive. And so I think what we
super intuitive. And so I think what we
super intuitive. And so I think what we
might want to do is uh at the uh
might want to do is uh at the uh
might want to do is uh at the uh
especially when we just launched these
especially when we just launched these
especially when we just launched these
features um is to put tight bounds onto
features um is to put tight bounds onto
features um is to put tight bounds onto
the acceptable values. Uh so for
the acceptable values. Uh so for
the acceptable values. Uh so for
instance like if today um the default
instance like if today um the default
instance like if today um the default
value for you know electric close timer
value for you know electric close timer
value for you know electric close timer
is 500 or 5,000 milliseconds or 5
is 500 or 5,000 milliseconds or 5
is 500 or 5,000 milliseconds or 5
seconds uh if you were to change that to
seconds uh if you were to change that to
seconds uh if you were to change that to
50 milliseconds uh the network uh that
50 milliseconds uh the network uh that
50 milliseconds uh the network uh that
bad things would happen um and uh the
bad things would happen um and uh the
bad things would happen um and uh the
network would be very unstable and so
network would be very unstable and so
network would be very unstable and so
perhaps uh what we can do is um given
perhaps uh what we can do is um given
perhaps uh what we can do is um given
that at least my thinking the goal with
that at least my thinking the goal with
that at least my thinking the goal with
this gap is to make small incre
this gap is to make small incre
this gap is to make small incre
improvements uh we could have very tight
improvements uh we could have very tight
improvements uh we could have very tight
bounds um just at the uh you
bounds um just at the uh you
bounds um just at the uh you
implementation uh level. Um and so say
implementation uh level. Um and so say
implementation uh level. Um and so say
for instance like in protocol 23 uh we
for instance like in protocol 23 uh we
for instance like in protocol 23 uh we
could say that the lower bound on the uh
could say that the lower bound on the uh
could say that the lower bound on the uh
ledger close time is like four 4 seconds
ledger close time is like four 4 seconds
ledger close time is like four 4 seconds
or maybe like 3 and a half or like that.
or maybe like 3 and a half or like that.
or maybe like 3 and a half or like that.
And so worst case you know if someone
And so worst case you know if someone
And so worst case you know if someone
was to propose like a 50 millisecond
was to propose like a 50 millisecond
was to propose like a 50 millisecond
change it just wouldn't go through. And
change it just wouldn't go through. And
change it just wouldn't go through. And
you know um even like these lower bounds
you know um even like these lower bounds
you know um even like these lower bounds
I think these would be like kind of uh
I think these would be like kind of uh
I think these would be like kind of uh
guesses at this point uh because there's
guesses at this point uh because there's
guesses at this point uh because there's
still lots of testing um and validity
still lots of testing um and validity
still lots of testing um and validity
checking that needs to be done on these
checking that needs to be done on these
checking that needs to be done on these
values. But I think like you know um if
values. But I think like you know um if
values. But I think like you know um if
you go from 5 seconds to 4 seconds that
you go from 5 seconds to 4 seconds that
you go from 5 seconds to 4 seconds that
might still cause some network
might still cause some network
might still cause some network
instability. But I don't think you would
instability. But I don't think you would
instability. But I don't think you would
break the network um in the same way
break the network um in the same way
break the network um in the same way
that you would if you went from like you
that you would if you went from like you
that you would if you went from like you
know 5 seconds to 50 milliseconds. Um
know 5 seconds to 50 milliseconds. Um
know 5 seconds to 50 milliseconds. Um
and so uh would something like that
and so uh would something like that
and so uh would something like that
maybe some tighter bounds uh alleviate
maybe some tighter bounds uh alleviate
maybe some tighter bounds uh alleviate
some of your concerns?
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Um this I
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Um this I
still feel it might be a bit scary but
still feel it might be a bit scary but
still feel it might be a bit scary but
yeah I guess we can try make sure that

yeah I guess we can try make sure that
maybe one

thing I thought of when you were talking

Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I mean

might be a little tricky.
I agree like the uh yeah having bounds
I agree like the uh yeah having bounds

Yeah. And I think that's uh one of the

uh lowering the block time is down is

I'd imagine many many things would break

I have more questions but the only

Um, but I think like to Dimma's point,
Um, but I think like to Dimma's point,
Um, but I think like to Dimma's point,
you know, like a protocol 23 package,
you know, like a protocol 23 package,

might be what uh, what's interesting um,
might be what uh, what's interesting um,
might be what uh, what's interesting um,
is that, you know, even though
is that, you know, even though
is that, you know, even though
technically it's a config setting, what

we might do is that we can only um, you
we might do is that we can only um, you
we might do is that we can only um, you
know, even though the bounds are um, uh,

point. Um and then like uh say the bound
point. Um and then like uh say the bound
like the lower bound is 4 seconds in P23
like the lower bound is 4 seconds in P23
like the lower bound is 4 seconds in P23
and then uh the lower bound in P24 could
and then uh the lower bound in P24 could
and then uh the lower bound in P24 could
be like 3 seconds. And so you don't
be like 3 seconds. And so you don't
be like 3 seconds. And so you don't
change the actual value um on the P23 to
change the actual value um on the P23 to
change the actual value um on the P23 to
P24 upgrade. Uh but you chose you change
P24 upgrade. Uh but you chose you change

how low the value can be. And I think
how low the value can be. And I think
how low the value can be. And I think
that might be the uh the best way to

here but that's lots of small pieces

Um yeah that's pretty much it.
Um yeah that's pretty much it.
Um right any questions from this camp or

before we proer caps are no changes.
I guess there are no questions. Um
I guess there are no questions. Um
