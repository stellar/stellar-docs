So, this is what we are trying to do.
So, this is what we are trying to do.
So, this is what we are trying to do.
So, you deposit your assets into the
So, you deposit your assets into the
So, you deposit your assets into the
world. The world tries to

utilize your assets in the best way and
utilize your assets in the best way and
utilize your assets in the best way and
earn some interest and you will get

do
um transitions between shares and
um transitions between shares and
um transitions between shares and

So how do we calculate shares and
So how do we calculate shares and
assets? So let's say you deposit your
assets? So let's say you deposit your
assets? So let's say you deposit your
assets and you will get shares. The
assets and you will get shares. The
assets and you will get shares. The
basic formula for that would be uh we
basic formula for that would be uh we
basic formula for that would be uh we
will multiply the deposit assets by the
will multiply the deposit assets by the
will multiply the deposit assets by the
total shares currently in the world and
total shares currently in the world and
total shares currently in the world and
then we divide the this result by total
then we divide the this result by total
then we divide the this result by total
assets in the world and that whole
assets in the world and that whole
assets in the world and that whole
result will be your shares.
result will be your shares.
result will be your shares.
This will be very important. Uh so now
This will be very important. Uh so now
This will be very important. Uh so now
that I'm going to do some basic math uh
that I'm going to do some basic math uh
that I'm going to do some basic math uh
but it's very basic so don't be scared.
but it's very basic so don't be scared.

Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the

Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the
vault.

So for deposit assets it's th uh 100
So for deposit assets it's th uh 100
So for deposit assets it's th uh 100
total shares it's again 100 and total
total shares it's again 100 and total
total shares it's again 100 and total
assets is uh 100.
assets is uh 100.
assets is uh 100.
So let's say 10% yield is earned
So let's say 10% yield is earned
So let's say 10% yield is earned
and now the asset amount per share has
and now the asset amount per share has
and now the asset amount per share has
increased. So previously one asset
increased. So previously one asset
increased. So previously one asset
was um corresponding to one share but
was um corresponding to one share but
was um corresponding to one share but
right now
right now
right now
since the total shares have not changed
since the total shares have not changed
since the total shares have not changed
it only the interest rate increase the
it only the interest rate increase the
it only the interest rate increase the
total asset amount
total asset amount

in the world
then this ratio should change right uh
then this ratio should change right uh
then this ratio should change right uh
right now if you provide one share you
right now if you provide one share you
right now if you provide one share you
will get 1.1 1 asset in return because
will get 1.1 1 asset in return because
will get 1.1 1 asset in return because
one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say
one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say
one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say
Bob uh deposits 300 USC
Bob uh deposits 300 USC
Bob uh deposits 300 USC
and we do this calculation and Bob will
and we do this calculation and Bob will
and we do this calculation and Bob will
get will get 272.73
shares in return. So it's not one to one
shares in return. So it's not one to one
uh mapping as in the case for Alice
uh mapping as in the case for Alice
uh mapping as in the case for Alice
because there was 10%. And this is still
because there was 10%. And this is still
because there was 10%. And this is still
fine because uh if you multiply the
fine because uh if you multiply the
fine because uh if you multiply the
shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is
shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is
shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is
still fair.
still fair.
still fair.
And let's say another 10% of uh interest
And let's say another 10% of uh interest
And let's say another 10% of uh interest
has happened and now Charlie deposits
has happened and now Charlie deposits
has happened and now Charlie deposits
200 and the amount for shares would be

or depositing depo depositing we are
or depositing depo depositing we are
or depositing depo depositing we are
rounding down your number of shares so
rounding down your number of shares so
rounding down your number of shares so
that you'll get slightly fewer shares
that you'll get slightly fewer shares
that you'll get slightly fewer shares
than the exact ratio. The reason is

not deposit. So since it's not deposit,
not deposit. So since it's not deposit,
not deposit. So since it's not deposit,
it only increases the total asset amount
it only increases the total asset amount
it only increases the total asset amount
but not the shares. So it's basically
but not the shares. So it's basically

I'm just giving away this money to the
I'm just giving away this money to the
I'm just giving away this money to the

vault and I'm not expecting any shares
in return. Why would someone do this?
in return. Why would someone do this?
in return. Why would someone do this?
You will see the reason. Um and if you
You will see the reason. Um and if you
You will see the reason. Um and if you
convert the USDC to stroops uh you know
convert the USDC to stroops uh you know
convert the USDC to stroops uh you know
there are seven decimal places in
there are seven decimal places in
there are seven decimal places in
stellar so we added after 10,000 seven
stellar so we added after 10,000 seven
stellar so we added after 10,000 seven
more u zeros and then we added the
more u zeros and then we added the
more u zeros and then we added the
previous ones troop you will have this
previous ones troop you will have this
previous ones troop you will have this
number for total assets and now alice
number for total assets and now alice
number for total assets and now alice
deposits
deposits
deposits
thousands troops so if you divide
thousands troops so if you divide
thousands troops so if you divide
thousands troops to this total asset
thousands troops to this total asset
thousands troops to this total asset
amount

you will get something really small like
you will get something really small like
you will get something really small like
0.00001
0.00001
0.00001
or something like that and this will be
or something like that and this will be
or something like that and this will be
ultimately zero because of the rounding
ultimately zero because of the rounding
ultimately zero because of the rounding
down that I explained previously. So
down that I explained previously. So
down that I explained previously. So
basically Alice deposited some money
basically Alice deposited some money
basically Alice deposited some money
which which was non zero. It was
which which was non zero. It was
which which was non zero. It was
thousands troops but in return she got
thousands troops but in return she got
thousands troops but in return she got
zero shares and if the attacker redeems
zero shares and if the attacker redeems
zero shares and if the attacker redeems
their shares they will get all the money
their shares they will get all the money
their shares they will get all the money
basically stealing Alice's uh troops.
basically stealing Alice's uh troops.
basically stealing Alice's uh troops.
The other scenario would be in here. So
The other scenario would be in here. So
The other scenario would be in here. So
let's say again this the first two
let's say again this the first two
let's say again this the first two
scenario are the same attacker deposited
scenario are the same attacker deposited
scenario are the same attacker deposited
one troop and then they donated 1 thou
one troop and then they donated 1 thou
one troop and then they donated 1 thou
10,000 USDC
10,000 USDC
10,000 USDC
and after that say Alice deposited
and after that say Alice deposited
and after that say Alice deposited
10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the
10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the
10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the
total assets right but only one stroop
total assets right but only one stroop
total assets right but only one stroop
short of it so if you do the calculation
short of it so if you do the calculation
short of it so if you do the calculation
it will be somewhat like 0.99999
it will be somewhat like 0.99999
it will be somewhat like 0.99999
but since we don't have any precision
but since we don't have any precision
but since we don't have any precision
for the decimal points, it will again be
for the decimal points, it will again be
for the decimal points, it will again be
round down to zero and attacker would
round down to zero and attacker would
round down to zero and attacker would
steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD
steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD
steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD
due to this rounding down behavior.
due to this rounding down behavior.
due to this rounding down behavior.
So this is the inflation attack. This is

straightforward calculation we also add
straightforward calculation we also add

an offset to the power of 10
an offset to the power of 10
an offset to the power of 10
and it will be something like this. So
and it will be something like this. So
and it will be something like this. So
if you deposit one stroop instead of one
if you deposit one stroop instead of one
if you deposit one stroop instead of one
share you will get
share you will get
share you will get
this amount of shares. Uh this is up to
this amount of shares. Uh this is up to
this amount of shares. Uh this is up to
your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3
your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3
your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will
4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will
4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will
have nine for the offset and you will
have nine for the offset and you will
have nine for the offset and you will
get this amount of shares
get this amount of shares
get this amount of shares
and let's say for the same attack the
and let's say for the same attack the
and let's say for the same attack the
attacker then donates
attacker then donates
attacker then donates
10,000 USDC
10,000 USDC
10,000 USDC
uh they won't get any shares because
uh they won't get any shares because
uh they won't get any shares because
it's a donation then Alice would deposit
it's a donation then Alice would deposit
it's a donation then Alice would deposit
10,000 strooss it would have been this
10,000 strooss it would have been this
10,000 strooss it would have been this
small amount previously if we didn't use
small amount previously if we didn't use
small amount previously if we didn't use
decimal offset but since we are using

the default one is claim based. So um
the default one is claim based. So um
the default one is claim based. So um
you can think of it like I'm from Turkey
you can think of it like I'm from Turkey
you can think of it like I'm from Turkey
and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this
and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this
and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this
RWA setting maybe uh the residency is an

basically you can uh replace the stack
basically you can uh replace the stack
basically you can uh replace the stack

So what do we provide for the default
So what do we provide for the default

we limited the topics by at most 15. We

you wrote another logic in the scan
you wrote another logic in the scan
