Okay let's go ahead and get started.Thank you everyone for joining today's..Stellar development foundation quarterly.Call .We are very excited to have you all on.Today .We've got an exciting agenda a lot to.Cover because SDF and Stellar really had.A big second quarter of 2020.Danel dixon our ceo is going to kick.Things off in a moment with an.Announcement about our work with.A fortune 15 company and to also share.Some other highlights and achievements.We've worked towards in q2.And she'll be joined by bill bar height.Ceo of abra about the exciting work and.Products that abra's been working on and.That are powered by Stellar.And justin rice our head of ecosystem at.Sdf he's going to provide some details.On our technology updates.And our overall network performance as.Well as share some more about our.Terrible charitable giving program that.We just announced with our ecosystem.Partner loomanthropy.And then our general counsel candace.Kelly is going to touch on sdf's growing.Visibility and our public engagement.Activities and the work we've been doing.To increase our involvement in the.Policy dialogue.So like I said a lot to cover and of.Course we'll leave some time at the end.To answer any questions you have about.Today's presentation.Or the report that you should have all.Received just shortly before the call.Started.And you can submit questions throughout.The presentation in the chat box in the.In the chat box marked q a in the left.Hand corner so with that.I'm really excited to turn it over to.Our ceo and executive director danielle.Dixon.For the moment we've all been waiting.For danielle.Thank you lauren it's so awesome to be.Here thanks everyone for joining the.Call today.I just really love these quarterly calls.I actually really love going back and.Reflecting on the quarter that we just.Had so.I'm really excited to be here and thank.You guys for joining us so let's get.First I'm super excited to announce and.To highlight. that in q2 we finalized sellers.Integration into samsung's blockchain.Key store.So over the last several months we've.Been working closely with samsung to.Integrate Stellar and I'm happy to.Announce that Stellar end users are now.Able to securely store private keys.On select samsung galaxy smartphones.I've been saying this a lot lately but.Key management is an.Important part of how we will drive our.Technology into the mainstream.And samsung provides a key management.Solution that is user friendly.And will ultimately drive greater.Adoption of blockchain technology.Because it's so easy to use it's.Designed with the user in mind which is.Just a really really important thing.That we need to continually focus on in.Blockchain.This integration is also significant.Development for the great ecosystem of.Applications built on our network.It's going to allow Stellar ecosystem.Developers to create blockchain apps and.Services for samsung galaxy smartphones.In addition to existing Stellar-based.Products and applications.It just opens up a whole new network of.Users that can benefit from the combined.Innovation of Stellar and samsung.We already have four Stellar based.Businesses adopting the.The required sdks to make their.Applications available in the key store.This is including d stock and satoshi.Pay.Lightmint and nodal but our work with.Samsung isn't going to stop here.We're committed to collaborating to.Expand and improve the blockchain.Ecosystem experience for consumers.By working with developers who built who.Have built on Stellar network and.Incorporated the appropriate sdks into.Their applications to utilize.The samsung blockchain keystore and the.Integration into their applications.So together we'll partner in an ongoing.Effort to recruit.Onboard and support developers in the.Stellar ecosystem.It's just the beginning as we work.Together to empower more developers and.Users to leverage blockchain in the.Capabilities presented by this.Integration.We're really proud of this development.And it's reflective of the growth we're.Seeing in all aspects of our business.So it's clear that 2020 has been a year.Unlike any others across industries.We've all had to adapt to a new normal. fortunately for SDF and for Stellar.We're continuing to grow and thrive.Even during these challenging times.We've grown our capacity.And our team we've brought exciting new.Leaders onto our board.And we've made strategic advances on.Every core tenet of our roadmap to.Creating.Equitable access to the global financial.System.And I'm just so proud of our work in.These areas so I want to just take you.Through the three pillars of our.Strategy. first we've talked about our.Requirement that we foster sustainable.Use cases.And so we're growing our anchor.Footprint in regions around the world.We're building product and we're making.Strategic investments to be able to.Support this pillar.Second to ensure the robustness and.Usability of Stellar so we've rolled out.An upgrade to our core protocol.We've expanded our developer tools and.Our network health when you look at the.Numbers is stronger than ever.And justin's gonna go through that in.Just a few more minutes.And then finally to be the blockchain.That people know and trust.We've fully embraced virtual visibility.By making the rounds in virtual.Conferences.And hosting 20 events of our own candace.Is going to share some of those.Highlights later in the call in addition.To how we're getting more visible with.Policy makers and regulators.So the tldr is that we've made.Significant progress in q2 on.All of our goals our strategy seems to.Be working.And I'm convinced more than ever that.Our progress is proving out to be a.Strong year for Stellar.So let me share some proof points first.Let's talk about what we're doing to.Foster sustainable use cases on Stellar.Anchors are a fundamental part of our.Network to facilitate moving value from.The traditional banking system.Into Stellar and vice versa the network.Relies.On these entities that we call anchors.Anchor services help create.A world where the existing financial.Structure is connected.And interoperable with Stellar so this.Quarter.We continued our focus on building.Strong anchors in strategic markets so.This included.Bolstering the u.s anchor ecosystem with.The addition of inclusive which offers.Compliance as a service and accounts.And payment capabilities we also.Expanded on calories success.In nigeria and we're supporting new.Anchors such as click pasa in tanzania.Anchor mxn in mexico and end tokens in.Brazil.I just can't say how important anchors.Are it's an essential function for.Enabling frictionless movement of value.Between fiat currencies worldwide and.We're going to continue to expand our.Anchor footprint in markets.Where the data indicates that the.Stellar network can have an outsize.Impact specifically for remittance.Companies serving businesses and.Individual lenders.And payment processors we've also.Been building what we've talked about.Before which is our product a wallet.Called.Vibrant that saw its beta launch this.Quarter vibrant is a wallet that will.Soon be generally available in argentina.Where users will be able to hold share.Convert.And send value it also showcases.Sep 30 seller ecosystem proposal 30.About key recovery mechanism that is.Very user friendly so I encourage you.All to check it out even in the beta.Form.And then the other important way we've.Been fostering sustainable use cases on.Stuller is by.Investing in businesses on the network.We made two enterprise fund investments.In q2.One investment in satoshi pay a platform.For connecting the world through instant.Payments.And one of the earliest adopters of.Stellar satoshi pay expanded their.Business to tap into a growing b2b.Cross-border payments market.Where there is huge potential for a.Player like them who has been in this.Space and knows the opportunities.And the challenges the other investment.Went to opera.A next generation financial platform.Which is facilitating opera's.Integration with Stellar.As its blockchain back end and offers.Expansion of financial services that.Will bring.New products powered by Stellar so to.Share more about this work.And the progress they've made so far I'm.Happy to introduce bill.Barheit the ceo from oprah to the call.Thanks so much bill for joining us.Thank you for having me and good.Morning or good afternoon wherever you..May be so I'm going to spend five.Minutes just giving you.An introduction to abra's business and.Then danielle and I are going to speak a.Little bit so if you'd like to.Move into the the slides for forever. so just to give you those of.You who don't know abra.A quick overview of the services we.Provide.Abra is one of the more successful most.Successful wallets.In the cryptocurrency space today.Although we have users now using abra.For.Storing fiat and moving traditional.Money around as well.Hundreds of thousands of users in over.100 countries now I think we're.Approaching 150 countries.And we've processed processing a.Billion plus in transaction volume.Yearly. just just the ex team has executed.Extremely well.Over the last couple of years and we're.Really excited now to.Take this to the next level with Stellar.And we're really excited.That they've joined our investor base.Including american express and foxconn.And.And arbor fidelity back fund so.So just let me walk you through some.Of the details on the next slide if you.Will.Of how this this all works so in order.To.Provide this awesome service that we.Have we've had to build.Lots of capabilities both what we call.Our core capabilities as well as our.Core services.For depositing earning interest.Borrowing investing. and soon paying and spending and then.Of course all of the the back-end.Capabilities.That go into effectively running a.Fintech financial technology.Company let me walk you through a couple.Of those now and i'll go to the next.Slide.So so what everybody knows of course in.The front end.Is the ability to invest as the.World's beloved cryptocurrency investing.Wallet app. we basically work with lots of.Exchanges.And lots of partners to facilitate the.Buy sell.Hold and transfer of dozens of.Cryptocurrency assets.And now lots of .Assets and we run a very large liquidity.System to.Allow consumers in lots of countries to.Get money in and out of the system.Both in fiat via the banking system.Bank wires ach.What most of us in the us would know as.Well as cash network.So that folks in for example in.Southeast asia philippines or in central.America like in guatemala.Can actually use cash in their pockets.To get money into the abra app and then.Withdraw cash.From the abra app and to do that we've.Built a network of retail partners.To process deposits and and withdrawals.Into the app it's very complex.Difficult part of our business but.It's actually growing. it's actually growing faster even.Than the the bank part of the.Business which is really exciting it's.Been.Exploding the past the past few weeks.In particular so that's something we're.Really excited about.On the next slide I give you .If we go to the next slide.There might be a slight delay can you.Are you earn interest.I see it so so sorry about that so yeah.So just to give you a little sneak peek.On some other capabilities.This is the interest earning capability.That we're going to be. launching in the next couple of weeks.This allows consumers. for example people who not even.Aren't even familiar with cryptocurrency.To store dollars.And earn significant interest on those.Dollars or actually.Our existing crypto users can can earn.Interest.On their on their deposits as well we'll.Be supporting staking. currencies to earn interest there .Other other currencies over time so.In the next slide.You can see that in addition to .You know just what we the interest.Earning on the front end. we've built a very sophisticated. lending system where we have .Very large institutional partners .That are vetted.In our risk management processes and.Basic are borrowing those funds.In order to generate high yield for for.Our consumers and that is.That includes everything from minors.Hedge funds.Large exchanges other loan originators.And this is a good segue.Into what we're working on with Stellar.So if you'd like to go to the.To the last slide really the next the.Next phase for abra.Is is as I alluded to for us to take.This to another level.Is building an entirely new part of.Our business.In order to facilitate the movement of.Funds.Globally in real time using the Stellar.Network.And to do that and what that will enable.For us.Is all forms of global lending the first. kind of generation of lending that.You hear about in the crypto world has.To do with. people leveraging themselves to go.Along in crypto or.People borrowing against their bitcoin.Or ethereum holdings.We want to take this to another level.And and use the Stellar platform to.Truly enable.Traditional banking applications at.Global scale. trade finance rights cross-border .P2p loan origination loans like that.For example that are very difficult.For people in the west to take advantage.Of in many cases.We think are totally possible now.Leveraging the power.Of of crypto and and distiller platform.So this is just a quick.Kind of peek as to what's coming and.What we're really excited about.To be working on with Stellar so i'd.Be happy to. answer any any questions well thanks.Bill.Well thank you the idea of me being the.One to ask you questions i've been on.Your podcast so now it's my turn I get.To ask you a few. one of the things I wondered is you.Know we talk a lot about financial.Inclusion in blockchain and I just.Wondered like from your standpoint how.Is aubry focused on.Financial inclusion and what are the .How do you think about that from your.Business side.That's a great question we see financial.Inclusion as.Basically leveling access and creating a.Level playing field for access globally.So that somebody in.I mentioned philippines earlier you know.A farmer in the philippines.In in mindanao for example where we.Actually have users at abra.Can access the same services in a.Banking app as.An investment banker in san francisco.Which is a place where we also have.Users.And I think abra is one of the first.Companies to really try to create.A level playing field across all of.These different. geographies in a way that doesn't.Really differentiate.From person to person obviously in terms.Of how people might get money in and out.Of the.Out of the system would be different for.A cash user in southeast asia versus a.Banked consumer.In san francisco but other than that the.Core services they want in terms of the.Ability to invest and earn. the ability to borrow the ability to. send and share funds they're all the.Same the amounts might be different.But the ideas and and the basics of what.They want are effectively the same.And our goal is to enable that globally.And do you think that in our industry.We're already making strides to really. push this notion of financial.Inclusion forward.Well it's I think it's a mixed bag i.Think that .There's a lot of people kind of at the.At the bottom of the income pyramid.Who've done fantastic work.In building kind of micro finance.Services.That's really hard it's very expensive.It's generally not self-sustaining .With some exceptions. in mexico and india I think we've.Seen some examples of how microfinance.Can be self-sustaining but when you move.Into the middle of the income pyramid.Which is where abra is more focused.It really becomes more about creating.A a holistic kind of.Global oriented user experience that.Most banks don't understand they focus.On bank branches they focus.Just purely on compliance compliance is.Obviously very important.But it has to fit in with the user.Experience and we're starting to see.This in some of these challenger banks.Particularly in europe and and in latin.America that are gaining traction.And that's very encouraging and I think.I think you're going to see kind of a.Whole.Other generation of these challenger.Kind of services now.That are just going to leave the banks.In the dust.Okay so now I want to move a little bit.Back to Stellar and.Would love to just have your few.Thoughts about.Why you selected Stellar and why you.Thought Stellar was a great entity a.Great.Chain to build on sure I think.For us we're big believers in.Leveraging the power of cryptocurrency.Technology blockchain technology.And now stable coins which has become.Kind of a flavor of the month but it's.Simply a way of.Leveraging cryptocurrency technology to.Represent traditional value.On a blockchain to facilitate real world.Banking applications the first.Generation of all of this whether it's.The.Deep fi which the flavor of the month.Have all been around crypto for the sake.Of crypto and that's fine we needed to.Get where we are somehow.But we're excited about making this.Globally accessible for traditional.Banking applications.Many challenges there one of the biggest.Challenges we.Faced in just the kind of the 1.0 of.Abra.Was scalability a lot of what we.Originally built for example was built.On bitcoin.And it just wouldn't scale right so what.We need.Is the ability to have a platform that.Can.Can create these stable coins but can.Scale to.Truly global applications in time and.Space for us in a way that the kind of a.Lot of the first generation platforms.Could not.And that's where we think Stellar truly.Shines.All right I love that now let me just.Ask you one more question before we turn.It over to justin.And if you think about the rest of.The year and what a strange year it's.What is the one thing that you would.Love to see in this space.Change and develop by year end so.That we could actually blow things up in.2021.Yeah that's a great question so a lot of.The first generation of stable coin.Products have been very.Us-dollar-centric there's a.Little bit of a few examples of other.Things but I would really like to see.Some major g10 currencies .Really go for or accompany startups.Start to develop some g10 currencies.Beyond the dollar using.Stablecoin technologies like Stellar or.Others.And start to see a lot of traction in .Forex.Applications money transfer remittances. cross-border business payments that.Start to take advantage of this ability.To do on the wire.Money transfer if we see that.Then we know that we have real proof.Points for crypto.Being useful in the quote unquote real.World and we know it's coming it's just.A question of is it going to happen.You know in the next few months you know.The next year et cetera et cetera.But that would personally excite me the.Most it may sound boring.But that's what it's going to take to.Make this really useful.At global scale so awesome that would be.Great to see that happen thank you so.Much bill for joining us and I know that.You'll be available afterwards for.Also questions.So at this point I'm going to turn it.Over to justin who's going to walk us.Through some network stats and other.Things that he.Wants to share with us great thanks to.Now.Thanks bill I'm justin rice head of.Ecosystem at sdf.And I'm super excited to be here to.Share more about the continued growth of.The network.And the development of Stellar.Technology so Stellar is open source.And open participation and many of the.Advancements SDF makes are in.Collaboration with our ecosystem.In these uncertain times when it's clear.So many are struggling.We've been asking ourselves how can we.Work with our ecosystem to make a.Difference.Now of course we believe the technology.We're working on will help address some.Key underlying issues over the long term.But we also continue to ask ourselves.What can we do to help today.So we've decided that part of our.Short-term answer is to continue our.Partnership with lumenthropy.Which is a Stellar-based platform for.Charitable donations.This time to rally our community to.Support an organization.Deeply relevant to today's challenges.The usf.Institute for non-violence and social.Justice which is a 501c3.Driving research education and advocacy.To advance the practice of.Transformational.Non-violence so for the entire month of.July.We will match lumen donations made by.Our community to the institute.Up to two million lumens we kicked off.The campaign with a 100 000 lumen.Donation.And we're excited to see what our.Community will contribute to make the.World a better.More generous and more compassionate.Place now let's take a look at this.Quarter's numbers.And talk a bit about what they mean. so here are some key network stats.And we'll sort of go through them.Quickly.The number of accounts on the network.Has been stable hovering around 4.5.Million total.We've seen a slight increase in the.Number of daily operations.Up 9 from q1 and that represents solid.Network throughput and speaks to the.Scalability of the network.There was a significant uptick in.Average daily trading volume on.Stellar's decentralized exchange. this quarter we saw about 5.9 million.Lumens worth of trades per day.Which is a 70 increase from last quarter.The total number of payments has also.Grown.Consistently over q2 9 million to more.Than 13 million as of june 30th there.Were 7.893 on-chain assets which is a lot.I think it's important to note that.We're working on a method to distinguish.And measure meaningful assets. those are assets that contribute to.The connected financial.Financial infrastructure that we're.Trying to build assets very in line with.The anchor strategy that danel mentioned.Earlier.And many of these 7000 plus on-chain.Assets will be beyond the scope of our.Area of focus.But one thing is for sure people find it.Very very easy to issue assets using.Stellar.Lastly let's take a look at where the.Network is in terms of health and.Decentralization.There are currently 23 tier 1 validating.Nodes.And about 120 nodes total that's about.The same as last quarter.And what we mentioned then bears.Repeating the network would continue. it would keep going even if the sdf.Turned off all of its notes.What's more encouraging is that we're.Seeing more organizations in the.Pipeline.To join the ranks of the tier one.Validators and that's because there are.More businesses.Invested in the network want to increase.Their engagement and are capable of.Doing so.Those tier 1 validators are fundamental.To the health and stability of the.Network they're also important to its.Governance.And they help drive important upgrades.To the network like the adoption of.Protocol 13.And q12 so protocol 13.On june 18th the Stellar public network.Upgraded to protocol 13.Like all important network-wide settings.Protocol version is decided by.Validating nodes.Who vote for and agree to new protocol.Versions the same way they vote for an.Agree to transaction sets. a protocol upgrade implements a.Bundle of core.Core advancement proposals also known as.Caps and protocol 13 included five.The first two CAP 28 and CAP 30 they're.Really technical optimizations.One involved pre-auth signers the other.Involved operation response codes.We won't get into the nitty-gritty.Details here but the key takeaway for.Those two.They both held Stellar core and.Therefore the network as a whole run a.Little leaner.But what made this release really.Exciting was the addition of three.Powerful new features.The first is fee bumps CAP 15 which.Empower app builders to cover user fees.So they can create.Simpler and better customer experiences.They also allow validators to increase.The minimum network fee.Without invalidating pre-signed.Transactions thereby giving them the.Flexibility to respond to changes in.Network usage.So they can ensure that Stellar.Continues to function as a fast.Efficient and decentralized system for.The second feature in protocol 13 is.Fine.Grain control of asset authorization cap.18 which grants issuers of regulated.Assets the ability to approve user.Transactions.On a case-by-case basis without.Cancelling open orders on the books.So this optimizes Stellar so it's a.Great option for issuing assets with.High compliance requirements.Like security tickets and the third.Protocol 13 feature is.First class multiplexed accounts CAP 27.Which allows exchanges and custodial.Services to map a single Stellar account.To multiple users.Without relying on inefficient.Workarounds we've learned a lot by.Talking to some of the larger crypto.And this change will not only make their.Lives easier it will also.Pave the way for businesses that want to.Manage client accounts to build on.In addition to these changes at the.Protocol level level of the network.We've also made some important.Advancements for developers and.Businesses.On the application level for example.We introduced SEP 30. to now mention that earlier it's a.Seamless user-focused solution for key.Management and key recovery. as Denelle was mentioned then and.When she was talking about samsung key.Management is one of the biggest.Impediments to user adoption.Not just for Stellar but for crypto.Generally and it's also one of the most.Difficult.Problems to solve for keys aren't.Something you can remember they're.Complicated strings of letters and.Numbers.And in most crypto apps if you lose your.Key you permanently lose access to your.Account.And that just doesn't work for most.Human beings so you can't introduce an.App to the general public and grow it at.Scale.If a small human error can cost you.Everything there has to be some sort of.Recourse.I'm not going to get into all the.Technical details but step 30 solves the.Problem of key management by leveraging.Stellar's built-in multi-sig.To allow a user to easily recover access.To an account without ever giving.Control of that account to a third party.As Denelle mentioned vibrant is built on.Step 30 and I tested it last week.All I had to remember to access my.Account was my phone number. the implications of sub 30 could be.Huge right it paves the way.For a new breed of user friendly apps on.Stellar and we're really excited to see.What businesses.And developers can do we also did a.Complete overhaul of our developer.Documentation.The docs are now leaner better looking.And more focused on today's use cases.They're organized around learning paths.And will continue to add more learning.Paths as network use cases evolve.Stellar's always been known for having.Good documentation and we kept.Everything that was working with this.New update.We just made it even easier to learn how.To build on Stellar.That's it for me so with that it's my.Pleasure to turn it over to candace.Kelly.Our general counsel to share with you.What we've been doing to be the.Blockchain people know and trust.Candace.Thanks so much justin it's great to.Be here again I'm candice kelly the.General counsel.It's really encouraging to see all the.Growth in our network and in the.Technology.We've also been busy this quarter.Getting vocal and visible.Virtually of course in this pandemic.Time on the policy front.We became a platform partner in the.World economic forum.Center for the fourth industrial.Revolution.As a member we're on the digital.Currency governance consortium.Which is a working group of industry.Stakeholders addressing.Key questions and governance gaps posed.By new forms.Of digital currency including stable.Coins.The consortium has a number of working.Groups and we're focusing specifically.On the digital currency use cases the.Working group will assess.Where digital currency may add value.Including a number of areas that are.Right in our strike zone.For example the potential for digital.Currency to replace cash.Particularly in pandemic time issues.Related to the need for lower cost.Remittances and cross-border payments.Financial inclusion money laundering and.Strengthening of aml cft capacities.Domestic and cross-border regulatory.Oversight and coordination.Monetary control and central bank.Digital currencies.And since as justin just mentioned.Stellar was designed for stable coins.And cbdc's we find that it's very easy.To issue assets.On the Stellar network we're looking.Forward to see how.We'll advance this important work of the.And then to strengthen sds capacity to.Join more policy discussions.And forums like the like the west and to.Raise awareness for Stellar within the.Policy maker and regulatory spheres.We also hired a new head of policy and.Government relations.Who's focused primarily on engagement in.Dc.But he's already getting up to speed on.Policy issues that reach well beyond.Our borders as well but we haven't just.Been getting vocal with policy makers we.Devoted.A lot of q2 to both joining and hosting.Virtual events.We participated in eight industry events.We ran a Stellar foundation session at.Consensus distributed.Where we shared the vision of Stellar in.2020 and also highlighted businesses.Built on Stellar.Both jed and Denelle were on stage at.Block down to 2.0.Jed was on a mastermind panel on.Interoperability.And Denelle delivered a keynote on her.Favorite topic of the.Of the moment key management Denelle.Also presented to a global audience of.Entrepreneurs.At road to tycon in june we also focused.On.Expanding our own capacity to host.Virtual events which resulted in a total.Of 20 events.We had 16 in english and we had four in.Spanish throughout the quarter ranging.From webinars workshops.Round tables engineering talks some of.The highlights include a webinar on.Anchor basics.The business and benefits of being an.Anchor a webinar on compliance.And the Stellar network supporting our.Announcement of our partnership with.Elliptic an engine engineering talk on.Kelp.Which is a free customizable open source.Trading bot for the Stellar universal.Marketplace.And a roundtable discussion on ecosystem.Standards for creating payment corridors.Which ultimately resulted in the.Creation of step 31.Which is helping anchors in the network.Sending and receiving.Transactions which is a tool that helps.Them to comply with.The travel role in addition to our.Aggressive efforts.In the communications front SDF executed.A series of paid marketing initiatives.To further awareness and understanding.Of the Stellar network.Our two speaking appearances at the.Consensus distributed conference.Were complemented by sponsorship.Activation within the virtual conference.As well as within coindesk podcast.Series additionally.Sdf advertised on the unchained podcast.Hosted by laura shin.And we've also begun testing the.Effectiveness of online search and.Display media.We also started preparations for our.Biggest virtual event of all.Which is our second annual Stellar.Conference.Meridian meridian is set for november.16th through the 20th.And in the context of the ongoing.Pandemic we've decided.That the event will be held virtually.And it will be free of charge.The theme of the event is global.Connections to solve real world.Challenges.Stay tuned for updates like speaker and.Program announcements.By signing up at meridian.org.So that's it for me lauren i'll hand it.Back to you.Thank you candice and thank you everyone. those.We're now ready to open it up to q a so.If you have questions please submit them.In the chat box in the upper left hand.Corner of your screen. it looks like we already have one.That we can kick.Off with Denelle I think this one.Probably best suited for you is. to what extent has sdf's work been.Impacted.Or not by the pandemic that's such a.Great question.And it's such a hard question because as.You can see by what we've done in q2.During the the heart of the pandemic i.Think we've done awesome work.And I'm so grateful for all of our team.Members who've spent so much of their.Time.Focused on the work even in a time when.There's so many other things in the.World to focus on.So we've kind of nailed it in terms of.The work that we've done but I can't.Pretend that this hasn't impacted. SDF in particular just because our.Sdf.In addition to our the Stellar ecosystem.From an sds standpoint we have we were.Open to remote already we had lots of.Employees that were working remotely.And so this has just broadened that and.Made it so that we're all working from.Our homes and in our home offices.And and really I think doing a great job.Working together .But I have to say like it's hard and i.Think everybody's experiencing this all.Around the world that it's it gets hard.When you don't have as much human.Contact as you're used to.So we really are trying to focus on.Getting folks to step away from their.Computers and to have some.Of their personal and alone time so that.They can really like.Fuel what they need to feel in their.Life so that they can still give back to.Us but also to their families. I will say that I think that we're.Very mindful.That even though SDF I think has been.Pretty strong and done some really great.Work and had.And we're stable in terms of our.Financials there are others in the.Ecosystem who've been impacted so.We keep a really close eye on how the.Ecosystem is doing just to make sure.That we have an understanding and that.We can do what we can do to support the.Ecosystem.With respect to any kind of work that we.Can do documentation we can provide.To make things seamless and easy so all.Told I think we've done.A fairly good job of really staying.Focused during this.But I can't deny that it's just hard i.Think it's hard for all of us.Thanks danielle I think the next.Question we have that came in here is.Bill at abra so I think you know.We made the announcement back in may.About how you're going to be using.Stellar and so.Maybe you could explain kind of what's.Happened from may to now.Sure so this is happening in in.Phases for us.Yes we are our goal is to build a.Series of global.Banking services which also.Take advantage of the Stellar network.And the first phase for us.Is our lending business and that's.Already launched.Where we're basically building .Relationships with. lots of institutional players who.Will be.Partnering with abra in the lending.Space.That tends to be stuff that we don't.Necessarily announce but but is.Essential for. building up liquidity in our.And then the technology part of this is.Something that we'll be working on. mostly in the second half of this.Year.And then the launch of that will also is.Actually related to the question Denelle.Just answered. to the state of the kind of the.The lending markets because of covet. and you know for example if we're.Looking at cross-border.P2p loan origination for example or.Cross-border trade.Trade finance applications a lot of what.We end up doing.From a risk management perspective will.Depend upon.The state of the markets and you know.This.Is the goal here is to and this is the.Second part of your question that I see. benjamin is that this extends. what's working in d5 way beyond just.Crypto for the sake of crypto.But really to make it truly useful in.Traditional finance.Applications my favorite is.Cross-border .P2p loan origination because this means.That loan originators.There are many p2p loan originators for.Example now.Who are well funded in southeast asia.Latin america.But they have to source capital locally.And it's often very expensive.Because the traditional banks won't play.And by.Opening that up to other forms of.Capital .That means that we can eventually drive.The rates down for.Small business and individual loans in.In those emerging markets.And I think that leveraging stable coin.Technology for example to be able to.Move that money around.Very quickly is an essential part of.Enabling that over time because we just.Can't do it fast enough be in the banks.Thank you thank you. so I think the next next question.We've got here.Is for Denelle you mentioned having a.Growing anchor footprint. what's been the driver behind getting.More anchors on board and do we have a.Goal for the number of anchors that we.Would ultimately get to.So so anchors are my next favorite topic. and set 30 and anchors are kind of.Close in terms of the.The needs and the value that anchors and. and then and then also key recovery.Bring to the network and just to.Blockchain generally having financial.Institutions.On the network and creating corridors so.That businesses and individuals can.Benefit for the.From these cross-border transactions is.Just crucial for the success.Of the Stellar network and so the driver.Has been very clearly that.We need them and the other driver has.Been demand from.We have corridors that are already open.And then we have demand from.Some of the anchors to say hey we would.Love to have you know another anchor on.The other side.In brazil for example or another anchor.On the other side in mexico so that we.Can actually have those transactions go.Back and forth.So it's the increasing volume on the.Network the increasing.Requirements that we see to open up more.And more corridors that are driving.The need for anchors but this is just a.Really.Important part of what we need to do and.What I see.Our value add to the network is from an.Sds standpoint is that we can help these.Financial institutions to be able to.Integrate.And to seamlessly operate with the the.Network and with the other players on it.And I don't look at this in terms of.Numbers because I think that it's more.Important that you think about it in.Terms of corridors being open.So we're actually working now to.Determine what our we're doing our q3.Okrs right now to determine what we want.To see in terms of growth.But I'm not going to lie I would love to.See like 10 20 30 more anchors on the.In the next six months now that's.Just a huge number to bring on.But it would just be fantastic to be.Able to see more and more quarters open.Up.So that we can have more and more room.For other businesses to join and.Participate.In what we see is just a growing.Thanks danielle I think the next.Question here is probably for.Justin justin are there any technical.Advancements like future caps or seps.That you anticipate.That are in the works. yeah that's a great question there.Are several i'll talk about some of the.Few like some of the most important ones. protocol 14 is well underway and it.Involves.Two caps that introduce also new great.Features. CAP 23 which introduces claimable.Balances.They allow sending a payment to an.Account that is not yet prepared to.Receive it.And CAP 33 which introduces sponsored.Reserves.Essentially allowing an app to cover.User reserves so users don't have to.Understand or.Manage a lumen balance both these things.Work together to basically.Make it so that you can build apps that. manage.All of the sort of crypto aspects of.Stellar and conceal the complexity of.Crypto from users.So people can build payment apps that.Look and feel like payment apps rather.Than like.Crypto payment apps and that's those.Two will be part of protocol 14.Which is in the works and once it's done.We'll sort of start rolling it out and.Working with the ecosystem.To get the network upgraded well.Underway the second sort of.Big one that we're working on and we've.Been working on for a while is a step.Again a sort of.Ecosystem level solution for a problem.That many people building on Stellar.Phase. this one is called step 31 and.Essentially it's it's designed in.Conjunction with some current anchors.It enables two anchors to interoperate.To pass required information.And makes it so a user can send fiat.From their bank account.Directly to the recipient's bank account.Again this conceals sort of the.Complexity of crypto from users and it.Also allows these anchors to comply with.The travel rules so they comply with an.Important regulation.That requires financial institutions to.Share certain info.About parties involved in a transaction.And step 31 is like.A spec that has been worked out and in.Fact we just added step 31 functionality.To polaris which is a reference.Implementation that people can use.So that anchors can set this up really.Easily and say those are the two.Two big things.Thank you justin okay I think we have.Another question that came in here and.This one I think is for bill.So I think some people saw the news.About the announcement of the settlement.You had with regulators yesterday.And just general question about whether.You anticipate any impact from that on.Your business.Sure that's a good question.Back in I believe in the november.December time frame. and we've long since moved on in our.Business so basically for the last.Seven months.Of the business that we've been running.As had basically been post.Those agreements so it just.Happens to have been yesterday that.The sec and cftc made the announcements.We actually have no visibility as to.When they're going to do that it's kind.Of a black.That was just a coincidence and as i.Said abra has long since moved on. I'm not allowed to comment on the.Content of the agreements except to say.You know we're fine with how far our.Business in the us in particular is.Doing really really well.And we're really happy with how.Things stand so.No no concerns.Great thank you very much for sharing.That and I think we have one.Last question coming in here and it's.Candid candice what kind of policy.Objectives.Are you looking to achieve by engaging.In dc and with. like the world economic forum as you.Mentioned in your part of the.Presentation.Thanks lauren that's a good question.I think this is a really exciting time.In the policy world of cryptocurrency. I will say that I think that the .Announcement of libra last year and then.The pandemic.And the discussions around digital.Dollar and getting stimulus checks out.In a secure and efficient.Way has really raised the profile and.And the interest level on the hill and.In dc.With both regulators and policy makers.In terms of first just understanding.What it is.I think that there were a lot of folks.Who were quite well educated on.On cryptocurrency and blockchain.Technology but they're they're.A lot who are still getting up to speed.On that.And there's a there's an urgency and an.Interest in doing that which makes it.Really a great opportunity for us.And I think that Stellar the SDF as a.Non-profit is in a unique.Role in that we we really hope to be.Able to be.A credible voice in just helping in that.Education.Department and obviously it starts with.And then participation having somebody.Now a full-time person who can.Really focus on these issues is.Fantastic.And then advocacy is the is the.Ultimate goal so.Both within dc and then as I mentioned. it's impossible with the global.Nature of.Our business and this technology to not.Be jumping in.To conversations in all different.Jurisdictions.As regulators across the globe are.Trying to figure this out and. and take advantage of blockchain in a.Safe and compliant way so.The world economic forum is one way that.We're doing that but we're also engaging.With.With anchors and partners across the.Globe in making sure that we are being.Helpful in both educating and advocating.On that on the.Policy front.Great well I think that is all the.Questions we had.Thank you to our speakers for joining.Today if anyone on the call has.Follow-up questions feel free to.Email us at media `stellar.org` and thank.You everyone.For joining us today.
