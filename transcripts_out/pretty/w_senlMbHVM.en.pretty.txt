Okay yeah but welcome finally we I think.We got sorted out the the issues uh and.Uh yeah welcome to this week's uh.Stellar developer meeting and uh today I.Uh we have two presentations we have.Chris that's going to to talk about P.Keys and we have S out who going to talk.About increasing sorond limits so I will.Just uh I'll just let you uh take it.From here Chris uh do you need to share.Your screen yeah yeah let me do that.Okay.Right okay okay yes I guess I can't let.Me see let me check the comments yes.Okay cool thanks Elliot cool yeah so uh.Thanks everyone thanks for bearing with.Us uh through um you know some technical.Difficulties here uh but yeah let's get.Go ahead and get started um so this.Presentation here is um a subset of a.Presentation I gave at Devcon in Bangkok.At several events including multichain.Day and uh funding the commons uh which.Is a a public goods organization which.Is really cool uh but basically we're.Talking about uh past Keys could kind of.Like I would say a revolution and user.Experience for web three onboarding um.So yeah let's go ahead and jump in so.Thank you than you all for joining.Future stack smart contract wallets and.Pass keys on.Stellar um yeah so so basically um yeah.My name is Chris anatalia I'm a.Developer advocate for uh for Stellar.Development foundation um and let's go.Ahead and just dive in so yeah we're.Just GNA give you a quick intro to like.The what and why of p pasis and then we.Dive into this really cool project uh.That Tyler built um which is basically a.Typescript library that helps abstract.Away the complexity of integrating pass.Keys into your D app and then we're.Going to actually go through a reference.Application uh where we actually.Implement this pass Keys kit um and just.Kind kind of demo the functionality it.Exposes to you uh so first off why pass.Keys uh well everyone knows passwords.Are terrible right but they've reached.Such a level of terribleness.That it's it's hard to uh ignore right.So I mean other than um you know packs.And leaks of uh of password databases.You know between that and just the.Requirements that users find very hard.Uh they basically users aren't most.Users are not following best practice of.Operational security um just because.It's difficult right uh so pass keys to.The rescue right so pass keys are.Basically faster easier and safer right.And they kind of get rid of you know um.You know having to bage all these.Different passwords and having like it.Secure onetime passwords uh sent to you.Via SMS right so pass Keys basically are.Enabled by um well what's called a.Secure Enclave on I believe iPhone.Devices but basically you have a special.Chip um that can do secure cryptographic.Operations right um so so basically your.Device kind of Acts almost like a UB ke.Not exactly but basically your device.Acts as uh your source of authentication.Right uh so you're able to leverage.Something like uh fingerprint or uh face.ID uh to be able to register and sign in.For accounts as you see here happening.Um basically yeah you can either use.Your device or you can use something.Like a password manager to manage your.Pass Keys uh but basically yeah no more.13 character passwords and all all of.That jumping through all those hoops and.Ultimately it is safer you know because.It's not stored somewhere in a database.That a hacker could break into.Right the pass Keys kit is uh this.Really great uh typescript uh library.That you can pull into your project uh.Using we recommend you use uh PP npm uh.For uh dependency management but yeah.Basically it's a great Library uh you.Can find it at GitHub kale Pass Key kit.Um and basically gives you all the.Functionality you need to create and.Manage uh Stellar smart.Wallets so like I said before you can.Find it uh you just add it as a.Dependency to your project uh if you.Scan that QR code it'll bring you to the.Repo if you want to check it out.Um but it's all GitHub you know you can.Just Google it as well uh so yeah.Definitely check it out it's um it's.It's really cool but yeah we we'll go.Through it here um so basically the pass.Key kit allows you to implement signers.Uh you know various interactions with.Your mall with your uh wallet uh and.Also uh really cool things like uh like.Policy signers which allow you to Grant.Explicit permissions uh to a signer.Uh a functions as both a client and.Server Side Library uh with launch Tu um.On the server side that kind of helps.Abstract away the complexity of.Submitting.Transactions uh to the.Network right so so the client lib is.Pass Key kit and the server lib is Pass.Key.Server and uh you can check at Super.Peach uh as another reference uh.Implementation.So if we want to check out um Pass Key.Kit a little bit right so if you jump.Into the actual Pass Key kit repo and.You go to sour kit.TS you can see um.Like kind of the nelt and bolts of how.It works right you pass in your your RPC.URL um you know the static Network.Keyphrase um and then you know it kind.Of It kind of set up all the stuff for.You right and then it'll expose these.Functions like create wallet.Um that basically you know allows you to.Um perform all this functionality with.With basically just a function call um.Yeah so this is like the pass key kit uh.Client side code um and with your uh in.Your actual application so when you.Initialize your passy kit right you.Import it and then U you create an.Instance of it right uh pass in your RPC.URL uh of the public node you're using.Um and then you know as a seller.Developer you know uh each You Know M.Net test net feature net they have this.Static nwk Network passphrase um you.Know that you pass in for instance test.SDF Network semicolon September 2015 and.Then um and then the deployed uh Factory.Contract address.Um which is uh the the factory that.Generates um your spart contract wallet.Right um yeah then that will be have to.That will have to be deployed uh.Beforehand on your selected.Net um taking a quick look at the P key.Server if you dig it to server uh.Server.TS um you can see uh basically.It's kind of the same thing you know.You're taking it um launch tube URL uh.Depending on which if you're on M dat or.Test that um then you also need a jot.Token which is u a Json web token which.Kind of authenticates use launch tube uh.We have self-served for that on testet I.Believe uh but for main that I think you.Need to reach out to the team.Um but yeah so when setting out the pass.Key server um in your application right.You pass in your RPC URL you pass in.Your lodg tube URL and you pass in your.Lodge tube jot token.Right so in this case we're importing it.From uh a EnV file um so so that stuff.Will just be sitting in your local .v.Config.File uh so if you want to follow along.And you want to check out the demo app I.Built you can uh scan this QR code or.You could find it at analo CS pass Keys.Kit Stellar reference.Implementation and yeah we we'll uh.We'll said that out later too if you.Don't catch it.Here uh so basically the use cases we're.Going to cover is creating a wallet.Signing into existing.Wallet uh a smart contract.Invocation adding a ed25519 signer and.Then adding a policy signer and also.Talking about some of those.Nuances so if you follow along with um.With the application if you want to pull.It down and just run it locally uh.Basically here is the first example.Right so what we're doing here is we're.Creating a new wallet right um and then.That wallet actually gets created as a.Deployed contract to testet as you can.See here um right and then within the.Date of that contract you see the cider.So basically you you click create pass.Uh create uh new Pass key right and then.In a browser um you I you can either use.Your fingerprint on your MacBook or.Password manager right um and then the.The factory contract creates that smart.Contract that you can see here you can.See in uh Stell expert.Um everything that's getting created.Right so yeah just going through a.Couple times so you so you see it all.You know you create the transaction you.That gets submitted by launch tube right.Um the factory contract creates your.Spart contract uh wallet right um and.Then.And that it's here for you to use um in.The future that's linked to your pass.Key on your.Device right so uh digging into that.Code a little bit so so uh the front end.Calls this create wallet function right.Um so we name the wallet we and then uh.We call uh passy Wallet create wallet.Right um we configured this object.Earlier uh at the top of the screen.Right with the RPC URL and all those.Parameters right uh so we invoke that.Create wallet uh function and then we.Get the assemble transaction right and.Then we use the pass key kit server to.Send that transaction right so just.Going through it again uh right so we we.Get the the what the wallet should be.Named we pass in um the key ID the.Contract ID oh no we we get back all.These fields what we call um the create.Wallet function right so um we print out.The transaction that we just created and.Then we use a pass key kit server to.Actually send that transaction and then.We log the response of that transaction.Right um and then you know all all.Seller Cy to be uh funded so we fund.That wallet as a final.Step um so also so if you want to so.When we print out the transaction info.You guys actually grab the the envelope.Xdr and then you can go to laboratory.Sell.com um and if you want to dig into.A lot of the details of what's happening.In that transaction you can use lab.Stellar.org um and kind of dig into some.Of the um the nitty-gritty of the oper.The actual operations being executed um.Yeah that that's available at lab.Stellar.org.Xdr um and in this reference application.That um envelope X gets printed out in.The console uh for you to grab.Right so when signing into an existing.Pass Keys wallet right um You can either.Use a key ID or um you the browser could.Promp you right um and then so when you.Sign into that existing wallet that's.Existing smart wallet pass Keys wallet.Uh that you created um you're able to do.That um just using um your fingerprint.For instance right um and then yeah so.It's like a really simple user.Experience you log in uh here's the.Smart contract uh that we created.Previously that represents your pasy.Smart wallet uh and yeah it's it's way.Simpler than managing a a 12 12w.Passphrase you know much much lighter um.Much less friction onboarding new users.Right right um so yeah you know a lot of.This functionality is similar right so.To sign in very similar to uh creating a.Wallet right uh you either uh type it.You either pass it the key ID or it'll.Prop you um for either your fingerprint.Or your U password manager managed Pass.Key right uh and then all you do is you.Connect to that pass key uh that you.Already created um and then yeah you're.Pretty good to you're pretty much good.To go you know that's that's basically.The whole authentication.[Music].Flow um for invoking a contract so so.Now um so so now we're we actually we've.Created this smart contract pass Keys.Wallet that could actually invoke a.Deployed contract right uh so we have uh.We deployed this smart contract um.Called math basically and all it does is.It adds two integers right so um there's.A do math function on the spark contract.That we're actually invoking using our.Pas key wallet right so when we call.This invoke function right we are.Signing using our Pass Key our.Fingerprint um creating that transaction.And then having launch tube helps shoot.Off that transaction to the network died.Byer pasy wallet you know so I mean the.Actual operation is kind of trivial but.The the idea behind it is pretty cool.Right um it's kind of like the whole.Abstra account abstraction flow where.You have a smart wallet that could.Actually uh invoke a smart.Contract um so digging into the code.That's called there uh so this do math.Function gets invoked right and um so we.Have this contract instant.Uh where we're calling the do math.Function right and then we're going to.Sign it with our Pass key right um and.Then after it's signed we're going to.Use a pass key server and launch tube to.Actually shoot off that transaction to.The network um and then we're going to.Uh dig into the xdr um of the response.And see um the sum of the two numbers we.Added right that's a trivial operation.But as you imagine you can do basically.Anything in spart contract function and.Basically this is a nuts and bolts of.Using a pass Keys wallet to sign a.Transaction and invoke another smart.Contract.Operation um which is really amazing.Right uh it's such a cool library that.Tyler built here um it's so like user.Friendly and easy to use it's it's.Pretty awesome um so let's say you.Wanted to um add add another CER to uh.Your pass key wallet right um yeah I.Mean like that that's that's definitely.Possible right you can just add you know.Any any any classic Stell account as a.Cider um what's dangerous there is.You're basically granting them access to.Do do anything right on your account uh.Which is dangerous right uh for.I hope obvious reasons but yeah yeah.Obviously like if you want to Grant.Someone access to your account you want.To Grant fine grain access where you.Explicitly control what you're what.You're kind of giving them um so so.Basically um since we're passing an.Empty signers limit limits map we're not.Really con constraining the permissions.We're giving them right uh so when we.When we sign this transaction and we set.It at the CER we're actually um allow.The CER to do anything on our behalf um.For for that uh pasy wallet right so.That's obviously not ideal.Um what's cool here is uh we're adding.What's called a policy CER like I'm not.Sure this is currently on mainnet but it.It basically.Um the way I explain it is like it it.Pro there's like like a a proxy contract.Right so basically you have to go.Through this proxy contract which kind.Of constrains what abilities you're able.To take um on that invocation um so so.Basically uh you're you're granting a.Very uh fine grained uh set of.Permissions to The Cider um allowing.Them to perform a specific activity um.Without giving them full access to your.Account right so obviously that's that's.I that's way more ideal than granting.You know u a blank check to a Aigner so.So for attaching a policy CER U you'll.Notice a difference here is we're.Actually adding in an entry to the.Signer limits right U and as you can see.We're passing in the the do math uh.Deployed contract hash but then also.Another contract called do math policy.And that policy is kind of the proxy.Contract that kind of dictates uh what.You're able to do are that defined uh.Doe math contract right so like the call.Has to go through uh that policy first.Which kind of constrains uh what what.You're able to do um with that cider so.This is kind of like uh I would say.Revolutionary I think yeah I think it's.A really cool concept you know you're.Able to U kind kind of delegate um to.Another signer very fine grain.Permissions you know which I think is.Very powerful um and yeah it's just a.Really cool thing that Tyler built here.Right uh so like yeah if you want to.Check out some more Pass Key demos right.Uh Elliot uh he created this really cool.Dice roller game um and then is super.Peach the classic uh implementation uh.There's a little demo built into Pas key.Kit repo itself right um and if you need.A lot Tobe J token I think we do self.Serve for test that but also just reach.Out to us on.Discord cool uh.Yeah okay great thank you that it was.Very interesting uh we we uh we actually.Did a similar presentation at Meridian.At the hackathon and a lot of the teams.Chose to implement U pass which was.Great to see because they had they had.Limited time to to get their application.Built and they decided a lot of them.Decided to use pass keys and they got.Pretty pretty smooth so so yeah.Definitely go go check it out I think.It's it's uh it's it's it's a huge.Improvement in in user experience uh.When we talk about the uh when we talk.About web three apps okay great uh I.Will now invite Z up and uh he'll talk.Talk about the um about the um.Increasing soran limits so please go.Ahead yeah can you hear me yeah perfect.Okay yeah I don't have a presentation.Today so I'll just uh speaking to you.But um uh Carson should be dropping a.Couple links to some documents that'll.Be helpful yeah I'm uh my name is sart s.I'm a software engineer on the core team.And today I'll be going over a proposal.From the ecosystem to increase some.Sorond limits uh and for cont from some.Context uh suron transactions are.Subject to various settings and Lins.That can be updated with the validator.Vote similar to our protocol.Upgrade so there were three separate.Proposals to increase limits from the.Ecosystem and slp1 uh which there's a.Link in the in the comments below uh is.A combination of all three and you can.See the proposers in the author section.Of the.SLP uh so first I'll go over the Ledger.Entry limits so the read entry and right.Entry limits are being increased for.Both the transaction level and Ledger.Level limits the max Ledger entries that.Can be read in a transaction is.Increasing from 40 to 100 and the max.Ledger entries that can be written in a.Transaction is uh written is increasing.From 25 to 50 so these increases will.Allow uh defi protocols like like Hoops.Finance uh Sor Swap and blend to scale.Up and perform more complex transactions.That they aren't able aren't able to do.Today with uh current.Limits so to make sure that the the.Network can actually handle the.Increased runtime from these increased.Limits we developed a command line.Benchmarking tool in Stellar core that.Lets us measure Ledger apply times using.Different sorbon settings so the tool.Will uh generate a a worst case.Transaction set that uses as much of the.Resources available as possible apply.Those transactions and then just records.The apply time and the the SLP has some.More information and results from this.Testing So based on the benchmarking.Sellar core can handle the increase the.Transaction level minuts limits I.Mentioned as well as increasing The.Ledger level limits to maintain the.Current 5x ratio between the transaction.And Ledger level.Limits uh now the last limit being.Increased is the max transaction events.Size limit which is the combined size of.The events that can be emitted within.The single transaction.Uh and the current limit is 8 kilobytes.Uh and this limit is low enough that.Some protocols like a squid router will.Run into the limit when publishing.Payloads that they don't want to manage.Offchain so the proposal bumps it to 16.Kilobytes a benchmarking this increase.In Stellar core however isn't very.Valuable Stellar core just adds the.Events to the transaction meta and.Writes it to a pipe when I did my.Benchmarking and I increased the the.Events limit I saw no uh hit to.Performance cuz in seller core.Specifically so it's more relevant to.Hear from Downstream consumers to get.Their opinion on if they can handle the.Increased theoretical load and I say.Theoretical because in practice uh we.Don't see large amounts of data emitted.Through events at the moment uh so I.Guess our ask here is for feedback on if.Any of you expect issues from this uh.From this increase to the events limit.Uh so all of the increased limits from.Slp1 have been apply to test met uh so.Feel free to try them out and I also.Wanted to mention that the uh SLP.Process is new and still being improved.Uh but the end goal is to allow anyone.In the ecosystem to propose new settings.And evaluate them using the tooling I.Mentioned currently the tooling is is.Still being worked on and we have we.Don't have a lot of documentation for it.Yet but we're hoping soon that all this.All all this will be good enough uh.For uh someone in the ecosystem to go.Through the entire the entire proposal.And evaluation process without our help.Uh so and the current SLP proposal.Format can be found at the read me in.That Stellar protocol link that was that.Was dropped in the.Comments uh so yeah that's all I had for.Today if there are any questions let me.Know great thank you yeah if if there's.Any questions uh please uh drop them in.The in the comments uh this is uh.Something that we are going to try to.Experiment with going forward when we do.Some upgrades and when we do some uh.Updates and change limits and things.Like that uh just to have a quick have a.Quick talk about it here in the in the.Weekly developer meetings uh next week.We actually going to talk about uh the.Protocol 22 and and some of the some of.The new features that was launched there.Uh that was it but that's what we had.For for the meeting today uh thank you.To to both our presenters for for taking.The time to to to speak here and uh yeah.I'll see everyone else next Thursday.Thank you.
