Hello and welcome to this me this week's.Uh Stella developer meeting today I have.A guest and the guest is actually from.My own team it's uh Elliot and uh and.Ell is going to talk about a project.That he's been working on and it's it's.A fun project uh in our team and the.Deal team we talked about it should be.Fun to learn to to build on on stellar.And one of the ways can do that is to.Play around ourself and and build some.Some cool stuff uh we can play around.With and uh hopefully you find find fun.Too and then of course there's a lot of.Learning involved in that so I'm very.Very excited to to introduce you to uh.To Eliot and and his pet project kale.Fil uh so maybe you can just give a.Little introduction to how how did this.All get started I think has something to.Do with kale yeah so um uh like Carson.Mentioned my my name is Elliot I am a.Developer Advocate also here at SDF I.Get to be at Jack of all trades in a lot.Of ways and I love I've Loved for a long.Long time uh just messing around with.Stellar having fun and um just breaking.Stuff as you said Matias um go I was.Reminiscing with Tyler earlier today.About um all the ways that we used to.Kind of like Jerry rig this chain of.Operations into creating some smart.Contract esque kind of thing um but.Sorban is one-year-old today and we have.Actual official real life smart.Contracts on stellar and it's an amazing.Time to be developing in the uh.Community and it's an amazing time to be.Here having fun I think a lot of the.Time we get kind of like caught up in.The seriousness of what we are doing.Here at stellar and the uh the real life.Implications of what we're building and.Sometimes there's just room for like.Something on the lighter side you know.And so Tyler uh started that in that.Vein recently with kale I think it was.Back in November he kind of launched.This and so I'll share my screen um now.And yes perfect and um so kale if you.Aren't aware is sort of like this I'm.Going to m.Coins kind of asset built on Stellar uh.That Tyler AKA kale pale uh introduced.Um originally uh Enrique kind of created.This uh SCM or fcm uh contract that.Initiated this sort of uh like mining.Competitive sort of asset concept and.Tyler took that and kind of went in a.More teamwork oriented uh kind of.Direction with it so if you aren't.Already I highly suggest you start.Mining some kale it's a lot of fun I'll.Demonstrate it's real easy real simple.If you're not already logged in uh you.Can create a new account I'm actually.Going to cancel that because I already.Have one uh but I'm gonna log in.And I'm presented with this uh oh that.Was the wrong one no it wasn't I'm.Presented with this uh this prompt that.I can plant something and I'm GNA sign.That with my pass key this is a smart.Wallet that I've been given um.To uh to plant and sort of get this.Opportunity to mine some kale.And everybody is kind of in this.Together we're like communally Community.Community Driven mining so to speak sort.Of like a pool if you've ever tried.Actually mining ether or Bitcoin or.Whatever um.And all of the people for about five.Minutes or so uh pull their efforts to.Kind of hash and create this.Like this uh hash that has a certain.Amount of zeros there's a lot of math uh.If you click on Tyler's project.Repository here it'll take you to um his.GitHub where there's all kinds of stuff.Uh about how the math works and um.As a group of people it all yeah um it.All.Gets mathed together and when you work.And then eventually Harvest after a.Block has been uh successfully planted.And revealed I don't know if that's the.Right word um then everybody can Harvest.And you get your kale uh back to you not.Back to you you get kale minted to you.You can automate it with his website and.You don't have to use this website to do.It but it's a lot of fun and it's.Honestly the easiest way to do it um you.C we've got a leaderboard here and you.Can see that uh Bri right here with her.3,000 or so is in the top 10.Congratulations um and yeah it's a lot.Of fun a lot uh a lot of community is.Kind of built up around this and um and.It's a really good time to check it out.And to get involved.The thing that everybody's been asking.Though is like I've got this kale I've.Got in this wallet one and a half or so.Oh I get to harvest one and a half or so.Kale that um I've mined what do I do.With it and up to now it's kind of been.Like not that much like there's not.Really a market for it you're not really.Like selling it and that's kind of by.Design um so what I created I'm.Affectionately calling kale.Fail and Tyler really loves that name.He's super excited about it and um it's.Just sort of a riff a spin if you will.On uh this this kale asset that Tyler's.Put together and so right now it is.Essentially a trading contract and this.Contract makes it possible for you to.Send kale just like his farming site you.Can sign up here uh with a smart wallet.It'll give you a smart wallet and um you.Can put some kale into that contract.Into your smart wallet and then you can.Trade it for right now we've got.Broccoli we've got cabbage we've got.Kabi uh if you don't know the farming.Lingo uh those are all different.Cultivars of the same species of plant.As kale it's like really they're all the.Same thing which is why it's always.Tradable one to one and so I'm going to.Send like a 100 kale let's get some.Broccoli back make the Trade sign with.Your smart.Wallet and then it thinks for a second.And it thinks for a second longer and it.Thinks for one more.Second and 105 kale I mean broccoli now.In my wallet let's do the same thing.With.Cabbage and it's essentially just the.Smart contract is holding on to the kale.In the reserves and you can see this.Update date as the uh transactions go.Through um it's holding it in reserve.And it's minting new vegetables to me uh.Let's do Co Robbie as well I'm going to.Make a trade sign in and I'm going to.Get as many vegetables as I dang well.Please because I need the fiber or.Something I don't really know what.Vegetables are good for but now I'm.Sitting here I've got 100 each is of bro.Oli cabbage col.Robie and the way I designed this.Contract is that it's kind of.Extensible if that's the right word I'm.Not entirely sure um to allow you to.Allow the owner of the Trading Post uh.To update their stock or add new.Vegetables take them away and kind of.Expand and grow as as the.Arises so what I'm going to do here I'm.Going to copy paste this link into the.Chat as well uh and then I'm G to try my.Best to share a different.Window what if I do that and.Present and we can.Do this.One does that work does everybody see.That.Cool NOP that's the wrong I don't want.That okay so the contract works it's.Pretty simple as far it's split into.Like owner customer kind of interfaces.Um and really there's one function for.The customer it's trade right you have.An address for your customer what.Vegetable you want to trade how much of.It and whether or not you're buying kale.Whether you're getting kale out of the.Exchange or if you are getting.Um broccoli or whatever the case may be.And it does it just makes sure that it's.An actual vegetable that we have in.Stock it sets up a couple of clients.Depending on if you're buying kale or.Selling kale um and then it it if it's.Kale that you're buying that means kale.Is going to be transferred from The.Trading Post contract into your own.Wallet it's going to burn the broccoli.Or cabbage or whatever you're Trading.And it's going to transfer from The.Trading Post contract into your customer.Wallet otherwise it's going to receive.As the kale receive the kale into the.Trading Post contract transfer and then.It's going to Mint the vegetable uh into.Wallet but I also have this owner.Interface that allows me to add.Vegetables when I see fit so if you'll.All bear with me I'm going to try this.Without uh having done this before we're.Going to try this real real live I'm.Going to add brussels sprouts Raph has.Been asking for brussels sprouts uh.Since the day I launched this so I.Figure it's probably time to give him.What he wants so we're going to Stellar.Contract asset.Deploy.Source is going to be kale Bale that's.What I call it um.Network is main net and the asset is.Going to be this.Thing that I'm copy pasting right.Now so what you don't know is that.Russell's Sprouts is far more than 12.Characters which is the maximum uh.Amount that can be.Um that can be an asset name so I had a.Real hard time landing on a proper.Abbreviation for what brussel's Sprouts.Should be okay so the asset is deployed.So we will Stellar.Contract invoke source is kale.Fail no yes kale.Fail uh network is main net ID is going.To be.Whatever.This asset contract.Was and we're going going to invoke the.Set admin function new admin is going to.Be the Trading Post contract.Address and the transaction is signing.And.Submitting and then we get transaction.Successful where where is it where is it.True cool I always look for that uh now.We get to add it to our Trading Post F.Contract invoke Source kale fail Network.Main net ID is the Trading Post.Contract and we're going to invoke the.Add.Vegetables function new NOP it's called.Veg doubles.To add because I am real creative.Mattius and we're going to make an array.Of or vector rather of.Addresses if we wanted to do more than.One uh and then we.Invoke simulation's.Okay submission looks like it's okay.Let's go uh back to I know I'm giving.You guys Whiplash with all of.These um window switches okay now we go.Back.Lucky yes the vegetables available are.Now including brussels.Sprouts so I'm going to snatch up some.Of.That BR Sprouts is about the closest.Thing it was my wife's.Idea she actually enjoys brussel sprouts.Which is sin basically but now I am the.First one with my very own Russell.Sprouts be sure to grab some on your own.Um I've got a couple things up next for.Kale fail uh number one is.That it's a pain in the butt to sign up.For kale fail for kale mine some kale.And get some stuff there and then.Also um have to sign up for kale fail.Transfer the tokens do all that before.You can actually do anything so I'm.Going to set up an ad signer kind of.Functionality where you can log in to.Kale fail with your existing kale wallet.I'm excited for that uh should be really.Soon able to do that uh next thing after.That is this kitchen that Tyler and.Jrome have been itching to get a hold of.Uh soon we'll have a salad like nft.Basically just kind of a pretty simple.Like let's trade your Co tokens burn the.Vegetables and and give you a really.Pretty picture of a salad or something.Else I'm not sure what other produce.Related things might be in store um but.Soon after that got in mind for like.More fancier nfts if any of you have.Been around for like four or so years.And remember the smart nfts that Tyler.Put together some maybe interesting.Concepts similar to that but actually on.Soron um and even maybe like Community.Submitted uh recipes or other kinds of.Nft goodness fun things that can be.Voted on maybe and approved and all that.Kind of stuff I'm super open to any.Ideas you guys have or anything that.People kind of generally want to see or.What do you want to do with your kale.Maybe we can make it happen but yeah.That is kale fail in a nutshell.Everybody go have some fun enjoy uh the.AI art that I stole from Tyler's uh site.To begin with and read all of the.Fantastic lore that Bri has put together.Like it is phenomenal all of the like.Five whole chapters like it's a freaking.Novel uh go enjoy.It great great thank you for for the.Presentation and and and actually this.Is a this is a fun game it's fun uh I.Think we all got a little bit addicted.To farming kale uh and and it's it's.Really fun but when you think about it.What what if we take kale and kale fail.It it's actually a defi application.Because it has the elements of a defi.Application it's just gamified a little.Bit and instead of using uh real token.Names or real coin names real asset.Names we're using are you using kale and.Broccoli and brussel sprouts but but.This is actually this is actually a defi.Application and and and as you as you.Are switching between when you're.Trading uh kale for for broccoli uh I I.Hope.A lot of people noticed that you're just.Using pass keys there there was no.Complicated wallet access or anything.Like that just use just Ed the a pass.Key so so this is actually it's a good.Example if if um if developers want to.Uh play around and see what what can you.What can you build on on on on Stella.And with soran and and how is this build.Because underneath all the the the fun.Stuff it is actually a defi application.And there's there's a lot of there's a.Lot of um sorant features like like pass.Keys that's included in this so there's.A lot of learning that goes into.Understanding how this works and lot of.Inspiration and and it's a good uh.Sample project if if you want to learn.More about this so yeah any any other.Fun Tech that I I left out that I didn't.Mention that that you can learn from.Looking at the the source code here yeah.The source code is definitely here like.Available on the kale fail site like.Easy to get to.Um it's a spelt kit application if.You're like into front-end libraries and.Frameworks and stuff that's just kind of.How my brain works to build in that um.But to your point that everything is.Pass Key powered like this contract this.Smart wallet that I have CB WN whatever.Whatever uh doesn't have to hold like.This space reserve of lumens there's no.Lumens that it holds s in oh it's.$163 sweet um uh it doesn't have to hold.Any xlm to operate on the network.Everything is done through launch tube.So it's like this pay Master service.That really abstracts the gas fees.Sequence numbers transaction envelopes.All the like difficult things about.Building on Stellar sometimes is like.Just taken care of and so like no fees.Come out of this come out of my smart.Wallet.Same is true for when you're mining kale.It's all done through launch tube and.It's just this incredible opportunity to.Use these smart wallets to like just.Have a wallet that you can like hand to.Somebody you don't have to tell them.Like okay now buy lumens from coinbase.And do this to get your wallet set up.It's just ready for users to actually.Use so yeah you you just mentioned.Launch tube and uh maybe if if everyone.Is not familiar with what launch tube is.Can you maybe go into yeah little bit of.Details how you're using launch tube and.What role it plays in this yeah so.Launch tube is a service that we're kind.Of pioneering um to make it easier for.Applications and developers to build um.Applications that use Stellar like when.You are trying to build a transaction.You need a sequence number you need an.Account to pay that sequence number you.Need a balance to pay those fees you.Need a Base reserve held in the wallet.Like one Lumen minimum to like make sure.That your account is active like a.Minimum balance requirement at some.Banks um and all that can kind of be a.Pain for a developer if you're trying to.Get users set up on their wallet so that.They can actually interact with the.Blockchain so you got to either sponsor.Or give them one Lumen to satisfy That.Base reserve uh you have to pay whatever.Fees um for those transactions to.Actually hit the network launch tube.Though is in you get assigned.Transaction from the user using my pass.Key wallet for these examples um and.Then you send that transaction to launch.Tube and launch tube will take care of.The sequence number the fee.Paid all like the developer has to worry.About is getting a like a token with.Valid launch tube credits on it and.That's super easy barely an.Inconvenience if you go uh to test net.Launch tube.XYZ genen it'll give you one for free if.You want a a real life mainnet one jump.Into the launch Tu channel in our.Discord uh or reach out to myself for.Tyler or carsten Chris any of the.Developer Advocates would be more than.Happy to provide you with launch tube.Credentials so that you can start.Building in this same like super easy.Super streamlined.Way I feel like I didn't fully answer.Sorry that's great so yeah I can only.Encourage everyone to go play farm some.Kale uh do some trading get your.Broccoli other vegetables and uh and and.Then go look at the source code because.This this is in this is a really cool.Application it it really shows a lot of.Different features of of Stella and.Soran so go have fun with it and and go.Look at the source code and and learn.How Elliot built this so I think this.Was all we have time for today uh unless.We have a couple of questions I don't.Think we have one but you there still a.For the quick there is an opportunity to.Ask a question.Anybody sweet doesn't look like it but.Uh thank you so much for joining Elliot.It was it was fun to see to see kale.Phil and uh yeah hope everyone is having.Fun with it thank you have a great day.Bye.
