That the Stellar development foundation.When the war in Ukraine started we.Realized there was an opportunity for us.To make a difference.We had already been working with the.Ukrainian government on its digital.Strategy and we realized that the vision.That we have for payment rails on.Blockchain the vision that we've.Implemented along with a lot of our.Technology Partners could really help.People in need.So over the last 11 months we pushed.Hard to make it a reality we pulled.Together our incredibly technology our.Incredible technology organizations that.You'll hear from today to create a.System that shows why the Stellar.Blockchain and its ecosystem combine to.Make something truly special.We navigated months of testing to make.Sure that this was worthy of those that.We are trying to help and Carmen Hutt.Who you'll hear from today planted the.Seed that got the whole thing moving so.We are so grateful to her for her vision.And Innovation and her trust in Building.Together.And all of that brings us to today.The Stellar blockchain Aid disbursement.System is live fully implemented by The.Unhcr Who is delivering digital cash.Assistance to internally displaced.People idps in Ukraine before we dig.Into the specifics I want to share some.Important context.Hash based interventions serve as a.Lifeline to the world's most vulnerable.Populations this need is only growing.Most notably with the start of the war.In Ukraine causing some 7.8 million.Refugees to flee the country.And 6.5 million to become displaced.Within the country.Which pushed the number of forcibly.Displaced people globally to a hundred.And three million for the first time the.Highest number of forcibly displaced.People in history.This disbursement system that we're.Announcing today is designed to help.These people by serving the aid.Organizations that deliver Aid to them.Directly.To tell us more I'd like to introduce.Carmen hat the unhcr treasurer who has.Been a Visionary in spearheading the.Development of this solution since the.Start of this year with the SDF hi.Carmen.Hello hello everyone yes indeed today is.A great day it's it's a it's a big.Step and of many to take yet to come. the solution is live so so that's.Good it's fully integrated and I'm also.Here wearing the the financial the.Financial head so I'm I'm a finance.Professional so we need to ensure that.This solution really meets our high.Criteria in traceability accountability.Making sure that we can actually report.Dollar by Dollar so we are confident.Today that the reporting tool is fully.In place and we can deliver in an.Accountable way so.The solution is life and we have.Basically implemented now in Kiev in.Liebe and in Venezia and more to come. so far so good so it has absolutely.Achieved what we what we wanted to.Achieve.So we're on a we're on a good we're on a.Good path here.As I've said many times internally to.Our team and also I think to you Carmen.You have really pushed us to be better.And to make sure that what we delivered.Was of the top quality so what role does.Cash assistance play in the unhcr.Support of idps and refugees.It obviously plays an incredible role.And it plays a crucial role because it.Gives people really the choice because.We have to imagine any of us if we were.To if we were to be forcibly displaced.You know what we would actually need so.We really need to have you know.Financial inclusion as well so it.Provides and strengthens livelihoods and.Also economic growth it means that.People really have that choice of what.They need and when they need it so they.Have access immediately to to the.Financial ecosystem so that's that's.Really key.And you already touched on a bit about.The the notion of the transparency and.And from and putting your financial hat.On but what are the benefits to the.Unhcr of this system that that we've.Built together.Yeah the benefits are are vast and.Multiple so.On on one side we have instant access it.Provides instant access to the financial.Ecosystems. with with obviously bulk.Disbursements so many many .Beneficiaries can be reached in in no.Time in an extreme Rapid Way.There's transparency so we can we can.Basically .Follow follow the money follow the data.All the time anytime anywhere on any.Device so we have full full visibility.On all transactional. interaction.As I said access is very important so.Access to.To to to to money access to money but.Access to markets as well.And basically for the most vulnerable to.Make sure that they can really survive.Because we're talking about survival.Here.Stability because it's the usdc here we.Are using so that means that any time on.The wallet that the beneficiaries can.Actually carry the US dollar.And it is not obviously it's not due to.Devaluation at this point so they have a.Choice as and when they withdraw.Partially or fully.And it is portable so as people are on.The move they they have access to that.Money all the time as and when they need.It.And there's the cash out so the cash out.Options are very important because it.Needs to be contextually relevant and.The access to money.For survival is crucial through these.Solutions so it's not a hypothetical.Solution it's a solution that is.Contextually relevant and is working.Yeah I love to hear those words we've.Worked together for so long to make this.Happen. you've already touched a bit on the.The notion of the the transparency and.From a financial management and.Reporting is that something that's.Really important not just to obviously.The unhcr as it's doing its own.Reporting but to the unhcr donors.Yes of course so we have we have high.Scrutiny on each and every dollar that.That we get to to deploy .Assistance and Aid in general.The key here is that we need to get. we need to get visibility that we can.Do that reporting so whilst we have data.Available on the Chain we need to make.Sure that we have on time on time.Real time.The the the information available so the.Scrutiny is is is higher is higher than.Actually in kind in kind assistance.In kind would be if we deliver if we.Deliver a bag of rice so the key here is.That every dollar is basically monitored.And reported upon.Thank you so much for that all of these. these these things that you just.Mentioned are so important and have so.Much to do with just the value of.Blockchain but also just the value of.These tools that we've built together .We wanted to share a message from Deputy.Minister bornyakov of Ukraine the.Ministry of digital transformation has.Been supportive of the development of.The solution over the past few months so.We'll go ahead and play that now.Greetings everybody.Ukraine has been fighting for the future.It's Democratic choice and its survival.As a nation.2022 is the hardest year for a country.For 11 months we have been fighting with.A brutal illegal Russian aggression.Almost a year ukrainians have been.Fighting not only for their country's.Survival and sovereignty but also to.Enhance European security and prove that.Democracy is still the most vibrant form.Of governance.Today another biggest shelling of.Ukraine happened.Dozens Iranian drones in the very heart.Of Ukrainian Capital targeting critical.Infrastructure when people were supposed.To be going to work.Today 30 of power plants are destroyed.People have lost their access to the.Essentials electricity and water supply.Russian energy terrorism is a new way of.Blackmailing not only creating but the.Whole world.Russian terrorism isn't related to.Winning over strategic objects this was.Made to scare this track and let's be.Honest to kill ukrainians.Back in 1991 Ukraine chose to be an.Independent sovereign country.And in 2022 we're fighting for a choice.From the early days of fosuke invasion.We realized that we can mean only with.The help of Technologies new approaches.And Innovations.Ukraine is using Cutting Edge.Technologies such as blockchain.Cryptocurrencies nfts and web 3 in face.Of the Dreadful challenges of the.Russian war.And today we can see how embracing.Blockchain technology allow us to scale.Humanitarian efforts in a way that.Wasn't possible before.The United Nation Refugee agency and the.Stellar development foundation launched.A first of its kind blockchain payment.Solution for digital cash distribution.To internally displaced persons in.Ukraine for fleeing ukrainians and.Primarily for those whose Banks accounts.Are in acceptable this pilot project.Providing humanitarian assistance using.A digital wallet based on blockchain.Technology.And will serve as a possible Lifeline.For survival.The project itself is a vivid example of.How blockchain has the potential to.Transform the way humanitarian funds are.Allocated.The use of blockchain Technology allows.To ensure that the most vulnerable.People will have access to funds.Provided in their name in this way.Humanitarian efforts all over the world.Will be strengthened in unprecedented.Way.The ministry of digital transformation.Of Ukraine is grateful to the United.Nations Refugee agency and the Stellar.Development foundation for standing with.The people of Ukraine and doing this in.Such an efficient and modern way thank.You.So Carmen after hearing from from Mr.Bornyakoff and understanding you already.Had a really good sense of the.Challenges in Ukraine why did you.Believe this could be a good solution to.Pilot there yeah.Like like we just heard that obviously.Ukraine is a global lead in the.Development of Technology solution they.Have a wide a white .White companies obviously available.Inside the countries as well so.From from that also the the people.Themselves are very digitally literature.Literate and also the regulatory.Environment very important of course to.Be able to access in a digital way the.Financial ecosystem.And that allowed so the combination on.Regulatory environment and as well the.Technology allows basically to to reach.The people in need as I said before.What is most important to us is.Obviously so you know to implement.Solutions that work.And that are that are basically giving.That Lifeline to people in need so.Ukraine in this sense is is specific and.We would have to see how else we can.Roll out this kind of solution further.In the world.Thank you yes.That's that's great and I'd love to turn.To the technical components that bring.This solution to life key pieces being.Circles usdc the vibrant non-custodial.Wallet and MoneyGram International so.Let me just provide a really quick.Overview of how the funds the flow of.Funds and how they get from the unhcr to.Idps in Ukraine so the unhcr is.Responsible for program eligibility.Beneficiary enrollment and the.Allocation of relief Aid as well as the.Overall protection of the beneficiaries.The unicc serves as the Technical.Solutions provider for unhcr it manages.The back end technology with the full.Internal implementation of the Stellar.Disbursement platform and integration.Into the un's cash and Reporting systems.Making it the first independent instance.Of Stellar Aid assist which is so.Exciting to me the Stellar network is.The blockchain that transmits the funds.And holds the record of Truth with the.Stellar development foundation providing.Technical and programmatic support usdc.Is a one-to-one backed digital dollar.Issued by Circle and it provides a.Trusted digital dollar stable corn.Stable coin for a safe store of value.Vibrant provides the digital.Non-custodial wallet software that.Enables program participants to receive.And store their relief Aid and MoneyGram.International provides hundreds of.Thousands of locations around the world.Where participants can cash out their.Digital dollars into local currency some.MoneyGram locations support Cashing Out.Physical USD and or Euro depending on.User preferences so MoneyGram is.Integrated with several large banks in.Ukraine so it allows for seamless.Digital cash outs to the beneficiaries.Bank accounts from their phone if that's.The way they choose to do the cash out.So now I'd like to invite Dante desparte.From Circle and Anna Greenwald of.MoneyGram International to join this.Discussion and talk about the specifics.Of this innovation.Dante can you speak to the value of.Having a digital dollar as a secure.Store of value in the humanitarian Aid.Use cases like this sure thank you.Denelle it's great to be with you and.With Carmen and Anna here today. this is one of these really powerful.Examples that while it might still be in.The Prototype phase I think is the type.Of innovation that should be in the.Hands of everyone everywhere in no small.Measure when you have disasters and.Humanitarian crises like Ukraine and I.Should point out these types of.Necessities aren't just for conflict.Zones or emerging in developing.Countries but very much here in the.United States in many places the.Movement of money in a disaster scenario.Is often strictly about Supply Chain.Management and Logistics when you have.Trusted forms of money in digital form.Such as usdc and you have blockchain.Networks like Stellar and you have the.Integrations with networks like.MoneyGram around the world you now have.A form of money that can be sent to.People with the instantaneity of the.Internet have the underpinnings and the.Fundamental Trust of the US dollar and.Then have the auditability and the.Corruption resistance of a completely.Perfect transmission medium in the form.Of blockchain networks. and and think about what we're.Improving upon in many cases.Humanitarian Aid disbursements are.Physical pallets of cash delivered to a.Physical air base or a an airport.Somewhere in the world and those pallets.Of cash are nothing short of Honey pots.For corruption bribery and fraud.The type of money we're moving in this.Prototype in this project. is anything but a honey pot for.Corruption bribery and fraud and so I.Think what we've done here in Ukraine.And what we hope to do in other.Emergencies around the world we should.Not forget Afghanistan we should not.Forget. a lot of Forgotten crises around the.World where this type of prototype can.Be very meaningful. should be a part of this new digital.Humanitarian blueprint so Circle usdc.We're all very very proud to be a part.Of this announcement today.Well yeah and I think one of the things.That I've always talked about is just.How important it is to be able to send.The value that you send is the same as.The value that you receive and so what.You guys have built and the opportunity.To be able to leverage a digital dollar.That is one-to-one back this is so.Important I know you guys know this but.To be able to have that to be part of.The solution it just really makes it.Work seamlessly.Absolutely and and the point I was going.To make is is again this is not the.First time usdc has been integrated in.Such a large-scale humanitarian project.A number of years ago. at the height of the crisis in.Venezuela usdc had a very similar.Project to provide for corruption.Resistant instant and audible auditable. peer-to-peer payments for doctors.Across the country supporting the.Pandemic and Disaster Response at that.Time. the the key of course is it's not.Enough to do this once there's so much.Great humanitarian need around the world.And as Carmen said at the outset helping.People in acute scenarios like the war.In Ukraine is one piece of the puzzle.Ensuring that you're advancing. you know material Financial inclusion.Objectives along the way I think is.Also very critical and so we're.Concerned with not only providing people.With no buyers and Spenders Remorse by.Having a trusted digital dollar but as.MoneyGram has provided now you have this.Global on and off ramp so that those.Digital dollars are not potentially.Stranded on your mobile device or your.Phone but they now enjoy a global.Exchange Point all over the world.Through this partnership with MoneyGram.As well and that's a perfect segue into.A question for you Anna this solution is.As much about blockchain Innovation as.It is about how traditional services and.Fintechs are coming together to make a.Difference Alex and I always talk about.The fact that this is really that.Blending of the old world and the new.World and it's one of the things that we.Talk all the time about about how that.Enhancement just really creates so much.Opportunity can you speak to how these.Off-ramps into local currency are.Meaningful for idps.Yeah thank you and first I just want.To Echo what Dante said about how.Thankful MoneyGram is to be part of this.Conversation and part of the solution.With unhcr and Stellar. I think Dante used the word acute in.Talking about meeting the needs of this.Population and I think that's one of the.Places where MoneyGram provides the most.Value is that having these physical.Networks and Integrations with banks and.The licensures needed to do cash.Disbursement it's very time consuming.And so. I think one of the the challenges.Faced with with refugees and with with.Idps is overcoming that initial hurdle.Of getting into the market and so I.Think moneygram's ready-made.Cash disbursement Network that we've.Spent decades building out can quickly.Now be turned into this incredible asset.In this partnership and so again we're.Just so thankful to be here and to get.To utilize that Network alongside you.Guys.We launched the the MoneyGram.Relationship with the Stellar network in.June and to see it not just be live in.180 or so countries globally but to be.Able to be used in this way is for me.Just sort of the reason why I'm in this.Space so I'm so grateful to the support.That we've had from MoneyGram. from and from the the team there.To be able to make this come together. Dante it's obviously been a really.Tough time in our industry with many.Skeptics out there about the utility of.Blockchain this announcement is the.Direct counter to that right.It is in fact a year ago yesterday I sat.In the Senate Banking Committee. having to not only defend the.Activities of circle but in some ways.The entire industry and yes it has been.Not just what we refer to in this.Industry a winter but perhaps an ice age.And at our darkest time I think this.Example today is a good example of a.Bright light. also I would argue a year ago Circle.Announced a broad program known as.Circle impact in which we made a few big.Commitments one of them was that we.Would allocate a billion dollars or more.To minority depository institutions in.The U.S and Community Banks we've done.That the second is that we would launch.A digital financial literacy program.With historically marginalized.Communities and and colleges we've done.That and the third and perhaps most.Important pillar is that we wouldn't.Just sit back idly while Humanity.Humanity suffered or there were dire.Humanitarian crises and I'm again.Pleased to say that when you know unhcr.And others had to make an exacting.Choice about which digital currency.Would be a part of this program that.Usdc was there and so the key for me.Though is these opportunities.Shouldn't just be pilot projects.Humanity and the the need for Disaster.Response requires that we pre-position.These capabilities well before a.Conflict or a disaster strikes and so we.Look forward to partnering with Stellar.MoneyGram the United Nations systems and.Candidly Aid agencies all over the world.To ensuring that these otherwise open.Digital public goods are readily.Available for people everywhere well.Before a disaster strikes and so I think.That's our priority as we look into 2023.And so we could end this otherwise dark.Year on a slightly bright note and not.Not rest on our Laurels that this is.Just a pilot project today this should.Just become a part of a norm all over.The world.Here here and and when we and Carmen.When we talk about. this experience and how we can use.This experience to prepare for future.Crises. what is how do we build these.Solutions so that they pre-exist .Before a crisis event strikes.Yeah preparedness is is key so I think.That this is one step we have a solution.In place and we now need to see how.Adaptable it is elsewhere and it is.There's no doubt but we need to keep in.Mind that these Solutions required to be.Useful with the people at the center we.Serve so in each context we need to look.Contextually what really. you know what are the key key.Criteria to make this happen.And our ultimate our ultimate goal is to.Be able to provide any time anywhere on.Any device.The the benefits so so you know unhcr.Has been in in that business for some.Time so that's what we do.Each time we have we have an emergency.But we always can get better so we need.To build upon upon this these seats I.Think the seats are now in the ground so.We need to we need to make sure we can.We can leverage them sufficiently and. you know at the Baseline we need to.Be able to to follow the money and.Follow the data so so I think once we we.Overcome that then we are we are ready.For for any disaster scenario. also a key a key ingredient is the.Regulatory environment so we need to.Make sure that each and every.Jurisdiction.We understand what we can do because we.Are not we are not essentially in the.Business to to run a parallel system.We are here to you know to integrate to.To the financial ecosystem and that.People can go about their lives like any.Of us would would wish every day.So this is this is how we see it to to.Leverage fully the current solution.That is being put in place.I think that's really important and and.Anna I wonder if you could think about.This solution we tried really hard when.We were when we first met with Carmen.And others from the unhcr to make sure.That this wasn't a square peg round hole.And to make sure that we weren't just.Like trying to force blockchain into a.Situation that didn't make sense. certainly we've been working with you.Guys since June and have you seen that.Like this is different than what you.Guys have offered you guys have worked.In humanitarian situations as well.Before. and how do you feel about the way.That this works with respect to the.Different offerings in terms of cash.Versus bank account kind of thing I am.So glad you're asking this question.Because it's something we think about a.Lot at MoneyGram I think what's unique.About this use case is that it.Demonstrates truly the best of what each.Of us have to offer it demonstrates how.You can you can blend and create a.Bridge and it moves us beyond the.Conversation about displacement and for.Me it was never about displacement it.Was always about how do we take the best.Of what each of us have to offer and.Create True Value and so I think this is.Just one of those things where one plus.One doesn't make two one plus one opens.The universe to something much much.Bigger and again moves us beyond the.Conversation about displacement and and.Creates a model hopefully for other.Other parties like ours to see that.There really is this powerful.Relationship that delivers value and we.Can move Beyond seeing one another as.Competitors or displacing Technologies.Yeah Alex likes to say that he's been.People have been trying to disrupt your.Business for the last 50 years we're.Actually trying to get your business and.To use all of the tools that you've.Built to be able to bring good to.Everyone. Dante you have spent the better part.Of your career really focused on .These kinds of issues humanitarian Aid.And spending time really for the folks.That are in the most need when you look.At the tools that we're offering here.Today. how do you see this as different from.What you've done before.Yeah I mean for one this is no longer an.Abstraction and I cannot say enough.About how grateful I am to Carmen and.The unhcr for having had the courage of.Of trying to build something that is is.Not a a science experiment but rather.That is in deployment so I spent a.Number of years on FEMA that's the U.S.Emergency Management agency's National.Advisory Council a number of years in.The insurance industry and I am myself a.Disaster displaced person when Hurricane.Hugo destroyed Puerto Rico in the late.80s along with it went you know any.Semblance of normality in my life and.So when speed matters most friction.Stands in the way and moving money in.Analog forms is stands in the way.Remember here in the United States we.Moved more than six trillion dollars of.Taxpayer-funded money to everybody in.The country and so much of that money.Was ultimately lost. enough to fund the totality of the UN.Sustainable development goals I should.Point out in no small measure because.The the pipes are Antiquated they're.Leaky they're back here looking and.They're plagued with opacity the form of.Money that we're talking about here and.The form of integration that we've.Designed together with Stellar of course.With MoneyGram is a form of money that.Is auditable portable and ideally.Universally usable.If you and I were going to do this with.Physical cash it wouldn't work and.Ironically in the context of a pandemic.Like covid-19 it would be as limited as.Our arms can stretch and would have all.Kinds of other limitations so this is.Not meant to be a substitute Innovation.Is just meant to provide additional.Levels of financial support and.Humanitarian support. and so I'm excited for what this.Prototype means and how this can be.Deployed including frankly domestically.Here in the United States.I think it's really important by the way.I've been monitoring the comments to see.If there are questions we have just a.Few more minutes if anybody wants to add.Some in there. the one of the things I was going to.Say is the Simplicity of which this.Works where the the individual the.IDP receives a text message to download.The wallet and then they can they know.That they have the opportunity to.Receive aid from the unhcr and it.Immediately gets put in their wallet.Using the technology there's actually a. a blog post that we have up on our.Website that'll explain the the.Technical back end of how this all.Happens this is really what you say in.Terms of getting to sort of the heart of.The issue and sort of changing the.Dynamic. really and just created an.Opportunity for the to put the power in.The hands of the IDP and I think in this.These situations they don't feel that.They have a lot of power but this allows.Them to choose to cash out to hold their.Value to cash out a part of their value.That that type of thing so it's really.Exciting there is a question here and.And this probably goes to you what is.The kyc requirement on the recipients.And who is in charge it's both unhcr and.Anna Anna you can start yeah sure I'll.Start so kyc we're talking about a.Global solution and kyc requirements.Differ around the globe but I'll speak.Specifically to you crane. like we mentioned a couple times our.Relationships in Ukraine are are.Primarily with banks and so.Both us and the bank we require the the.Consumer to have identification that.Proves that they're the person who.Should be receiving the funds. and so along with that their name.Their address their phone number. is what's required to be KY seeds in.Person.And Carmen you are the the unhcr is the.Entity that actually determines the.Beneficiaries. that are receiving the the aid from.The unhcr exactly so unhcr is in charge.Of registration enrollment eligibility.Determining how much everyone will.Ultimately receive.So unhcr is not performing the kyc so.It's it's it's the financial service.Provider at the cash out that is.Performing kyc.Yeah.Well we are at time. thank you all for joining this has.Been such a great announcement and it.Makes me feel like this year all that.We've worked for together collectively.Is just so worth. this kind of thing coming together.Before the end of the year so thank you.All for supporting the work and for.Joining us in this journey and we want.To continue this is not just going to be.The only thing that we do together so so.Thank you again thanks for joining today.And thanks for the work that we've done.Together here.Thank you.
