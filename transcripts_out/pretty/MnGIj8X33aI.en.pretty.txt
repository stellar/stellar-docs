Life okay we are live I'm gonna give.This just another couple seconds to let.Everybody get settled and then we will.Get started so thanks everyone for.Joining us.Okay I think I'm gonna go ahead and get.Started here all right.So hello everyone thanks for joining.Wherever you are in the world my name is.Lisa nester and I work on the ecosystem.Team at the Stellar development.Foundation and today I will be your.Moderator for our first ever virtual.Roundtable where the focus of our.Discussion will be on a new sub proposal.That focuses on what we call.Send/receive.Transactions so we'll dive more into.This and certainly all of the details of.The send/receive proposal however first.I'll give a quick outline of the agenda.So I will begin by providing a quick.Introduction to everyone about what a.Stellar SEP is and this dollar set.Ecosystem will then move to the.Send/receive depth discussion providing.A short overview of the purpose of this.SEP as well as decisions that have been.Made today and then we will open it up.To our roundtable participants to start.Having a discussion and sorting through.Pending details then at the end we will.Also try and leave some time for Q&A.From any anybody who streaming in and.Participating this in this discussion as.An audience member so please feel free.To add any questions on the the youtube.Question chat box as you'd like so go.Ahead and dive into things what is a.Step so a SUP is a Stellar native term.That stands for a Stellar ecosystem.Proposal and so steps are publicly.Created open source documents that live.In a github repository and facilitate.The creation and eventual adoption of.Technical standards within the Stellar.Ecosystem these are standards above the.Core protocol layer so these are really.ECos.Some level proposals and standards so so.Provide a kind of short overview subs.Are really a dynamic way of introducing.New standards to the protocol for the.Ecosystem above the Stellar Network so.These are things that really helped to.Develop use cases that are being.Implemented and tested by companies and.Individuals across the Stellar ecosystem.And as new ideas or kind of new use.Cases are developed they can be.Introduced in the form of a set to start.Creating technical standards and.Adoption across the ecosystem and it's.Worth noting that you know steps within.The cellar ecosystem much of them have.Been inspired by the IETF just to give a.Quick view of the SEP overview process.For anyone that would be interested and.Doing this themselves or getting more.Involved in other steps that are being.Introduced so this really starts with an.Introduction or kind of initial.Discussion so there's a use case there's.A type of transaction or you know a type.Of operation that someone wants to do in.The Stellar ecosystem and there's not.Really a standard easy way to implement.This so they will reach out and and.Start kind of talking with other people.An ecosystem including SDF to get a.Sense of other people would have a.Similar desire they see a similar need.And also to get feedback on kind of.Other other iterations of how that use.Case might work after those kind of.Precept discussions happen then an.Actual step is drafted and so you know.This usually comes in the form of a pull.Request and the github repository at.That point there's a lot of continued.Discussion further iterations and.Merging of the proposal itself which.Then will actually get changed into a.Formal draft. once that draft is developed then it.Will kind of go into an awaiting.Decision on standpoint where it's tested.And implemented but there's a period for.Final comments to be submitted by other.People in the ecosystem that are using.With the SUP and it's kind of very early.Stage on once that kind final comment.Period is closed the step officially.Becomes active again this is still you.Can think of as a very early period.Where the stuff is finalized but there's.Still kind of testing an early stage.Implementation of it and then once we.Feel a step is really robust we call it.We move it to a final phase where it.Becomes a full standard within the.Ecosystem so just to give reference.Right now for this conversation we're.Still in this kind of merging and.Further iteration so there was a.Proposal that's been drafted and so.We're now reviewing that and so you know.I think to look at the big picture subs.Are really a ecosystem each sorry steps.Are really a tool to ensure that we're.Facilitating an open financial network.They create standard and uniform ways.For different types of assets or.Applications to interface with the.Stellar ecosystem and underlying that is.An ability to create interoperability.Across various applications wallets and.Assets across Stellar so they're really.A critical part of facilitating an open.Financial Network just a quick example.Is sub 24.Deposit and withdrawal or anchored.Assets and wallets and the Stellar.Ecosystem so this is a very it's an.Active set and it really has provided a.Way to improve user experiences across.Wallets for users to be able to deposit.Them withdraw balances across many many.Different anchor tassets.And it also ensures asset compatibility.So as an anchor or somebody issuing an.Asset I can make sure that if I use the.24 the others.Twenty-four wallet or application in the.Stellar ecosystem will be compatible.With my my asset so very valuable in.That sense hmm moving into the actual.Round table I'll quickly introduce our.Participants we have three companies.From the Stellar ecosystem which will be.Speaking during this roundtable we have.Anthony from tempo money transfer.Who's calling it from France we have.Erasmus and Andy from Satoshi pay we're.Calling in from Germany and we have boob.Emmy who is from Calvary System and.Calling in from Abuja so yes from Lagos.I'm sorry I apologize for that.And finally we have Michael who is one.Of our lead integration engineers at STF.Who will be kind of taking the lead and.Help to facilitate this discussion for.The participants so transition into this.We can kind of start by providing a.Quick overview of what this send/receive.Stuff is focused on doing and we've had.To date so with that I will hand it over.To Michael all right cool thank you this.Time so what this is trying to achieve.We already have two steps for wallets.Pinker interoperability so this is kind.Of a unilateral thing where it's one.Person trying to withdraw into their own.Real world Bank the the point of this.Step is to facilitate payments between.Two different people so as far as the.Actual users are concerned here it'll.Just look like I'm sending money into my.Other person's bank account this is.Going to be facilitated usually by two.Anchors who actually have relationships.With each other and ideally there will.Be a a dense network of anchors in all.Different regions so you could send to.Anywhere in the world but the important.Part is that it is between two different.End-user individuals so our use case you.Know for example business.From Nigeria to Europe and this is.Something that Kerry and temple have.Already started working on and have kind.Of used some of our older steps to to.Make this work and ideally we're gonna.Have a more clear actual explicit step.For this so that when other you know if.A third party a third acre comes on they.Can have a business relationship and.Then just plug in and not have to do.Technical integrations or not have to do.Anything complicated it's already gonna.Be built so we've made some decisions.Already you know nothing nothing final.This is all I'm just trying to put.Something out there so we can talk about.It it looks a lot like step 6.Mostly because what we've seen from.Other anchors we've seen from Temple and.Calgary is that step 6.Technically seems to work for a lot of.This the shape of the API what it offers.Really it seems to work so I didn't want.To reinvent the wheel and make everybody.Jump through hoops so what I did and you.Can see in this this draft PR it.Basically takes something that looks.Like SEP sticks.Create a separate end point for it and.Clean up a few things so we took out the.Usage of step 12 and step 12 is a.Customer info server so this is a way of.Sending it's an endpoint just for.Sharing kyc information between two.Anchors and originally we used this and.What we thought is it just makes the.Flow more complicated it's easier to.Just send the customer info with with.The first call anyways so I'm gonna walk.Through do you mind if I share my screen.Lisa okay I'm gonna do it.Has anybody here some experience with.Step 12 because to be honest I had not.Seen it they come up in many.Conversations previously yeah it's.Something that you know I'm curious so.That's one of the things I want to ask.About it is do people feel like step 12.Is necessary is it useful and helpful or.Does it just kind of redirect some some.Usage and complicate this story yes.We've implemented cent well personally I.Think it's useful I like it.It goes back to that original goal of.Having and what it's experienced such.That you can do kyc once you can have it.Stored in the wallet and then any new.Anchor going forward you can be sure.That you have done the KYC them so I.Think it's useful in that respect it.Really helps to use the experience that.You can do kick the questing once and.Then they can have their one of it to.Manage the KYT anything you anchor who.Comes online afterwards that user is.Sure that they can do okay I see with.Latin America I just absolutely control.But it's in German that's my proposal.Wouldn't you still have a new anchor.Comes on board wouldn't you still have.To redo that kyc with the new anchor yes.But the idea is or my concept is you can.Help you want it actually strong kyc.Information once right Amanda when a new.Ad comes on board you can share that.Already stored kyc information with the.New haircut finest set well does that.Make it easier so actually let's let's.Come back to this I'm gonna walk through.How.Works so we can also be on the same page.They see audience aware what kyc means.So kyc is essentially you know your.Customer this is information firm ation.About people trying to send or receive.Money this can be simple as name or it.Can be as complicated as we need a photo.Of your passport with me a photo of your.Face holding your passport that kind of.Thing so it it can get complicated at.Times.Well some of the my toast be stricter.Requirements and businesses and I know.Your customer there's also know your.Business right and then we really start.Opening out from Pandora's box and so it.Really is a diverse topic can you guys.See this separate now I'm confused as to.What's happening with missing plane yes.Yeah so I'm just gonna walk through what.The step we have currently is so at the.Highest level there is you know this is.Something that creates a product between.My brother's already to end-users and.It's facilitated by two businesses that.Have rails between each other so these.You know one of the differences between.This and something like step 6 or step.24 is that this is not a discoverable.Protocol any anchors that are going to.Be involved in this any rails are.Created they have a relationship up.Front so it's not like someone can just.Pop up and say now I'm an anchor in.Saudi Arabia and you know get money sent.To them without without someone agreeing.That they're actually a real real.Business so in this example we had Ellis.In Nigeria who wants to send money to.Bob in Europe so she Alice will sign up.With Nigeria pay to make this payment.Reading about Bangkok Bob doesn't need.To know anything all he needs to do is.Make sure that Alice knows his bank.Account information so she can actually.Deposited so Oh looks like they used the.Word calorie instead of Nigeria pay I'll.Change that but basically this Nigerian.Anchor has a relationship with someone.In Europe Europe a and then they will.Use this protocol to actually transfer.The money and tell Europe a where to.Deposit the money into paws bank account.So the actual protocol only happens.Between the two anchors everything that.Happens outside of the two makers.Communicating is not part of the SAP we.Don't need any protocols for that so.When when Nigeria paid on boards Alice.And collects all of alice's information.This is just a web app or a mobile app.There's no interoperable protocol here.So we don't want to try to define too.Much only the things that have to do.With part parties interacting with each.Other my listen I just asked you I you.Know looking at the feedback at the.Moment or on github I'm just on your.Screen I'm looking at the github at the.At the markdown and the github just just.Wait wait a second are you on this what.You're seeing what I'm highlighting.Right now yes okay I'm sorry.Yes I'm looking at this why is this okay.I'm sorry I was looking at the wrong.Screen I had a second screen up so this.Is what I just described there are so.Here's how this actually works there.There are four entities there's a.Sending client and the receiving client.These are the actual people or.Businesses sending money and receiving.Money and then the sending and receiving.Anchor so the sending client will set.Sign up with the sending anchor tell.Them they want to send money to Europe.The sending anchor will decide who their.Anchor is in Europe send the send the.Tokens over.And then the receiving cur will deposit.Into receiving clients Bank when these.Rails are set up each anchor is gonna.Find a counterparty who would ever reach.Anyone operate with and they're gonna.Trade public keys so that we can use.Step 10.Than step six in step 24 where we use.Sep 10 to the anchors.It's the anchors proving who they are to.Interact with each other this is not a.Sub time for the end user so when we.Sorry okay when we do all the onboarding.And when we collect all the information.For the transaction this happens out of.The scope of the spec and so the the.First time to anchor the sending anchor.Will collect the amounts the any kyc.Information about the sender or the.Receiver that they that they need the.Bank count information where it's going.And then that's when the actual.Initiation happens of the protocol so I.I just got a message from someone asking.If you could zoom in a little bit it's.Hard to read awesome is it.I also we're gonna link to this repo.Specifically in the YouTube chat so.People can go on that directly as well.Yeah someone could drop that into the.Chat.I couldn't comment from my seller.Account that great so so this is where.Things start to look a little familiar.So now that the sending client has.Cleared the Sun Waker when it wants to.You we can start this protocol advanced.So basically the sending client is going.To choose their destination region.They're going to say I want to send this.To Europe and now this sending anchor.Says okay I know who my my Europe anchor.Is I'm gonna look up their Tamil file to.Get their their sensor for API endpoint.I'm gonna look up their infant.To see what fields they need so this is.Very much like the steps except 24 in.Phone point they're actually just a SEP.16 point where it'll say you know I can.I can do a direct send for euros and I.Need these fields I need bank account.I need routing number I need first and.Last name of the sender first and last.Name of the receiver and using the.Information I can make sure that as the.Sending anchor I've collected all that.From my my sending client and if I.Didn't you know that's the second page I.Can collect whatever I need so once I've.Collected all that information I'm.Making a post request to this send.Endpoint so this is very much like the.Posts deposit post withdrawal of step 6.And so it's so late so this is where we.Were talking about step 12..Instead of using step 12 to to send the.Customer info separately we're looking.At sending it all in one request so this.Is just a single atomic request that.Says here is what I want to send here is.All the customer information and if I'm.Missing something rather than say rather.Than the receiving anchor tell me that.Oh you need to step 12 me some other.Info they just say I also need the.Sender's last name and I will just try.The whole thing again with the extra.Information so the receiving anchor will.Just reject this send call until it.Contains everything needed to do the.Transaction and once that's ready once.Once the sending anchor has sent.Everything to receiving achenes we're.Gonna get back the all the payment.Information so now assuming that the.Sending anchor has collected the fiat.However that's going to happen from a.Semi client it can do either a path.Payment to send the receiving anchor.Whatever it expects so a three-c maker.Is expecting to deposit euros the.Sending anchor should send the receiving.Anchor euros either via path name.Or via you know a regular payment where.They've exchanged it however they want.But as long as the sitting anchor.Receives what they expect then the the.Set part is basically done the receiving.Occur should uses that bank count.Information that was sent with the send.Call do the deposit and then from then.On there's just the standard transaction.End point where the sending Aker can.Check on the status to make sure.Everything is going correctly and so.Yeah that's the general flow of this so.A few things I want to ask about were.You know a the SEP 12 stuff be the idea.Of refunds is a kind of an open question.It's something that should be very rare.But in the case of a bank you know once.Once the receiving anchor receives the.Tokens if they can't actually deposit.Into the receiving bank account we need.To know what happens there so there's.This part of the set where we actually.Describe what this is or is this.Something that happens outside of this.Back where if it's a very rare thing you.Know you just communicate with each.Other since you have relationships with.Each other yeah before I go any further.Does anyone have any comments or.Questions on what I just talked about.Sorry if that was a lot I'm sorry for.The confusion earlier on the screens.So let me ask about this f12 stuff then.If the value of step 12 is knowing that.I can just send I can store the customer.Info and send it to whoever else isn't.That still the case here where the.Sending Aker collects the kose.Information for whoever it is they can.Store it forever because that sending.Client has create an account and they.They send it over via this this descent.Endpoint doesn't that functionally give.You the same thing as using except 12.I think we need to make some definitions.Is useful for an onboarding process like.A registration process this particular.Call is not it's not for onboarding this.Is like an actual transaction basically.Meaning it can be called many times so.In terms of just getting the required.Information it makes sense the way you.Describe it my book that gave her all.The information is already complete.Because this is for an actual.Transaction and if there's anything.Missing.Receiving a kit can immediately reply.And by saying these are the fields.Missing in each these fields and that.The sending actor can we try to.Transaction the this makes sense in the.Context of actually sending transactions.Whereas set 12 is useful is actually for.Onboarding and the main differences on.Body requires identity documents writing.This particular transaction this.Particular end points are referring to.The same doesn't necessarily include.Identity documents right it's more like.Personal information which would be the.Receive this name receivables bank.Information but do not hide entity.Document sir this is useful in the.Context of a transaction which is.Repeatable recep 12 is useful for an.Onboarding process and where identity.Documents are extremely so one is it one.Of the things that retama early on is.The idea of what is part of the sap and.What is not so step 12 is really useful.Where you're onboarding to a service.From a product that's not run by the.Service so this is really good for using.When we head step 6.If you have a third party wallet that.Wants to onboard with an exchange SEP 12.Is really important because this lets.The exchange collect information from a.Wallet where the exchange is not.Controlling the UI in this case you know.Calorie controls the UI for onboarding.So you you can use step 12.If you want but you don't have to do.Since since the party collecting the.Information and party displaying the UI.Is the same product there's not really a.Need for an interoperable if I think.That's the the key distinction is that.If there's no two parties interoperating.There's really no need to define a set.Michael could I ask you that a little.Bit more just kind of definitional info.On SEP 12 we've referenced it it's you.Know yeah so step 12.A customer information transmission.Protocol basically what it is it's an.Endpoint where you can post customer.Information so let me start over the use.Case so what like like I said earlier.The use case is I'm an exchange and.There's a wallet that wants to do to the.Posits into my exchange for a user I.Need to collect.Customer information from them to do my.Kyc I need to collect personal lastname.A photo of a passport so should be.Pioneer information strings whatever.What this says allows is it says here.Are the fields that I need and here is.The end points that you can post them to.And then the wallet who doesn't know.Anything about the exchange other than.This is where I post the customer info.To can can send information to the.Exchange yeah I mean that's generally.Simple protocol it's you know a lot of.These steps are very simple you know.This is just one endpoint it's actually.Two endpoints it also allows you to.Delete information but it's it's.Essentially just you know it's just a.Standard that says if you're gonna.Collect customer info and you want other.Parties to be able to provide it to you.Here's a here's a standard way to do it.With no no UI or the UI is up to the.Product itself we don't say anything.About it but can I ask so I don't I.Don't have a lot of experience as I.Mentioned with this approach but the.There's no way of fetching the raw data.By this correct.What kind of routine what do you mean so.Perhaps I'm an anchor or an entity in.And and I'm being told that somebody has.Been chaos eat but for whatever reasons.Regulatory compliance I may need to run.My own kyc again I would like to fetch.The raw data if we have some sort of.Agreement between these two entities.That we call so like share the data of.Course in a compliant manner then I.Would I would also want to fetch that.Raw data the identity documents the.Identity identity of the natural person.All the documents I have uploaded so.This so the way that we imagine is.Happening now is you know remember the.First step of the actual protocol here.Is we have this info endpoint which I.Think a lot of people are familiar with.Subsection 724 this basically this is.How an anchor will kind of advertise.What it supports so this is an anchor.That says I support receiving US dollars.Here's my fee information and what.You're asking about here is these fields.So this says if you want to do a.Transaction with me I'm gonna need the.Sender's first and last name the.Receivers first last an email and these.Can be any number of kyc fields.Including things like passport photo or.Something and then the information.Regarding the transaction so this is.This is another way that we we kind of.Diverged from step six a bit is we.Separated sender receiver and.Transaction information whereas in step.Six it's all just fields and that works.Because there's only one party you know.With this there's there's two parties.There's a sender and receiver so I guess.First off does this so actually there's.There's two ways one is this way the.Info on point says here's the fields I.Need you want to interact with me you're.Gonna have to send me this data the.Second way is if you're doing a some.Someone's echoing if if you're not.Talking could you sorry.If yeah so if you have a transaction.That's particularly particularly.High-value you might say oh you know I.Originally I said I only need first last.Name but I actually also need passport.Photos now and that's where you would.Reject the first end call and say you.Know I need more information.I need this as well and then the sending.Anchor would have to collect that and.Send it to you as well.Does that answer your question about how.You would get that data from the sender.Yeah I mean my question was more about.Step 12.Like why it wouldn't be defined then.Also just just I mean at least some.Suggestion so everybody would have an.Agreed standard of also requesting that.Data right there might also be.Interesting if if we looked at sharing a.Compliance data across a network but it.Maybe it's a bit outside the scope of.This conversation if if we're mainly.Discussing this this new direct payment.Proposal so but it was more like more.The direction of a compliant partner.Network so you're saying you want a way.To like kind of just have shared kyc.Ahead of time for everybody rather than.At transaction time yes for example or.Just just that it's sort of the.Separating concerns a little bit so that.In the set 12 that would potentially.Allow a I mean we I'm sort of segue into.A little bit of an absolute discussion.Here but it would allow for a sort of a.An entity that's focused entirely on.Doing compliance would allow them to.Also for example provide an a an.Endpoint that everybody would know how.To consume and where they could request.The data according to certain rules but.But it may be it's really relevant to.This discussion because it would be more.Regarding the set 12 itself so maybe we.Should pick it up and can I say one.Thing Michael yeah of course from a kind.Of European perspective because the.Regulations are changing slightly.And Germany was a leader in this is that.Basically we need liveness tests on all.New registrations and so the whole.Concept of the SEP 12 of basically.Having the data and submitting it to a.Regulated entity in Europe probably.Won't fly simply because we need to do a.Live nest egg on the hologram on their.ID as well as on their face pretty.Principle if they're a sort of a expiry.Date and when that so let's say that.Somebody does that three months ago and.You requested the video recording of.That lioness test somebody sitting in.Front of an agent and holding up their.Passport for example if you know they.Know yeah there's no expiry on the video.When the passport expires we have to.Request a new passport but yeah the.Issues that we as regulated and we have.To do our own kyc even if we're using a.Partner what kind of responsible so we.Can't 100% delegate that we still have.To hold be held accountable so it could.Be good to have a third party and in.Fact there's about three or four like.One if I or some sub or there's about a.Dozen vendors out there will offer this.Kind of thing but passing it between.Companies it can work you just need an.Agreement a data protection agreement.Between the companies like what we.Signed with bid bond where they passed.Us the data they've collected with.German kyc provider and they basically.An API into the into the provider.Exactly so that would be B something.Along those lines and I'm just thinking.That that perhaps at 12 could also.Assist in this sort of sharing a purse.And then work right so yes of course it.Would have to be with a German agent in.Your case for example over the I guess.For the European agent that would have.To do the lioness check that would be.Like very certain my specifications for.Somebody in Europe compared to somebody.In Africa and so on but the.If that independent compliance provide a.Partner they they made sure to take all.The data accordingly right so this is.Combined with this regulation in these.Countries it's not combined with these.If there's a way of signifying that.Right and I could still work and however.I appreciate this really is an axillary.Discussion to the the set it is related.And it's sort of also a little bit.Beyond the scope so it's a very tricky.To know when to stop this conversation.And so I think it is like it's the.Actual mechanics of it are outside the.Scope of the SAP but I think it is.Important to just know that that is a.Use case the idea of having like a.Shared kyc provider so I don't think it.Might not work for everybody but I want.To make sure like I want to make sure.That it does fit into the set if people.Do want to use that so we had thought.About this and I think that I think the.SEP does provide for that so if you have.A kose network you have somebody.Provides you know kose compliance for.You and the way I imagine it works is.Every client has like every end user has.A token that says like this is the user.You can look up on the compliance.Provider and say here's the user here's.The token can you you know provide the.KYC for me and verify that they've.Actually been you know properly vetted.And I think the way that would work is.That in this info endpoint you know we.Would say instead of first name we would.Say senders kyc token that would allow.You to then go back to your kyc provider.And use that token to make sure.Everything's on the up-and-up and.Everything is what you expect as far as.Actually building the KYC network yes.F12 might be a good way to kind of.Facilitate that between each other and I.Think that is a good use case where you.Actually you don't have to do.Proprietary characterizing everybody.Nd I asked you to mute when you're not.Talking I think you're you've got some.Echo going on there oh thank you but do.You think that that so I guess my main.Concern is I just want to make sure that.What the step provides doesn't disallow.I don't want people to have to add.Another ad hoc API to use this kyc as a.Service stuff so just to I mean this is.Something that we're pushing for very.Much I mean we our service it's very.Much in between different entities and.The understood network and one of the.Things that we want to streamline it's.The compliance process so we are we are.Very actively negotiating with the.Compliance as a service provider and.Inclusive and of course is it something.That we hope to achieve so yes I mean we.Would ideally want something on that so.I'm just just to let you know we're also.Doing something where we're just opening.Up we have a partner who was requested.And we just open up an API where they.Can then pull the information Andy maybe.That could be a step as well like a.Standardized way of pulling but they've.Been validated the issue that we ran.Into is every country's got different.Documents they require like we're in.We're working in Cyprus and they require.In France we don't require proof of.Income but in Cyprus they do so it gets.All very complicated very quickly.And and this is why we would we would.Want really want a focused entity to.Working in this that we don't all try to.Set up our own but but this is at least.From our side what we what we what we.Would like to see that we have an entity.Dedicated and Stellar who provides that.Service and also works on standardizing.These and then can go into the.Nitty-gritty of quite figuring out the.Requirements for each jurisdiction and.The different purposes businesses versus.Individuals and so on right and the only.Other comment that I have is that if you.Look at one of the big guys like.Remotely and cosimo they typically do.The became I see at the end meaning they.Receive the payment first and then they.Do the KYC after the payments received.So currently we're not doing that we're.Doing the KYC first where we unset 24 or.We pop up the interactive URL and this.Is going completely off-topic sorry.Because with anchors anchor - anchor.Traffic that's not an issue but I'm just.Saying that with the KYC thing it might.Following on Andy's concept of this kos.Uses services it might happen after the.Payment yeah you could share something.That would be great I mean it's really a.It's really a good it's like it would be.Very valuable for the ecosystem I think.If we would have an open standard there.In time and even if the requirements.Chained are very different between.Countries sometimes it would still be.Valuable in the sense that you don't.Need to start from scratch but just need.To add the data that's missing so I I.Wanted to see I don't know we hadn't.Heard from UPenn me in a while so I.Wanted to see if you have any comments.On this and then also say that I also.Think this is very relevant to this.Discussion would also suggest perhaps.That we kind of make some assumptions.Around how kyc is being collected for.Kind of like a short-term model of how.This anchor - anchor transaction would.Work unless that seems too difficult to.Do just so we can kind of test or.Continue that discussion.Regardless different jurisdictions.Requiring different kyc I just wanted to.Ask isn't it up to the receiving anchor.So it's the receiving uncle who would.Always determine what the requirements.Are so if you're in Cyprus but you are.Sending through tempo therefore tempo.It's what tempo requires so in this.Particular situation you're you're.Standing from Cyprus but the.Requirements would be tempos requirement.Which means they don't need to think.About such situation yeah I just wanted.To ask about receiving Anka who.Determines what is required normally we.Do the KYC on who's sending the money so.With the case of you guys we do the KYC.On on cowering your folium the bank on.The on the case of individual client we.Do it on the client so it just depends.On who who is the client in the case of.You guys you are our pot so we do the.KYC on you and then but then because.You're working with a regulated entity.Within Nigeria where you're doing the.KYC in Nigeria and the you passing some.Additional details so we do a validation.Check but the person thought on some.Terrorists list or something like that.In France but we're relying on you and.Your banking partner to do the KYC in.Nigeria on the sender no now now if the.Amounts are a little bit higher like.With you guys typically what we ask for.Additional information not proof of.Income but you know what what's it for.Like proof of the someone sending two.Hundred thousand euro or four hundred.Thousand dollars and this an individual.Normally would better buying a house.We'll need a reason for the wire and.Then maybe proof of the purchase of the.House or with a company.Does need an invoice for the your.Company might need to send an invoice.And that's not relying on us that's.Often our downstream banks that require.That or our internal compliance officer.Yeah so my question is that in this case.Temper we have to follow the template.Requirements so it's not determined by.Requirements that might country you as.The receiving anchor you are responsible.For determining what kyc used to be.Censored this question of different.Jurisdictions I went what I'm trying to.Get out of is the receiving honker.Always wins is to receive an actor who.Determines what kyc is required so.Therefore it's always receiving I'm.Christa jurisdiction as it doesn't.Matter what the standing occurs.Jurisdiction came I see to require okay. I think but in any event I think this.Flow works for us Michael when I talked.To you last there was some information.Like the how would this work for a cash.Transaction like a cash out and the.Second one was a rename like if the.Person that the receiver name was wrong.And they needed to change it or the bank.Account was wrong yeah so so in the case.Of if some of the information is wrong I.Think what we do is.We just have an arat we just error it.Out so with a with an area that says you.Know the bank account is not a valid.Bank account or something but what.Happens if it's after after tempo like.It's a downstream thing we sent it to.Our bank and maybe the bank at the other.End rejects it because it says account.Number invalid so okay yeah that's that.Was one of my big questions I want to.Ask is how rare is that case and is that.Something we want to make part of the.Spec so I could imagine a case where we.Have you know the this thinning anchor.Might say if anything goes wrong send.The money back to this Stellar account.And we'll essentially reverse the whole.Thing this this creates bank accounts I.Don't think we have a lot of errors but.We do with a cash so if someone sitting.To a cash transaction is a synagogue or.Philippines.We often get like I mentioned last time.Things about three to five percent of.The transactions the person puts the.Wrong cuz then it might person might.Have a middle name might have like three.Or four names and so the sender puts two.Of the names and so when they get person.Goes to pick up the cash their passport.Says the whole five names and so they.Have to call us or contact us and then.Do a rename okay so this is this is.Where you're acting as the sending.Anchor not as the receiving right and.Then a receiving anchor says let me do a.Little bit of cash out it's not our main.Business but I was more focusing on.Africa don't we do a lot yeah okay.That's yeah that's a big percentage to.Just ever out I think I think just.Airing it out is the well okay no sorry.You can't hair it out because it's.Already sent.Some four is kind of like an update.Payment endpoint or something where.Someone can change after after.Everything is said and done but it.Hasn't been paid out you want to be able.To update something normally what would.Happen is they pull the transaction.Status we'd have it marked as error and.We'd have an error type like it'll be.One of two things it'll be in pending.Pickup or like a waiting for pickup.Status this is cash still and the person.Would do a rename and say okay instead.Of John Mark is John it's John Luke and.And does it renames the last name okay.And so currently this solution that like.Actually exists in the spec is to just.Issue a refund and do it again okay this.This creates problems because there's.Foreign exchange fees values change.Obviously it's definitely not ideal so.Again with our customers they would.Expect it to be the same they'd expect.Exactly it'll be a giant nightmare if.Lifted you'll refund right we do it yeah.Okay then I think that's something.That's missing I think there's something.That's missing here so we need to figure.Out a way for the receiving anchor to.Tell the sending anchor something's.Wrong here's what's wrong and here's how.You can tell us how to fix it if it's a.Fixable thing right so what they would.Probably do is give the reference the.Transaction reference the operation ID.Or some transaction reference that we.Feed them back and then send a.Transaction update call okay and since.The spec doesn't have a way to update.The transaction only to create them.That's probably the missing.Okay ah it's a little more complicated.Because you have to tell the setting Inc.Or something and that's a different.Direction that doesn't really exist in.The specs so far so okay this is good.Information I'm gonna have to do some.Thinking on that and come up with come.Up with a solution but I agree that that.Would make the product a lot better this.Is kind of a big missing thing okay.That's fine have this resolved with the.Transaction and portable so you would.Normally pull the transaction endpoint.To find out the status of your.Transaction so compass be solved with.That endpoint basically when you first.Send the transaction they would return.Something like panting pay up and then.Eventually let's say you call it a.Couple of hours later tomorrow we're at.That point you know there's something.Wrong then it would have an error.Description wouldn't that work yeah I.Think so so the transaction object can.Have like a status you know.Mmm info needed or update eat it or.Something you know we just had a comment.On YouTube from Mariano who said do you.Think an intermediate status could be.Added for all transactions that by.Default status would be pending and then.Change to share that comment and also.Give a five minute warning cool yeah.I think that when you guys well said.Just makes sense have a status needed.Update for transaction and then also.Make it so you can do a plate or a.Update call on the transaction endpoint.To actually change some of the.Information.I think that seems fine one of the last.Things I wanted to ask about while we're.All here is the idea of receiving kyc.What I've been hearing most of is that.There's not a big issue as far as like.To be run kyc on the receiver could you.Guys share a little about what what.Requirements you have about the person.Receiving the money just really.Quickly from a European perspective for.Mittens it's fairly like kyc because.Either we collected directly from the.Recipients like if they come to a store.A physical outlet to pick up cash.They'll provide their ID so we don't.Need anything on the call because we're.Collecting it or it's the bank account.In and European bank account we don't.Need an additional kose information.However if it was a merchant and we're.Doing merchants acquiring which we've.Been looking into then we might need to.Kyc the beneficiary because that in that.Case the beneficiary would be a merchant.But I don't think I think that's out of.Scope for this specification when you're.Acting in as the sender do you ever need.Any kose on on the receiving client when.You're descending anchor occasionally we.Do okay but that's our compliance.Officer would go to their compliance.Officer and typically ask for proof of.The ID but I think it happens it's a.Very rare event okay.But it could come on the transactions.Again like I mentioned if it's a very.Large amount there might be additional.Proof of source of funds or you know for.An invoice or a company or something.Else.We handle that side of expect if your.Receiver kyc doesn't come up much if.It's going into a back then it's all.Handled by the back has all became YC.Initially and it's no it's we don't at.The moment but if it's cash then we.Connected it from the actual we could.Click the KYC from the person who's.Coming to pick up the cash so we don't.Need to rely on okay Anthony you're.Saying that sounds like by necessity a.Very high touch thing it's not something.That can really be codified for cash no.For like a really high value transaction.Where you need proof of funds or.Something is that something that can.Become part of the spec or is that like.You really need a compliance officer to.Be doing this manually for me it would.Be maybe a next version of us of the.Spec again each country is different so.It's a little bit hard to codify it okay.Pending the anchors to it I guess that.Would be done by pending senator pending.Receiver if you're gonna check on.Something that's more complicated so.That that's fine yeah it could be a.Pending receiver and if there was some.Free text or something like this it.Could be good where you say a proof of.Proof of source of funds are proof of.Issa funds required yeah cool I know our.Time is basically over but I just wanted.To highlight that we didn't have the.Chance to talk about the our use case.Yet said is like if it involves a party.That it's not a traditional anchor in.That sense but another business entity I.Don't know do we still have time to.Quickly outline what what what different.Approaches or what what features we.Would need in the in the set and to pull.That off for this special use case maybe.I'm gonna jump in here yes I totally.Agree with you Andy and I think you know.This just means we need to set up more.Of these discussions and more frequently.Or definitely really focused on.Supporting the stuff in your use case as.Well so I think for now we can't extend.This specific session but we can.Obviously continue to extend it offline.And perhaps we'll set up another one of.These in the near future.So thank you all for attending I also.Just wanted to address one kind of.Recurring question that we saw through.Our website and YouTube feeds which was.In regards to like how do you know the.Quality of an anchor or des Stellar or.SDF somehow that anchors as part of its.Network and so I just wanted to make the.Point clear that Stellar itself is an.Open financial network a decentralized.Ledger anchors are enterprises and.Institutions with real world reputation.And oftentimes real world licenses and.Regulations that they're following so.Anchors are vetted by applications or.Other anchors that are going to use.Those services with the mastaba.Ecosystem we have a system called you.Know Thomas which helps to helps anchors.To publish their website information.About themselves their business licenses.They hold but we you know certainly are.Working in both and open but also.Reputational ecosystem on Stellar so I.Just wanted to quickly touch on that and.Again thank everyone for joining this.Conversation is certainly not over so.Perhaps even you know just getting.Started but I think a lot of really.Great insights here a lot of great.Suggestions and so will will follow up.And continue to take things forward cool.Thanks everyone.
