Hello everyone and welcome to this.Week's Stellar Developer Meeting..Today I have a guest from the community.We are doing another one of the.Developer spotlights and today it's a.Pleasure to say welcome to to Panfield.Also known as Tupi.So welcome and thank.You for joining us today.Thanks a lot.For the invite.Really crazy to be here.So I know you've been you've been.Super active in the community for a very.Long time and I see I see you contribute.To our documentation to some of our.Repos.You help out with the Stella.Community funds and help out on on.Discord.I I see your name all over the.Place.So I'm I'm super excited to to.Talk to you today.I I would just really just as before we.Dive into what you're working on and.Your own projects like what the what.The how did you get get into blockchain.And how did you get into to Stellar in in.The way you are because you're very.Involved.Yeah.So I've been involved now with.Stellar like actively for the last two.Years I would say and I really started.To dive into because I when I switched.Company I went to work for a bit ponda.So a crypto broker in Europe one of the.Largest and I told myself okay if I'm.Going to be a developer there maybe I.Need to dive deeper in really a.Blockchain project and because I was a.Maintainer already of many open source.Project in the scientific python.Ecosystem.I told myself, okay, now I.Need to do something and I knew already.Stellar.It was really in the back of my.Head.I I remember still I'm not sure if.It's still on the web page of.Stellar.org, but there was this story.About somebody in Peru having some.Ship and they wanted to tokenize the.Sheep and exchange the ship for.Something else.And this was still in my.Mind and I just found that concept.Fascinating.And so I was like, okay,.That sounds like a real world utility.And something which can have some good.Social impact.And so I really wanted to. to get into that space and that's why.I picked Stellar to to be the my.Platform of choice.And yeah, also at.That time it was just before the Sorban.Started to to be beta and and and.Together and yeah, I wanted to learn.Rest was in Rust.So I was like that's a.Perfect match.So that's how I started.Really to to be active in the community.Okay, that's great. so so you said.You you didn't you didn't know Russ.To before you started working.How.How do how have how have the onboarding.Process to Sorban?
How has that been for.You?
You've been along for maybe a.Little bit longer.So so what is what is.Experience?
Experience?
Experience?
Yeah.So my previous experience was .Purely just Python because I'm a Python.Developer day-to-day job.U so I would.Say I'm a good Python backend developer.So zero experience in front end either.So JavaScript and and all of that and.The documentation was just amazing.Without any prior knowledge to to Rust.Or anything.I had everything that I.Wanted to to have and I also have had.Zero experience in blockchain.Development either. so I knew what a.Smart contract was and the the concept.Of it but I did not know any subtlety.About TTLs and lifetime and all of.That and how you deploy a contract.And and all this this nitty-gritty.Details.I had no clue about all the.Complexity and the documentation was.Just just a breeze to to to read and .And yeah when I had questions which were.Not answered the community was just.Amazing to like the discord and also on.Twitter people are super helpful.So.It's just easy I would say.Great.When when you started working when.You started developing on on Stellar did.You have a purpose?
Was a problem?
Was.There a project you wanted to build or.Did your current project come along.Later?
How how does that happen?
Yeah.Know I at first I really started with.Some I did not have like a a concrete.Idea I wanted.I I had some some toy.Problem that I had in my in my head that.I wanted to to do. maybe some people.In the audience also saw saw some some.Of these.I had an idea with a I had a.Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build .Like a gimmified platform where you.Actually you have a a pump and you use.The you pump and as much as you pump if.You pass a threshold and it's going to.To do a trigger and and to send some.Tokens.So I had something like that .That I hacked away.That was my first.Contract actually and yeah that's.That's what I built first and I even.Made a YouTube video about it. and so.Yeah, I did one idea like that and and.The second one that I did was I wanted.To explore around the tokenization of.Things and make a make a a token and but.Push a bit further.And so there I was.Okay I had this idea of looking at .Live data so weather data and so I was.Looking at the the expansion of the ice.And the contraction of the ice in the.Arctic.And I was like, okay, I'm going.To put that data and use that data to.Either mint or burn a token.And so I.Had sort of an oracle in mind.And so.I built another project like that.And.Building these two project gave me.Some confidence into building smart.Contract interacting with the community.As well.And all everything is working.Basically.I I think that I think.It's a really good way to learn like.Build something fun, something maybe not.Super serious, but kind of get some.Experience building something that that.You enjoy to do and where you can get.Some user interactions and and see.People enjoy it.So I think that's a.Great that's a great way to to start get.Building something more let's say more.Serious. so can you maybe talk a.Little bit about the project you are.Working on and I know you have a.Presentation as well.We can go into it.A little bit.I think it's super.Interesting to see see what the.Community is building.I guess I need to upload the tech.So, oh perfect.Okay.Yes.So, the.Project I'm building is called Tensu., and so the background of all of that.Is that as I said earlier, I'm a.Maintainer of some famous open source.Project in in scientific Python.So .One of them is called Cypi and Cypi is.Downloaded close to 100 millions of time.Per month.So it's it's really huge.It's really one of the powerhouse of.All the scientific Python tools like.Packages like a psychic learn if you do.Some AI or PyTorch behind the scene they.They leverage these tools.I've been a maintainer of this this tool.For like five years or something like.That and also deeply involved here in.The in the open source world and so I.Know the challenges that the maintainer.Face are facing and also I know also the.The struggle that can come to into using.The the software and I wanted to try.To solve some of the problems that I've.Seen by building a tool which is sort.Of interacting with with GitHub.So I'm.Not envisioning to replace GitHub at.All. because I think GitHub is is.Nice to store the the code and.Everything but I think we're missing on.On two key areas which are first of all.The security because I think in in.GitHub now they're building tools around.Security and and around securing the.Supply chain and because when you're.Building something on GitHub at the end.Of the day what you want to to ship is a.Software and artifact and GitHub now has.Tools in order to to secure a bit all of.That and to ensure the provenence and to.Ensure that the code was not altered and.Things like that.But I think there's.Still like a long way to to go into.Really fully secure that.And the other.Aspect which is the aspect that I I.Wanted to to really cover with my.Tool when I when I started to to build.It is the community aspect. I'm.Saying that because as a maintainer of.Of of a big tool like that, how is the.Typical workflow in the governance going.Is that you have a mainly list and .You post your idea on the main list and.Sometimes it's sitting there for years.And maybe somebody's replying and and.Saying oh you have a good idea or not.And then there's a bunch of.Discussion happening it's never fair.It's never really transparent there are.A lot of background discussion happening.Lot of lobbying and I wanted to have.Something which allow the committee to.Be a bit more transparent to have a.Ways to to really push ideas and have.All the ideas evaluated in a fair.Manner, transparent manner and so so.That's really on the idea side and the.Community side and another point that.People also may may know about free open.Source software is the the free aspect. it's a double edged world in the.Sense that there's a lot of people who.Wants to to build this software they.Are dependent the pond but then at the.End of the day we have a limited.Amount of time.We all have jobs and .It will be better it will help if you.Will get compensating sometime for for.The the effort and that you put into.This software and some big project like.Scypi we do get some some funding so.It's it's very modest I have to say .Right now in the bank account of scypai.Maybe there's around.$100,000 and that's a software which is.As I said used by millions of user.Around the world really dependent upon.And there are 30 maintainers ers active.On the project.So it's huge and.Something like 100k is not doing going.To to help anything.You can you can.Barely hire one or two two developer.Fulltime if you wanted to and that's the.Budget we we managed to get after 10.Years of funding or something like that. so there's really limited budget and.And also the way it's being collected.And distributed it's not very.Transparent.And so with tonsu I want to.To have tools in order to be able to.Distribute this money a bit more fairly. because now when you would get a.Grant for instance maybe you split the.Grant into some principal investigators.Or two or three people but what about.All the people reviewing your code .Contributing to all this discussion and.Everything there's a lot of people.Who are left aside there and I want.To try to to have tools a bit for for.That.So, Tanu is just a platform on top.Of GitHub which is the goal is to.Help with putting really.Decentralization back into Git..Because yeah, GitHub is one this this.One giant platform which is very.Centralized.You push your code on it., but then if tomorrow you you're not.Happy with the state of the world or.Something, you can decide to change your.Code there.And this can have drastic.Consequences on on on all the people.That that depends on you because on.GitHub, you can just force push on the.Main branch.There is not much history., if you don't monitor it, you won't.Know that anything happened and you can.Really break people there., same goes.With the community.You can really .Not listen to what what what people are.Saying.you can push in electoral.Decisions and things like that.Nothing.Is really fair.And so here I want to.Have tonsu which really gives the.Community a voice and also have.Decentralized organization basically.That allows to do specific actions in.A in a trustless manner.Basically and yeah by the way if anybody.Has any questions I'm not sure I see if.There is anything in the chat so far but.Yeah feel free to to stop me.Yeah, I.Don't see any questions so far, but .Yeah, anyone who has questions, feel.Free to ask in the chat.Perfect.Yeah, we'll soon drop to a demo that.Will be.There.And so so okay, what is Tanu.Today?
So Tanu so far received .Funding from from SDF two funings. which allow to to build the following.So on the left side.So a smart.Contract and a DAP which are on test.Net. I also managed to build a.Decentralized organization.So from.Scratch I'm not depending on on.Anything.The only thing I'm depending.On which is a gra project it's a roban.Domains.That's my way to sort of .Prevent people to abuse a bit the.System.I force people when they.Register the project to have a solar.Band domain for their project.And so.This way you have a collateral for the.Project itself and if people abuse and.Create too many project we can deal with.That with with bandan domain. and.Then I added some some features to .Start to give some money to project.This is the support feature. and on.The security side I have this commit the.Hash on chain which I will I will show.Later what I'm working on right now.I'm actually I have an open pull request.To add anonymous voting to the system.I.Believe that would be the first.Anonymous voting platform on on on. so I'm pretty excited about. everything's working. on the.Smart contract side basically right now.I'm just reworking a bit the the the DAP.Itself to make it work. so I really.Hope to have that out.I don't know.Maybe in one week or two weeks.Because yeah the the front end side as I.Said I'm not a front end developer.I do.Have some help from a front end dev and.Yeah because I have the day job it's.It's a bit hectic and sometimes I have.To to push some nights to to try to to.Push things but it's getting there. I.Have another friends actually who's.Helping me on the on the next point.Critical vulnerability analysis and.We want to push all.This information on chain and to link.This information with the state of the.Project. and same for the the res.Artifact.So adding more features.Towards the decentralized part .Decentralized organization part and also.To the security part. that's the.Focus right now. yeah that's just a a.Quick road map that that I have in.Mind.So as I said I had SCF award.Which all to kickstart all of that.We build I built all that in one quarter.Basically to to have the the first.P and to be on test net.So was pretty.Fast because I had really a clear.Idea what I wanted to do. and now I'm.Really in this SCF build. I already.Finished the first trench.I'm on the.Second trench and I'm beginning to.Collaborate with another great project.Trustful to add a layer on the.Decentralization part.I actually don't.Want to use a token really for the this.For the organization.I want to use a.Trustbased system.It's a bit similar to. how nodes are talking to each other.In the consensus protocol and Stellar. we using trust and here I want to.Also use trust that we place on people.On maintainer and on participant in the.Community.So the more active you are in.The community and the more good.Social impact you make in these.Communities you will get basically.Badges. this is the the concept that.Trustful is is bringing and and with.This you will get actually your voting.Power. so I prefer that over having.Just a monetary incentive u because yeah.Money is lacking.I prefer the money to.Go to a the support of the project.Than than that. there's a question.Like launch to sponsor transaction.Actually have to look into launchship. because to be completely honest, I.Still don't really understand what.Launchship is is fully doing. but.Definitely I see a lot of a lot of.People talking about it and and and I.I hope on the call sometimes to to see.What Tyler is is building and so so.Yeah I will definitely have to look into.Into that to pay tax fees for this.Interaction.So that's the so for.Now I don't put any any premium.Or on any features but that's something.I will need to think about if one day I.Really want to make this profitable in a.Way. but right now I There is nothing.Like and you can see the code everything.Is open source pay master sponsor.And but yeah right now there's.Zero fees and the only way that right.Now tonsu would make any money is there.When you click on the support button.Which I will show you can decide to.Leave a tip to the platform.Right now.There is just.That and yeah that brings me actually to.The presentation of the of the D itself.And if I manage to present the tech.Share screen that's this one.Tech can I share I can share.It.Yes perfect. so yeah you can so the the main.Website of Tensu it's just tensu.dev. here you can find some some rough.Documentation.I'm saying rough because.I have the I'm a back end dev so I my.Tendency is to write code and forget a.Bit the documentation but there's still.Some documentation to to go through to.How to create your new project.Explaining a bit of rational about the.Soran Soroban domain. I also have a.Concept of a tonsu file to describe a.Bit your project.Basically, it's a way.To map your GitHub profile to your. Stellar address.That's one of the main.Feature.And the other feature is just.To give to to to have some.Social link attached to your project.Because I don't want to store all of.That on a smart contract.And u.Something I have to mention is that I'm.Trying everything I can to not have a.Back end at all because I really believe.In.Decentralization and and I think that.That's really what we were trying to do.Here in blockchain in general and to me.Using a backend and having something.Hosted on GCP or AWS would sort of.Defeat a bit the purpose of everything.We're trying to do.So I'm trying to.Have everything running locally on the.On the client side and if not then.It's running on the on the contract.There's no database or anything like.And I'm really trying everything I.Can to to avoid all of that.I mean even.Think about using distributed database.Using IPFS and things like that if ever.I I have the needs to use a database.There's also developer sections to.Discuss a bit about the architecture.So things which are also in the in.The SCF proposal that you you can you.Can have a look at then the contract.Address and and some links and the.The app itself.So I can directly jump.Into the.H and so yeah that's the main app. so. if you ever went into the app you.Will notice that it's really different.Now because I just merged like two days.Ago this revamp of the UI.So I'm I'm.Really happy with the with the result. I had the design designer team.Working for two months on it. so.Thanks to the SEAF funding that I was.Able to do that.That's pretty amazing.So the logo and everything and all the.Look and feel u it's really really.Helped me a lot made it possible.How is the app is working is that.Basically you you have your project so.Yeah you can search for a project it's a.Normal search so tansu I have tonsu if I.Don't find anything it's going to tell.Me oh there is nothing on chain and.Then I can create a new project so.I'm not going to do that here just going.To an existing project so tansu so.Here you have a bit of details and then.You look at your project itself so I.Register tonsu and tonsu it can be a bit.Confusing Sorry. because yeah, I.Wanted to to manage my own project with.My own tool basically. so what is the.Project page?
So the project page I.Can I can quickly go over it.So you.Have some some quick information here. you have this famous support button.Which allows you to to give some tips to.The the tools that you use if you like.What they're doing. so here as I said.That's the only way that right now tons.Protocol will be receiving any any.Funding.So by entering here an amount.So here you can you can do that. quickly on the wallet side because.Here there was a there was something to.Sign I'm using the Stellar wallet kit. this is.On but you may want to look into.Protocol.That's running aware but.Interesting.Okay thank you.I will have.A look.Let me copy.All right, copy that.Thanks.Thanks, Matias., yeah.And so here the the main.Information that you have and the.Information which is actually stored on.Chain is this thing the the last.Hash. so yeah here you see I have a.Bug apparently because you don't see the.Hash but you you see it you see it.Here being being represented.Have all the hashes here and you can.Actually go onchain and see the the.Project itself.So let me just quickly.Go there.So here's the contract itself and every.Time you do something yeah you would see.It see it here and here are all the.Entries and so how is the project.Defined let me try to find it so yeah.Here here's the the project defined so.Here is saliv but had tonsu yeah here's.The project how it's defined so that's.That's basically the information store.On chain I saw the project name some.Config itself so who are the.Maintainer of the project so who has.Really access on. and and after that I have some.Some other metadata associated to that.And the the main metadata right now is.The the last state of the project on.GitHub which is a commit hash.So this.Is this store in in another entry. yeah this seems yeah exactly this.That key for tensu here is the same.As here last hash and that's the last.Hash which is register right now which.Correspond to a commit which exist and. so if I go back when there is.Actually a match with unshaded data.And the data that you find on GitHub.It's indicating you that everything is.Fine here you have a green tick and.So if somebody would compromise GitHub.Basically and overwrite the commits on.GitHub.This will get read and I in the.Future I will add some triggers which.Will send some notification to people to.Say that hey something happened on.GitHub versus what's on chain.So that's.One of the main security feature that I.Have right now and the same goes with.The configuration to say who's.Maintainer who's not maintainer.Is check against the this tomal this.This tensu tomal file that is I'm.Comparing the data which is in this file.With the data that have function to to.To have this this sort of check.Yeah here you have the the commit.History here you have this commit that.We just saw this F72 which was on which.Is verified and because I defined some.Maintainer this is the last one that.I've done to and here I'm a verified.Maintainer in this list.So you have.Some indication here of what's on chain.And and to be able to verify that.That's the first part, the security part.And the most important part for me is.Really this governance part.If I go on the governance, that's really.Your your DAO.You have not the Dow for.The complete. for for Tanu, but for every single.Project you you get a Dow, your own D.So this page will look different for for.Everybody.And maybe if I go back to.The to the explorer.Itself, I can quickly show it.Here you.Have the DA of Tensu basically here and.Here you have all the list of proposal.And so on you can directly see who voted.Who approved or abstain and what's.The status of the vault the title and.Here you have something you have IPFS.Because I don't store the proposal.Themselves on chain but I use I use.IPFS so once again I see some.Questions detail from the Gitcoin. yeah I look into Gitcon.Actually,.If you look if you go to see my.Proposals for SCF, you will find the.Technical documentation and at the end.Of the technical documentation, I made a. I had a look at everything which.Was out there around G around.Decentralization and all of this concept.And I made a comparative analysis of.What I think of missing or or was.Good and I'm trying to combine all of.The the nice concept and have it there.Basically what is the actual data that.Is being stored on chain for the project.I worried about state expiration so.Yeah the data on chain I hope I'm.Answering right now the questions and.Otherwise for the state expiration .Yeah that's something actually I'm still.Thinking about it exactly how it should.Work and how I should extend all the.TTLS and things because I'm I'm not sure.Actually right now so so for now I'm.Not really dealing with it because I'm.I'm still on test so I still have the.Freedom to do that.But that's.Definitely something I'm looking into.Have an openish on that to but I I.Still need to to take more time to just.Think about how the the workflow is.Going to to work this how should I.Pronounce your discord name.Tupi it's.My it's my second name actually.I asked.The same question before we joined.Yeah, it's a classical.Question.All right.So going back on.The on the on the proposals.Themselves.So let me just open a.Proposal to see how it looks like.This data as I just shown before is.Stored on IPFS.So what you just saw.Right now is loading the data from IPFS.As I said there's no back end or.Anything and everything's running client.Side.So this was loaded from IPFS.That's the proposal itself.When you.Create a proposal you can put an image,.You can put whatever you want.I have.Like a markdown editor.You can put.Tables and all of that. and then all.Goes to IPFS.So I can actually open the.The link and you will show how it.Is.Yeah, it's..Loading.It's funny.It's loading faster.On my thing than the IPFS itself.Wasn't.He in Austria?
Yeah, I'm living in Austria in Jenna,.Yeah, I'm living in Austria in Jenna,.But I'm French coming from Tahiti if you.Want this to be even more.Confusing.Okay, I the IPFX Explorer.Don't know what is happening, but yeah,.You see the link here.It's a IPFS link., yeah, it's not loading for some.Reason.And I mean, this is not.My my internet.Starting again.No, I mean the link is.IPFS, but it's.Loading here.So, you have it here.,.One concept I have on the on the D.Itself, it's pretty surprised.One.Concept I have with the the DA proposal.Is that I have the concept of outcome.And so when a proposal is accepted it.Can execute when when you're going to.Execute the proposal itself and to to.Have the the tally being calculated.You're actually going to be able to say.Okay if it's approved please execute.That transaction and so here you have.An example of of ex that I put so here.In this it's a trivial example that I.Put here but you can put any any when.You create a proposal and so if the when.You execute a proposal You're going to.Have like a screen telling you this is.Going to be executed when you actually.Execute the proposal.And so the the.Ting is going to be made and this is.Going to be also also sent.So what what.Can you use that for?
You can use this.For instance to add a m not just to pay.People but to me it was to do some.Special action for maintainers.For.Instance, if you wanted to change the.Structure of your governance, you can.Say you can have a proposal saying, "Oh,.Yeah, what about we add I don't know.Pumpfield to to this other community.".And so you will make a proposal and the. the XDR itself would just be to call.The tanu contract itself and to add.Myself to another project and people.When they vote and when you execute that.Then I would be able to be added.Automatically into the into that new.Organization.So this way you can really.Manage your the the whole governance.Of your project on chain as well or the.Aspect that you have on chain.Also you can yeah have font.Distributions and all of that.And what.I want to to do afterwards is so right.Now it's very manual.You have to .Create your own XDR and paste it there.But what I want to have is templates.That people can use and they will be.Able to to have like I don't know a drop.Down and then select yeah I want to add.A maintainer.Boom.And then you will.Have a few fields to fill and boom it.Will just pre build the easier for you. and I also want to be able to have.Some things that you preign and then .Everything is being able to to be.Executed automatically and things like.So this is coming but the the main.Feature right now is is there is you you.Have this ex that you can.Execute and yeah I think that's.Basically it., if you have any questions,.I don't know if there was any other.Questions.I think you got through all.Of them.Yeah, super exciting.To see to see it.I I've been poking.Around a little bit just to play with.It and I think it looks it looks great.I think it's it's a Thank you.it's a.Great great great project and .Yeah, I love to see how much you you.Decentralize the the DAB as well.So, so.Yeah, really really interesting.Projects., do did do you have.Anything else in the presentation, the.Other presentation?
, no, that that.Was it.I mean, my next big.Thing is really to to bring anonymous.Voting there., this I'm really.Excited about., I've been working.Like a lot on that and learning as well.I I knew nothing about zero knowledge.And homorphic encryption and all of that.And I just got the idea when I saw the.Protocol 22 update that it was bringing.That and then I started to look into it.And I really like the concept and and I.Think that's bring quite some value to.To the project if I if I had that.Feature and so yeah the I have an.Open source an open pull request.Everybody can check out the code and and.Yeah please feel free to to also use .What I've discovered.And when what about to for your own.Project?
Okay. yes.So Matias is asking yeah. using NQG for for the voting. yes.Sort of like with this badges that I.Want to use.So the trustful the the.Project that I want to use.They they.Have this concept of badge and I want to.Sort of have some neurons which are how.Many badges do you have and what kind of.Badges do you have?
and this maybe.With on top things like okay how many.Times you we can actually in the history. of GitHub we can find your name and.This will maybe give you like a a power.On the on the the actions that you.Have on chain to say oh you're an active.Maintainer and you can also have like.Some crown job running in the background.To say oh if you've not been active for.That that long code wise then maybe.We remove your code access and things.Like that.So you can I'm really.Thinking about all these kind of.Things on pola dot.No, I did not know.About.It's great.That's why I like.Stellar so much. have so many people.Giving you ideas like that and and.Sharing interesting things.Just now I feel compelled.To please do have a look.Everything is.Open. right now it's very easy.Have a monor repo because yeah I'm.Just working myself basically on it and.Yeah it's it's on my GitHub profile.So GitHub.Tonsu and then SOROBAN versioning is.Called the the repo.Yeah it's great.I love you you bring a lot of new ideas.To the table here.I think there's some.Of the solutions you're working on is.Something we probably haven't seen or.Haven't seen a lot of in the community.So I hope this is a an inspiration for.Everyone else to go and take a look.At at at your project, take a look at.The code, see some how how you're.Solving some of these these these.Challenges or creating some of these.Creative solutions to.To sometimes well-known problems or.Some new.Problems, new ways of doing things.So,.It was it was really great to get to get. to get the opportunity to chat with.You and to see the project you're.Working on and yeah, thank you so.Much for joining.Thank you very much for the invite and.Yeah, thanks for the audience for all.The nice questions.Okay, great.I think we'll wrap it up.Here then. we will be back next.Thursday and if anyone out there has.A cool project that they would like to.Talk about here on the still a.Developer meeting please reach out to.Me.I think I think it's very.Interesting to see some of these.Projects and and and talk to to the the.Developers behind it and hear some of.Some of their their thinkings about how.How they they solve these problems.Thank you everyone for joining.I see.You next week.Thank you.Thanks everybody.Bye.
