Hi everybody .Actually can you allow me to present my.Or to to .Share my screen here.Or the host.I can help you share from my end if.That's okay.I think I can okay I can share as well. great welcome everybody as as gift.Said.We're going to introduce you. to dfs lab but more importantly the.Boot camp and what to expect from the.Event coming up.And .Inca from Stellar is also going to say a.Few things about how bootcamp fits into.Their.The community fund and.Also you know a little bit about what to.Expect from their side so here's our.Agenda we'll give you kind of a quick.Overview of SDF and it's something fun.Little bianca and then i'll give you a.Bit more about the boot camp.So just to just to kind of quickly give.You an introduction to who we are at dfs.Lab we we're an early stage investor.In the african tech scene we invest very.Early often at precede in startups.That are digitizing the african economy.So.We invest in a lot of marketplaces.E-commerce b2b e-commerce social.Commerce. and everything along kind of the the. the value chain of commerce in in.Africa and we.We have kind of a we're a very.Research driven thesis based investor.And our belief is that.You know while a lot of attention is.Being paid to fintech and some of the.Other.Areas that investors are excited about.We think the real prize is actually.Using some of those tools to digitize.The economy root and branch.And go from kind of cache based.And offline to digital based and online.So you can you can tell because of that.Belief you can probably understand why.You know we're very aligned with Stellar.Because I think they have kind of a.Similar. belief around you know digitizing the.Economy and making finance. seamless.And online and all that so. and we're as an investor we're very..Hands-on we don't call ourselves an.Accelerator program because we don't do.Batches with kind of a fixed curriculum.We actually focus on the individual.Needs of each company but we're very.Very hands-on we spend we have you.Know a few folks dedicated full-time.Basically to supporting our portfolio.Companies and.We're basically there to help them.Usually go from the early precede phase.To .To their first seed round that's where.We generally tend to intervene..We .Can't say too much about it yet but.There's more coming in the partnership.Area between us and Stellar .Around you know how we can help support.More companies with more funding and.Things like that so I can't say too.Much about it yet but should be some.Exciting stuff coming up in the future. that's us we have we have team in.In nairobi that's that's gift and.Also joseph who who's there as well.But we also have people in kenya and.South africa.I'm in paris steven other partners in.San francisco and we bring a whole host.Of different skills. I won't go into everything but i.Think that gives you a little bit of a.An intro to who we are as an.Organization.I could do you want to take over for a.Sec and give us a little bit more.Background on Stellar and the community.Fund.Sure thing yeah that makes a lot of.Sense yeah so for everyone who.Doesn't know me and it's neon desk my.Name is ankur and I'm a program manager.At the steli development foundation.Or SDF or short bar we're going to say a.Lot of abbreviations today SDF scf so.Just.Preparing you for that and so SDF is a.Non-profit organization with a.Mission to create equitable access to.The global financial system and as a.Non-profit we shepherd the development.And growth of Stellar which is a.Decentralized open source layer one.Blockchain network that connects the.World's financial infrastructure so.Stellar is really a.Back end so to speak to power apps and.Services where anyone can issue store.Transfer and trade all sorts of assets.Seller also has built-in like account.Logic for creating accounts and assets.Signing transactions and tracking.Balances overall .Like Stellar is really purposely.Designed to streamline.Financial services and really unlock the.World's economic potential by making.Money more fluid markets more open and.People more empowered. so there is like an exterior is an.Open source which means that anyone can.Build whatever they desire on the.Network with no application or.Permission needed.And speaking of building on Stellar.I lead a program called the Stellar.Community fund or scf for short the.Second abbreviation.Which is an open application a grant.Program hosted by us that serves us.The springboard for many businesses and.Developers building on Stellar to turn.Their concepts into tangible products.And services based on input from the.Stellar community we've actually it's.Quite an old fund like we're together.With our predecessor it's been around.Since about like 2016 and has.Distributed almost 200 million xlm which.Is Stellar's native currency to.Hundreds of seller-based projects based.On community input so that's pretty.Exciting you know what's different i.Know that there are many grants out.There for for blockchain so what makes.Us different.Three reasons so on at scf all kinds.Of use cases and project scope sizes are.Welcome and where other grants may.Primarily focus on innovation on.Traditional like services scf also funds.Like d5 nfts community education.And developer tool projects also the.Community is actively involved in.Guiding and supporting the projects as.Well as voting for the projects they.Want to see earn a grant. also.Fun fact scf grants have no strings.Attached so this means that grant.Recipients decide how to spend their.Grant and don't need to pay anything.Back so pretty pretty sweet I would say.So saf really operates biannually in.Form of rounds and right now the scf is.Welcoming submissions for its 11th.Iteration it's been 11 rounds already.With a total excellent pool of 8 million.Any developer team or company building.On seller can submit to the scf and.Request funding up to about like 200 a.Thousand dollars worth of xlm which.Depends on their project's code.Aside from funding participating in scf.Allows you to gather useful feedback.From the community gain traction in the.Ecosystem and also.Opens up unique opportunities for growth.So yeah and for the first time ever.Let's let's skip let's go to the next.Slide.Jake.Yeah for the first time ever .Submissions that get selected to.Participate in the scf.And.Are eligible to participate in boot camp.Can announce now participating sorry.Can now participate in a virtual startup.Bootcamp from november 1 to four.That will really like kick start their.Journey on Stellar.Or even if you're already in Stellar.Ecosystem like help with a particular.Problem that you haven't been able to.Solve before with the help of experts.And facilitators from both SDF dfs lab.And the community so yeah.Over the course of a few days.Participants will work with these.Facilitators to.Find a problem storyboard a solution and.Develop a rapid prototype before getting.Feedback from the Stellar community.Fund .From the Stellar community. but jake will tell you much much more.About that just so you know before.If you want to get considered for.Participation submit your style based.Project to the staff before september.25th and this is a little over a week.So it's really coming up so that is.The deadline before september september.25th also I saw some questions in the.In the .In the q and a.Section here on the zoom so definitely.Add your questions there and we'll have.A little a q a.Session like right after .Everything like at the end of the.Session right that's all from me and. yeah jake take it away.Thank you okay.Yeah that that was great so.So yeah I'm gonna give you kind of an.Overview of what to expect if you if you.Come to this event and .We're really excited about it we we.Always we've done a couple of these with.Stellar already in the past and they're.Super.Fun for us because we get to see.New companies who are you know often.New to Stellar they're trying to create.You know some kind of an innovation or.Crack some difficult challenge in the.Financial services space.And it's a very kind of a.Intense interaction where we really get.To go deep in what they're trying to.Build what their challenges are you know.Etc we get to meet their team and all.That kind of thing and so we really like.Them and I think I think the seller team.Does too for the same reasons you know.If you just really get to.Dive in and for us it's also great that.We get to be hands-on with each company.So we're not we're not just kind of like.Lecturing about you know.The future of fintech and all that kind.Of stuff when you go to a normal.Conference the the boot camp is really. you and your team coming and doing.Work in a really intensive but.Structured way with help from a whole.Bunch of different people us experts.Stellar etc so.It's not it's definitely not something.You want to think about like a typical.Conference or something like that it's.Really you working on your product which.Is you know which is what you should.Be doing if you're running a. so I'm going to start with kind of.Just high level you know almost like the.Philosophy of a design sprint right so.Some of you probably done design.Sprints you know we didn't we didn't.Invent them and. we won't be the last to use them.But we have kind of our own version of.The design sprint that we do.And the real idea is that you test.And prototype a solution in just five.Days.And you start with .You know a problem you you you define.You know the challenge that you're.Trying to overcome.And then we have kind of a step-by-step.Process once you've. defined that problem.To go from there to a realistic.Prototype that you can put in front of.Users and get their reaction and that's.The critical thing about a sprint the.Design sprints is you're trying to avoid.Building an actual product which sounds.Weird right like why why are we teaching.You or why are we encouraging you to.Avoid building product everyone else is.Telling you yeah build product that's.The most important thing.But. what's important is actually to build.Product that people want and this.Approach of a design sprint is a way to.Fast forward into the future and say.Okay.How are people reacting to this product.Before we've actually built it so we.Don't have to waste the time building it.If they don't react in the way we hope.It's a it's a great methodology.There's a few links here you can read.More about it I encourage you to do that.But that's the fundamental philosophy of.What we're trying to accomplish with.This and.And you'll be surprised how realistic a.Prototype you can build.So here's here's the process now some.Of you have done. you know sprints based on the sprint.Book which we had to link to on the last. or some of the other methodologies.This will look a little bit different.But it's okay you know a lot of the same.Steps are there.And the same fundamental outcome is is.There.Because because we kind of have limited.Time and we're planning to we're.Assuming that there's going to be a.Large number.Of participants we're going to try and.Have each participant team.Define the problem they're trying to.Solve before you show up so that'll be.Important to know is that you know spend.A little bit of time.Before we start on day one.Actually figuring out and defining a.Problem we're going to send you some.Exercises to do to make sure.That you've actually done that because.It's actually.Kind of a common problem we see with.Product designers and founders where.They'll say oh I know what the problem.Is but they actually haven't thought it.Through in enough detail to to really.Have a high resolution version of the.Problem so that's what we're going to.Ask you to do before before the event.Starts.Day one.Will then be to say okay.Let's take the problem that we have.Map out what the sort of you know.Original customer journey is.And think through where in that customer.Journey we might want what do you sort.Of current or or standard you know.Industry standard customer journey and.Then where in that customer journey or.That that sort of.Experience do we want to intervene with.The prototype that we're creating today.Right. so that's day one it's really mapping.Out the problem in high level detail and.And figuring out where we want to.Intervene. day two and I'm going to show you.Some examples of each of these in in.In the next few slides so basically.You'll come up with a map and i'll show.You the map in a second right. day two you're gonna focus on which.Solutions. you you you know you wanna use in.Your intervention.And you're gonna generate actually a.Whole bunch of solution ideas. you know so you kind of widen the.Funnel of ideas before you then narrow.Down on which which which particular one.You think is the best and that process.Of widening and creating new ideas we.Have a whole bunch of .Well not a whole bunch but we have a few.Steps. and exercises to do to make sure that.You really stimulate your creativity.And bring in you know the best ideas.From the team and make sure that you.Don't jump on the first idea that comes.You know comes to mind but you actually.Explore really deeply this set of ideas.Space in your head that you know sort of.The set of the possible if you will.And then we have a similar set of.Exercises where okay now all the team.Has kind of put all the ideas out there.Now we're going to narrow down.Using some anonymous voting and some.Ways of giving feedback that try to.Avoid biasing the solution based on.Who's the most convincing or who the.Feedback comes from often you know.People. think that you know because the ceo. said oh I like this one then that's.What we should do and at the end of the.Day the ceo probably has to make the.Decision but.We do think that it's better to.Make sure that that everyone's kind of.Perspective and thought process is kind.Of treated equally in the initial part.So that you you know you kind of narrow.Down the designs based on best thinking.And not on who's you know the most.Senior or the most convincing you know.Some people just have a great way of.Putting it.But that may not be the best idea so .So so day two.Is really going to be about .Focusing down on okay what's what's the. sort of product approach and solution.That we want to create. the next step after that and that's.Kind of end of day two going into day.Three.Is. first you're gonna storyboard your.Your.Prototype they're pretty high level of.Detail.Now.People always want to resist this they.You know they found their idea on day.Two.They want to jump right in and build it.But we really really push back on.That it's not a good idea and .The reason it's not is because.Basically.When you jump in and try to build.Something you think you know what you're.Building because you've got this idea in.Your head but that idea doesn't have.Enough detail. to actually be a coherent. feature on your product.And so what happens is you start.Building you build you know part a and.Part c and part f.And then you realize you gotta fill in.The other stuff and as you start to fill.In the other stuff that you weren't.Thinking about you know when you just.Kick the thing off.You realize that i've got to redo part a.Because it doesn't fit together better.You know it didn't fit together well or.Doesn't make sense now that i've thought.Through part b.And you start creating kind of a.Non-linear.Problem to solve where now everything is.Interrelated and you have to change this.When they have to change this and slows.You way down and you end up having to.Often sometimes just completely restart.And do the whole thing from the.Beginning right.Most of you probably experience that at.Some point when you're dealing with a.Complex system like a product right.So what we say what we say we encourage.People to do is spend the time it only.Takes a maybe two hours to really create.A detailed storyboard that says okay at.Each step here's what we're going to do.There's going to be a button that button.Is going to take you here you know it's.Going to you're going to do something.You're going to put in some data you're.Going to whatever you're going to do.All that stuff will be thought out.Including.Pretty high level detail on content if.There is any so if there's wording if.There's text if there's images.You can say okay we need an image here.We need to you know we need some wording.Here.Then you go into the then you go into.The prototyping phase you've got a.Really detailed map you know that says.Hey.You're going to do it's just like a.Recipe that you follow and you are going.To be so much faster in building your.Prototype if you've got that recipe.Laid out or that storyboard so.And then in the prototyping phase.That'll be day three and it'll actually.Kind of. you know go beyond day three a little.Bit you'll have a bit of extra time.On day four as well.Where you'll be prototyping.You will .Have support from us. but in particular you have support.From the Stellar team there'll be some. engineer folks who you know know the.Apis and and all the.All the ins and outs of the of all the.Different seller technology.So that you know you won't get hung up.Trying to read through documentation and.Things like that I mean their.Documentation is actually quite good of.Course but .But in any case they'll be folks who can.Help you you know live in person as well. and .There's gonna be the whole community and.I'm gonna get into that in a second.This is just kind of the sprint aspect.There's gonna be a kind of a whole extra.Layer around all this. which is the community part of it so.Once you're done with your prototype.You're gonna get in .You're gonna then test it with .With users and that's actually.Something new we're doing this time if.Any of you were at the previous boot.Camp we didn't do that.But it's it's supposed to be a integral.Part of the sprint it's very it's.Actually the most important part in fact.It's it's really why you do a sprint a.Design sprint in the first place.Which is to.You know find out what people think and. again we're gonna have to we're gonna.Have kind of an integrated.Integrated process.Where .People from the.Community can be your user and give.You feedback on how you know how the.Experience goes when they use your.Product or test the feature or what have.You.And so you're we're gonna do some.Workshops on how to how to do that.Testing in a way that doesn't bias your.User it's very easy to bias someone.Who's who's testing a.Product or a feature and they're kind of.Looking at you.See like.You know how do you feel when they do x.Or y they don't want to hurt your.Feelings if it's clear that you're the.One who built this thing you know they.Don't want to say it's terrible or that.They don't like it or they give you a.Bunch of really positive feedback but.It's not you know it's not real it's not.Their gut it's not their real gut.Reaction.So .And there's a lot of other ways you can.Buy us you know by the way you.Present it by the way you talk about it.By the way you know.The situation you put the person in so.We've got we're gonna we have a.Workshop plan where we're gonna give you.Some tools so that you know how to do.A user test session with a prototype.And how to collect the feedback and how.To organize that feedback into sort of a.Useful.Output so.So that's that's the basic sort of.Step-by-step process of the sprint.Itself.You know.It like I said it's it's it's a lot.Of fun it's very kind of both draining.And energizing because it's pretty.Intense.There's a lot of steps and and you you.Use in your brain a lot.And you kind of kind of dump out all.Your creativity and make decisions and.Then build stuff it's pretty cool. and what we see is that often.Within the within the within each.Company.Not only does it help.You know really rapidly go from. you know some particular problem.You're having with your user base or.Your you know user experience or.Whatever it is or you're trying to you.Know improve. or if you're or if you're.Fundamentally new maybe maybe you're.Just trying to build a very very very.Basic first version of the product if.You don't have one yet. it really you know it definitely.Helps do that really quickly and in a.Way that like I said is based on user.Feedback and so.Much more validated and much more likely.To result in the final product that you.Built you know being useful and liked by.Your users.But it's often also.A way because you spend because you're.So focused and intensively working on.Your product .And you're doing it in the context of.Seeing a lot of other teams do their.Products think through their challenges.And solutions etc you're interacting.With a lot of people who you don't.Interact with on a daily basis but who.Are you know experts in this area. you know our mentors and facilitators.Us the Stellar team the community.Members you're gonna have some really.I think most of the time we see teams.Having these really interesting kind of.Revelations about.Their strategy their product you know.Their pathway to market their.Distribution.All those other things that don't.Necessarily fit directly into the.Storyboard that you know or the product.That you're prototyping but that fit in.Around it so it's a it's a it's a really.Valuable process I think and.We see a lot of companies. getting a lot of value out of it i.Wanted to just kind of quickly give.Some .Some examples just to illustrate what i.Was talking about so remember I talked.About first day you draw out the pathway.The user pathway.And and then you figure you figure.Out where you want to. focus and intervene so this was a.This was one from a customer who was.Doing a cash in cash out.At a mobile money agent network in kenya.You can see kind of all the different.Process steps that are going on you know.They're entering their number they're.Talking to the agent and I won't go.Through everything.And then the team wanted to forward on. sorry wanted to focus on these two.Areas that are circled in green so that.Was sort of the end of their first day.Basically of sprint they came out you.Know this is this is what they come up.With there's there's other steps and.Other things they created. but you know this was kind of the.Main final output and it basically.Guides the creation of their solutions.The following days to say okay we know.We know the process that where we fit in.And we know what we want to change.That's essentially what you come out of.Day one with.And what we're going to do we're still.We're still kind of.Fine tuning how we're going to have the.Interactions with the community members.And things like that but we are going to.We are going to find a way that you can.Sort of present and show this to the.Community probably via discord.Either get feedback people may vote on.Which which kind of problem .You know you know problem diagram and.Problem choice that they like the best. et cetera et cetera so we're going to.Have some kind of like.Really cool ways where you can interact.With the Stellar community and really.Get.You know even more feedback and more.Ideas and more.More more sort of expert help with what.You're doing.So this is the output of day two or it's.One example anyway and what you can see.Here is we got this three three pages i.Think each one is supposed to be a. looks like an app screen on a phone.Maybe.You know you're you're you're just kind.Of going through a sign looks like a.Sign up process right there's a sign up.Button on the first page and then. there's a you know looks like there's.Some marketing lingo on the second page.So it's kind of an onboarding process. the next one is maybe a text message.Based interface so anyway you know i.I don't know exactly what this.Storyboard was supposed to be but it was.Supposed to be an onboarding process for.A savings app.You can also see how there's these blue.And pink dots you're probably like why.Why are those all over the place.So that's part of.One of the steps in the process is.People on the team and also other people.Outside of the team can.Vote.On which things they like best and which.Things they like.You know that they think should go into.The final version of the prototype.And that's non-bonding you know it's.Kind of like a.Thumbs up on facebook or claps on on.Medium you know it's just kind of like.People express their opinion and that.Gives you kind of this heat map of like.Oh boy there's a bunch of dots over here.On the you know in some part we should.Probably keep that and there's no dots.In this upright no people didn't seem to.Care about that part so maybe we can cut.It out or something like that. and eventually you'll have a couple.Of these because each you know there'll.Be more than one of these storyboards.Initially as remember I said we're going.To first start with a bunch of ideas and.Then narrow it down.Eventually the the decider on the team.Will .Will they make a choice and they may.Choose one storyboard or one sort of .Three three page you know.Thing or they might reconfigure and.Mix and match you can do whatever you.Want but the idea is to use this heat.Map and the feedback that you've got.From the team to kind of choose okay.We're going to do this particular.Idea for an onboarding or for a.Transaction process or whatever you're.Doing.Yeah so that's the first thing that.Again community is going to get involved.Here too same same as before we're still.Kind of fine-tuning how exactly that's.Going to work but they're you're going.To be able to kind of show and get.Feedback on some of this stuff and we're.Going to have I think some prizes and.Voting on like you know best best ideas.And things like that so.Day.Three I believe will produce this.Storyboard so this is an example of.Storyboard I was talking about.It's not super pretty. you can see.But it gets the job done so essentially.These are supposed to be a series of app.Screens you know you can see the.Wireframes.And in a few cases they. just photographed.Hand-drawn diagrams and put them.Straight in there that's totally.Acceptable and cool. then they also put you know you can.See kind of the step-by-step . with the yellow sticky notes where.Each one kind of says you know what's.Happening at each step and. you get a little bit of the kind of.The menu options and things like that.You know basically it's kind of like a.Transaction flow on some level.And so this is you know. doesn't have to be that you know that.You don't have tons and tons of detail.As long as you know what's happening on.Each page and all the pages that you.Have to build and how they kind of.Interconnect to each other you know.That's that's what you need to get done.And once you have that then it's really.Easy then you just.You know then you're just heads down.You're building. the other thing we usually do is .Wire diagram for the transaction process.That's happening on the back end and.That's you know where. you're gonna be interfacing with .The different parts of the Stellar.System.And you're in in your own you know your.Own system as well. if you have one.And so this usually helps kind of.Clarify.Both the information and money flow if.You know if it's a financial transaction.Of some kind that's happening on the.Back end not everyone needs to do one of.These but most people do it's usually a.Valuable exercise doesn't take very long.But again same idea it's basically.You're trying to just map everything out.So that you go to the building mode.You're not.Drawing the.You know the the.Blueprint diagram.As you build at the same time right you.Have the blueprint then you build.Now I mentioned and alluded to some of.This stuff earlier but one of the.Things that's really cool about this.Boot camp is and we're really excited.About anyway.Is we're introducing a bunch of new.Features and things we haven't done.Before. part of the idea was you know when.Stellar came to us and said hey you know.We've done smaller boot camps before we.Have a lot of one-on-one.Stuff.But we really want to make it so that.Each company has a chance so so that a.We can bring in a lot more companies and.Make it more available to the entire.Sort of community fund. participants. and folks who are applying.And we want to make it so that it.Interacts so that all of them get to.Interact and the process is interactive.With the entire community.Which is which is super cool it was a.Little bit daunting I have to say i.Think it was like hey guys you know go.Do go do that and you're like yeah.That's gonna be complicated but actually.It turned out it was a great idea and .We're really excited that we that we did.It because now we come up with a whole.Kind of a new system that we think will.Do those two things a lot better and.It's gonna be a lot of fun so a few.Things to expect from this new approach.One is as i've mentioned a couple times.There's gonna be help from community.Members to test ideas get feedback get.Advice etc and the community members are.Gonna be kind of like activated and.Online and available and and kind of.Looking in you know on what's happening.We're like I said we're still exact.Mechanisms for that are still being.Developed but one one thing we're trying.To do is pair.Each team.With a community member that has.Relevant expertise and a desire to kind.Of maybe some you know passion for the.Area that they're building on.And sort of pair you so you get you.Get an extra person on your team to kind.Of give new ideas and help move the.Process along and and be just like on a.Sounding board and things like that so.That should be pretty cool you get to.Meet someone new from the community. another goal of this and like I said.You'll be showing the outputs of your.Process as we go along to the community.And getting feedback.But but you also of course being at the.End kind of showing your final product.Is a great way to expose what you're.Doing to the broader community remember.The the scf awards. are are a choice by the community.Itself not not just the the Stellar team.And so you really you know you want to.Expose people to it make sure they know.What you're doing and that'll help a lot.When it comes time for the for the.Voting on you know potentially on your.Project.We've created a bunch of self-directed.Modules and videos for each step of the.Sprint process so normally in the past.Basically I would go up and explain.Everything. and then you you know you the sprint.Participants would do it.And with a facilitator now we're trying.To make it so you don't need to have a.Facilitator and you don't need to have.Me talking to you. although we will have some points.Where you know myself or somebody from.Stellar we'll we'll jump in and just.Kind of talk to the whole group. but we're trying to make it a lot.More self-directed so some teams will.Probably be able to go a little bit.Faster some may.You know want to take more time in a.Particular area and so make it a lot.Better for everything for the.Suspense you won't be forced to move.Along at the same speed as everybody.Else.We're also going to have kind of some.Fun gamification quote unquote where.You know as the community sees what.People are doing. we're going to kind of create some.Ways for them to react and and you know.Promote certain ideas or teams id you.Know products. we want it to be positive and.Inclusive not you know like there's no.Down voting there's only uploading.But you know and there'll be a lot of.Ways in which to get recognized not not.Just like you know does everyone like.This or not but like you know the most.Improved or the kind of the coolest.Ideas in different different kind of.Categories and all that kind of stuff.And Stellar has been generous enough.To give small amount of money for cash.Prizes so.Some of the winners in different.Categories are going to take a little.Bit of cash home in your pocket it's not.Not you know not tons not.It's not retirement money but you.Know just a small amount to kind of like. get people's blood going a little bit.Make sure everyone's engaged and .Trying to put your best foot forward.We're also gonna have global time zone.Coverage so basically you can do.This sprint from anywhere in the world.And we will have.Facilitators available at least one .Facilitator and hopefully one. technical person available at all.Times basically.Which should be exciting.And a lot again it'll allow us to have.Companies from all over you know.Entrants from all over the world who.Participate. and to be a lot more participants.Last time I think we had nine and.This time I don't know how many we're.Gonna have but it's looking like you.Know 30 40 1950 so. so yeah it's gonna be exciting it's.Gonna be it's gonna be cool there's.Gonna be a lot of different ideas and.Products and.Cool new technologies so we're.Definitely looking forward to it.So after all that .This slide just kind of gives you the.Very basic boil down boiled down version.Of what to expect you come in with an.Idea and a problem you want to solve.And you leave with a validated prototype.Product and maybe some cash.So it's a really valuable experience.And if you've ever done a sprint .You'll know what I mean because almost.Everybody who goes through them is like.Oh I'm gonna do another one right away. and if nothing else you'll learn the.Methodology and .And you'll take it home with you and you.Can you can do it again so .Gift I'm gonna hand it back to you.Thanks everybody I don't know do we.Shoot you guys want any questions or.Other questions maybe that I should.Answer.I haven't been .So yeah there are actually a bunch of.Questions on the q and a chats but .Let's give room for.Emmanuel.To share their experience as i.Mentioned earlier emmanuel .Was a past you know participant at.One of the bootcamps we had and you know.Also one of the winners same with the.Crop the cash team so they will pretty.Much be sharing what their what their.Experience was like.As well as maybe also give us a bit.Of you know what they've been up to.Since the boot camp. so yeah over to your manual.Should I should I stop sharing are.You guys gonna go on video so people can.See you live or.Sorry gif we lost you should I stop.Sharing.Yes you can stop sharing yeah.Where are you guys.Okay I can go now.Yes you can.All right awesome thank you so much.Gifts thanks so much I felt like what.Would coffee came while he was giving.The presentation a lot of . you know not started like just how.Many months by the way my name is.Aristic manuel I'm the ceo and the.Co-founder of link.We are building with three crossroads.Premise infrastructure for africa we.Are opportunity.To be part of the dfs lab and .Bootcamp.Probably at the beginning of the year.Around april.Really was really fun experience for us.I you know I told when I spoke to anchor.Last I was like that was the.Highlight of the year for us really got.The ball rolling borrowing towards us.Building products towards relieving us.Going going going to market. I think with my for my team I think.One of the things we would.Really always remember were really.Stepping back really taking a breath of.The whole experience right to really.Understand because when we came into the.Bootcamp we had.Built just a piece of stuff around on.The Stellar blockchain so we're quite.Confident we're like okay you know what.We can you know skip the chase and go.Straight to day three or you know the.Fourth day five to them would be but .You know we had an awesome facilitator i.Was really able to.Walk us through day by day from the.Springs we got to ask ourselves the.Toughest questions from the sprints to.The crazy eights I think crazy eights .Whenever we get crazy ate and it really.Made us understand what we are building.Who are building for so until today .One of the the things that we were able.To take out from the boots camp really.Informs our decision even around product.Deployments even around understanding ui.Ux and really trying to understand okay.Yeah if you have a button there .Would that be a ux problem or how long.Is your solution compared to maybe an.Existing solution so you're really.Thinking about things we went down to.Marketing so for us was a really fun.Experience a great one we got to learn a.Lot.Anything just I think it was a week yeah.Really week my team really you.Know said okay this week we're really.Going to put our minds in I think after.The first day and we really saw how it.Was but I think it lasted from 12 p.m.At 10 to 5 p.m so it can be a bit.Exhausting but trust me after after.After the full week we're able to.Absorb a lot out of it learn like.We felt like we even knew anything and.Then from there it really was a.Springboard through everything we're.Able to undo today in fact after me.After that I'm just probably or two.Months later who are part of the.Stellar community fund which is by the.Way like you know doing something.Together I would put some really awesome.Stuff and we're winners of that too as.Well so yeah so my experiences.Throughout the bootcamp I would say like.Like I said the bootcamp was a highlight.For us and really was that a major.Springboard to most of the things we're.Able to do today we've had awesome.Partnerships since after the boot camp.With.Companies in financial space and other.Financial spaces in crypto space in.And out of africa to really help us.Enrich our mission like Stellar was.Beautiful because weather payments still.Was built for payments and and when you.Have Stellar helping you really solve.Those difficult problems and payments in.Africa and then you have the boots can.Really shaken in that your idea to.Really make you understand the things.You should really do.You're in the right place so yeah thank.You very much.Thank you so much emmanuel that was.Really really you know great a great .Experience rundown. I'm sure a lot of you know other to.Be participants would get you know a.Really good insight on what to expect.Thank you so much for also taking the.Time to you know come share your.Experience. so yeah over to you marvellous. okay .Good day everybody.I'm marvelous aquinola a cropster crash.Member and a participant of the Stellar.Bootcamp around april.In crop to catch a season prospective.Opportunities at the early stage.And seeing through them is one important.Thing we do not joke with. the knowledge of having to integrate.Into our existing platform was.Mind-blowing a lot of deep thought.Needed to be put in place.I'm forced to see the opportunity that.Comes with it and.To see how we can mitigate the.Challenges.To recommit to get the challenges of.Integration into our existing platform.And also to use to use the use case.Challenges considering our major targets.Being mostly uneducated.The experience generally was intriguing.And challenging at the same time given.That there are a lot of there are a lot.To achieve and in a little period of.Time.But I would say every time spent was.Worth it.It was an exercise that fostered.Teamwork as it presented an avenue for.Us to learn and as well as to network.With other people.And one thing I admit about the old boat.Campaign is the watchword that says .Get started not perfect.And trust me during the process starting.This 20 process of starting your.Imperfections with made perfect and.Nothing I particularly enjoyed was the.Structure of the bootcamp especially.When with the way we had to go from.Conceptualization of a solution to the.Implement implementation of what is said.Of the cell solution.And it should be alive by saying we were.Not faced with a bit of challenges at.The very inception of the old project.But with the help of our personal.Structure.Gifts and the moderator of the program.Rk we were able to get answers to every.Of our questions.Although it is expected that every.Participating member of the team.Should be in a common room so as to.Share ideas and be readily available for.Discussion.It is also noteworthy to mention.That.There was convenience the exp.Convenience experience weapon space in a.Boat camp was.Very great and my take on with after the.Whole boots camp is that everybody's.Idea is very significant.It doesn't matter how important you may.Feel our ideas are it will cost us.Nothing to actually share it with others.Who knows it might be the spark that is.Needed to light up.Other people's idea.And I cannot mention how lenient.And patient and also optimistic.The project anchors.At dls.Towards every individual team.So i'd like to say thank you for the.Opportunity and I wish everyone aspired.The very best.Thank you very much.Thank you so much marvelous thank you.So much for sharing your.Experiences with us I see that .Some questions have already been.Answered on the q a.Already so if you perhaps might have.Dropped your question. you can go back to the q and a.Section and just read the answers I see.Anchor went off like she went off you.Know to.[Laughter].To keep the keyboard running by.Answering your questions so yeah just.Feel free to go back there to check i.Think we're at this stage where we.Pretty much just have the floor open. for closing remarks and since you.Know.A bunch of the questions has already.Been answered on the q a chat so yeah.Over to you jake and anka.Yeah I actually .Thank you jake for answering I think.There is a comment as I was reading.Through everything yeah I think there's.A common thread it's like especially.Like for existing or like you know that.Because like scf right it's not only for.New projects that are completely new to.Stellar but it's also for those who.Are already a bit further ahead or even.A bit further and are like you know.Submitting a new product on Stellar for.Example that they're thinking about so.Jake like kind of like is like how.Would the approach be different for.These different types of .Can they also still like get value can.People that are existing also still get.Value out of the boot camp.Yeah totally and actually the boot camp.In the design square methodology works.Across any. level of organization we've .We've done with unicorns who have.Massive product suites that are already.You know processing billions of dollars.Per year.And they still you know they have.Product challenges as well they can.Define a problem that they want to solve.They have.You know somewhere in their product flow.Something's not working the way they.Want it to work they want to.You know ideate test some new things.Build a prototype of that new feature.The cool thing for companies that.Already have.Some version of a product built is often.You can use either screenshots or.If you've already done some prototyping.You can modify those prototypes so you.Get really realistic prototypes.Sometimes.Being embedded in stuff that already.Exists within your product and then just.Test something that's new relative to.What you've already built so yeah.Definitely doesn't matter what stage.You're at this is definitely useful.Still even if you're further on.Yeah yeah I would I would agree it's.Like it's just a methodology it's not.Just like oh it's not just kickstarting.Your product and stuff because.Obviously like you cannot just like.Build a whole product in a week but it's.Really like singling out this like most.Pressing problem that you choose to.Solve in those few weeks and then you.Get facilitators like that have.Experience you get community like.Ecosystem partners that might be able to.Help you and you can get like.Developers on Stellar helping helping.With answering any type of like.Challenges technically that you.Encounter so.Yeah like another like thing that i.Noticed here is that people are like oh.Are you like.Building a proof of concept or like an.Mvp after after the like bootcamp so.Jake like what do you what do you.Generally see bootcamp participants walk.Away with after participating in the.Well they're usually.Building a prototype and I and with the.With the proof of concept on the back.End so. it's like usually kind of a design.You know some sort of design front end.And that creates a user experience.And that can be done in all kinds of.Different medium you know figma power we.Use powerpoint. anything you know really just depends.What you're comfortable with.Or where you and and then usually.It's got a proof of concept sort of.Technical integration on the back end so.That you can actually make the.The machine and the machinery that needs.To work behind the scenes kind of just.At least do the basics right now it's.Not performance ready and.That kind of stuff but you're just yeah.Proof of concept on the back end side so.It's a combination of those two things.And the you know the idea is that.That really helps you move you know in.Only three days you've been able to test.Both the validity with the customer.Facing you know sort of prototype .Design experience prototype and then.Also test the technical validity so it's.Really that's the idea is that it's very.Accelerated way to be able to make a.Decision as to whether that's the way.You want to go or maybe.Didn't work out how you thought and you.Avoid having to build a whole.You know minimum bible product before.Before knowing that it's not going to.Work.Yeah that makes a lot of sense. I'm.I'm trying to let's see answer.Everything I think we we answered most.Of those things.Let's see how many oh yeah so for the.Amount of projects we are aiming about. like to see if we can get about 30 to.40 for the boot camp depending on how.Many submissions we get we just have to.See usually like for an entire like.Scf round we're trying to get around 50.Because that's usually the maximum.Amount someone can review like at all.It's already a lot trust me but for.Like and that will be like you know.Until the final october that 30.Deadline but we're expecting to.Have most of our submissions before the.Boot camp because the bootcamp can.Really elevate your presence in the.Stellar community fund round.Yeah I mean.I think I think I think that makes.Sense is anyone if anyone has any.Last-minute questions put them into the.Q a now maybe we'll be able to answer.Them but jake I'm gonna give the.Floor to you.Well .We don't not much else to cover.There's a few things here on the screen.You can see some next step stuff.There's some links and I think we're.Going to share this.Powerpoint if I'm not mistaken so but .You know definitely go read more about.The Stellar community fund.Obviously if you're applying you should.Read about it. but it's a really cool concept that.Stellar has come up with the whole.Community fund idea so. go take a look and learn more. complete your submission before.September 25th to be considered for the.Boot camp.Plan to come and give it all if you are.Participating if you're selected to.Participate so .Yeah that's.Hopefully giving you all good sense of.What to expect and and what are the.Motivations and why what you would get.Out of it and why to go and.Yeah I hope to see you all there.Awesome bye guys.Thank you emmanuel and marvelous too and.Thank you to your festlab team for.Participating.Thank you for bringing.Looking forward.Hi.Hi everybody.
