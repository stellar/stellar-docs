Now, yes ladies and gentlemen, good morning,.Good afternoon, we are alive, colors,.Yum, and YouTube, so just.A hello everyone, welcome.To our Imagine or.Finance panel with Botstein, supported by.Stellar Visa.I am Roberto Dulce and I will be.Moderating today's session.Sharing.The stage with me are some friends and.Experts from the world of INTEC and Botstein,.Who were going to introduce themselves a little bit in.The videos.My friends, please introduce yourselves.In order, your names, and your companies.That's how they will be in the presentation, and.When it's your slide, talk a little bit.About your role, your company, and above all,.How you ended up working with fintech and.Blogging to give a little.Context for our friends on the.Call.So, I'll start with.Myself to give an example.My name is.Roberto here in Canada, in the US they call me.Road, in Brazil they call me Vetó, but well, I.Think Roberto is fine for today.I am.The Director of Volume Business.At the Stellar Foundation, and very simply,.For those who are not.Familiar with this law, we.Are one of the first boxing networks.That was developed specifically.For For payments and international payments,.And the functionalities and operations.From the zone,.If you're the news, and with my way of.Hallucinating, and the one with the bag,.Well, we had a little more music.For us, always well, but.Return to the Stellar presentation.So, a brush for payments, our.Focus is on this volcano, it's the.Organization of financial assets and.International remittances, plus pending.Civil matters, and if.Digital currencies for central banks, and.Just an idea, we enable.International payments 24/7, the speed.Is about five seconds, never more than that,.And the cost is a fraction of a cent,.So a very, very efficient network.For payments.Regarding this, I.Started my professional career as.A programmer at Citibank in England, and.Today we have one of the.People here who started his professional life.With me, Marcelo, he's in the.Audience today, and after that, about.15 years ago, in multiple banks in the area.Of ​​digital product projects,.Silver, Rabobank, Bici, and fintech is something.More recent for the show, like 2017,.After where Blocks Game and it became my.Passion, and well, we're going to continue with everything, my.Friend, with you.Thank you very much, Roberto.It's a pleasure to be.With you.My name is Arnold Dos.Reyes, and I'm the Vice President of Digital Alliances at Visas.We are the world's largest.International electronic payments network,.And our.Mission is to connect.People, businesses, governments, and.Institutions to move value.Through our electronic network.I've been with.Visas for exactly four years.I came.To Visas through an entrepreneurial venture.And an investment I made in a.Company called Abra.Now,.In 2015-2016, we're creating a.Wallet specifically to focus on.Solving.Certain problems for.Consumers in emerging markets,.Primarily Latin America and Asia.Pacific.Before that, almost six years ago, I was at.PayPal in the.Emerging markets team, and then responsible.For expanding Visas to.Latin America in more than 20 markets, developing.Products, strategies, and alliances.My career has been primarily.In financial services, very focused.On emerging markets, mainly.Latin America.I've.Also worked in payment networks like.Mastercard,.And prior to that, I began my career...Investment brand, the team is taking time to.Lower criticism but is very focused.On Latin America and some markets in the.US and Europe, and it's a pleasure to be with.You today.I think what's.Happening in Latin America,.At least in.My professional career, I've never seen so much.Enthusiasm, so much investment, and so much.Talent, not to mention some.Truly incredible companies in our.Region.Thank you for inviting me.Gases del Toldo, and well, continuing, Jose,.Good.Morning, good afternoon, where are you?
Morning, good afternoon, where are you?
Thank you, and it's a pleasure to be here today.Thank you, and it's a pleasure to be here today.Jose Luis Nuñez, I've been in.The Pitt arena for 16 years, exporting for.International.E-commerce companies.Today I'm the Vice President of.Sales for Wire, and our company.Focuses on financial infrastructure and.AFIS, which means putting developers and.Entrepreneurs with block.Change projects, equipment purchases, payment methods, and.Value movements.Thank you very much, and it's.A pleasure to be here today.Wonderful, thank you.I mean, from Ruben with.You,.Hello everyone, how are you?
And thank you for.Having me here on this panel.I'm.Excited to be able to specify,.Jamie, how you can use this.Technology to solve.People's financial problems in the world.It's a The.Problem is that I've.Had the honor of actively.Trying to solve it.For six years now,.Working well with him, he kept.Starting from scratch, back when.The Cohen beat cost.$200.For me, it's.Been a.Gigantic personal and technical transformation, and not just inert,.But the industry is a super exciting time.Because. well,.Now those of us who.Provide services on top of the.Technology that exists right now are.Perhaps the first to.Bring access to it to the people who.Need it,.But the change is coming.En masse, and that's a giant network effect.That's pushing us, not pushing anyone, it's.Pushing everyone, so it's a.Great time to start.Taking the last minute to start.Doing something because later it'll.Be too late for the party, right?
But anyway, it's a.Pleasure to be here and to talk to you about.Someone who has a.Dollar account that people in Latin America.Can use to save, make.International payments and receive payments, buy.Things, invest, but well, it's practical,.Thank you, and if you still have the.$200 Obito Coin, I'll buy it for $250.So.We can Speaking after the.Presentation, but to do it, I generated.This summer, I was.Selling them, selling a thousand, because.You have to raise the price.A good day today, what a marvel, Cesar.Last but not least,.Please,.Hello everyone, good day, and.I appreciate the invitation to this panel.Speaking of.Health,.The reason for being is to signify.Business-to-.Business relationships, as I like to call them, and in.Recent years we have been focused.Through the corporate card product,.Making an impact on small and medium-sized.Businesses and startups,.To be able to facilitate the way and revolve, above.All, in which different types of payments are made.Part of what we seek is, through the.Technological power, to offer this.Platform in which we use several.Components that we will talk about throughout.This session: artificial intelligence,.Blogging, of course, and in the end, what.We bring is a value proposition that seeks to.Maximize time, especially in this era of.Hyper-connectivity in which we seek to.Do everything very quickly,.A matter of haste and constant.Evolution.Briefly speaking about myself, from the.Leap to the decent part, I have been.Working for the last 18 years in the.Area of ​​technology,.The Vittek space, and I see this Boom, what.Arnaldo described in the region, and.Especially how each.Country is absorbing a bit of the.Dye in the consumption and.Business sectors.It was, how.Would I say, a game changer for Pay,.Because I have to get on board with that,.Hugo, which is moving very, very fast, and in which a lot of.Change can be done through innovation, to the benefit of.Simplifying operations and, above all,.The lives of everyone here.Wonderful!
Well said,.Thank you very much.So now I'm going to.Close the screen here and let's go to.Our talk page.Of.Course, just one piece of information:.Sheryl is with us,.And closer to the end of the.Panel, we have a surprise, some very.Important information for.Everyone with us today.Regarding Startup Weekend, which takes.Place next week.So,.This will.Stay with us until the end.Because it's important information.Well, from my side, I have some.Questions here, but it's a very.Informal panel, and I'd like all the.Participants to join in to.Add comments and.Questions as well.So we can.Begin, I have six questions here that.Are grouped under the.Fintech landscape in Latin America, the click route, and.How we, each of you,.Brought yourselves here today, and for your.Companies, and finally, some advice and.Suggestions for those who.Are starting out in fintech and.To begin, I'd like.Rubén to ask you, perhaps the first question, about.Latin America as a.Whole, about your experience.Not only with your company but since the.Arrival of fintech, what do you.Think are the main.Financial technologies that are.Growing in Latin America?
Yes, and why?
Growing in Latin America?
Yes, and why?
Growing in Latin America?
Yes, and why?
Why do you think these technologies.Why do you think these technologies.Are growing in our region?
Well, you see, I.Think that in Latin America, as in the rest of.The world,.We have become accustomed.Over the last.20 years.To the fact that the products.We consume are increasingly.Focused on us as.Consumers, so much so that your experience.On your Instagram feed is very different.From mine.Yes, yes, friends, your Instagram feed.Wouldn't be relevant to me,.And I think that concept has permeated the.Whole world.In every.Industry that exists, we as.Consumers are currently expecting.Products that don't exactly suit.Us,.And that...well, it was.Born with the internet and the.Entrepreneurs who were born with the.Internet, given that it was very easy.To send a new,.More refined version of a product to their.Users.They are basically looking.To create the exact product for the.Exact person, and I think that has reached.Finance.I think there is.A lot of technology that allows.Many companies to.Offer financial products on the.Internet.Thanks to this.Entrepreneurial dynamic, where you are always.Looking to give the best.Exact product to the customer, there are.Now.Many alternatives.Of financial products that are hyper-.Targeted to specific consumers, and this will cause.An abandonment of.Financial institutions that for a.Very long time offered a very.Generic product.I'm not saying they are.Bad, but I am saying that.Thanks to this advent and this kind of.Convergence of....Premises, there will be.Financial products and services.Focused on niches that would otherwise.Be.Served by a provider that didn't.Speak exactly to you, millennial,.Impactful startup company that needs...A.Cooler card than the one the.SOFOM in Mexico gives you, or we have a.More suitable account for you,.Latin American freelancer, you like gaming, you get.Paid with PayPal,.And in Mexico, well, that's why there were so many.Applications.For the fintech law because there are.Many types of markets, in niche.Markets, to whom you can give a.Very suitable product and make a.Great business by achieving that.There isn't.A million clients in a bank,.Well, then lending to a million.People,.World Davis, you know, I'm sure we're going to.Continue expanding throughout.The region.There will be more John Bond Link,.More financial services with more.Options that are personalized locally,.Or rather, manage to create an offer that is.Much more suited to.Specific needs, and I think we're going to.See that not only throughout the.Region but across the entire range of.Financial services that exist for.Companies and people.Perfect.Well, I think this is a.Very important point for our talk.Today because Unbond Link is.Allowing new technologies to be.Used for specific cases and uses.In finance, and because before we had, like,.The solutions Grouped.By banks and the experience for.Remittances, that's what.The work is doing with.The cards for the 'semi'.It was something.That was very widespread, and so I think.That above the 'bund' link, it's.Also creating an opportunity for.Innovation in each of the.Verticals.And at this point, Arnold, you.Have a privileged vision because.You see the corporate side, but also.The side of Elvis Are Dangers, and I mean, in this.Emergence of new.Financial technologies with Conan Bund.Link and HyperFockers, as Rubén.Mentioned, I.'ve seen the investments in NATO funds.Following a specific area or.Trend.And if there's any projection of.Where these funds are going to.Migrate in the near future,.Where they will be in the world,.Undoubtedly I think there are certain.Macro factors in Latin America that.Are in our favor,.And there are regions like Southeast Asia.Pacific that also have certain.Similarities.We have a market with.More than 650 million people,.Most of whom are, in quotes,.Young people, being able to access.A smartphone that is.Becoming something every day.More accessible in.Terms of price and development programs, and at the same.Time we have.Financial services from.Traditional players,.Which is an extremely profitable business,.But at the same time it's a business where.Three, four, or five institutions in a.Country control 70 or 80 percent of the.Banking market.So I think that at a.Macro level, when you step back a bit and see.These dynamics, you say, well, there's an.Opportunity to offer.The most basic financial services.Simply in a much better way and with a.Much better experience than what we've been.Seeing.So, from the.Investors' perspective, both.Flequillo Ex and Vista, but also.Many of our investors.Are Valen, Cuide,.Etc.We invest with schools; there's.An immense appetite there because,.Despite what we read in the centers that they.Deny that Plaza So-and-so is raising more money,.All these investment rounds.Are excellent, but they still don't represent,.In my opinion, even 10% of the.Opportunity in Latin America.In my opinion, there is a market.That you could see in Newark, given its.Size.And what we've seen, and I would say.Mainly in the last 24 months, one thing is that there are.More crisis activities.They'll.Cut us off, Choca, but it's entering a.Bit more aggressively.Traditionally, it's the.Vista-type companies, but we're also seeing.Latin American companies that aren't in.Financial services.Some are.Not very large soda bottlers.That are making investments.In digital wallets,.And we saw this case with.Conecta in Mexico, where the first.Big investor was Oxxo, and.Through the Gente group.So we're.Seeing more activity from the.Difficult side and from traditional funds.What's.Interesting that we're seeing now.Is that there's.A group of funds that.Have traditionally been what they.Call "rose-colored" funds, which are funds that.Mainly enter.Growth rounds, series,.Etc.,.By Tim Cairo, etc.And these funds are.Now sometimes getting involved in.The rounds, if not.Today, the 'tie-break' and vice, to be.Able to have a position in these.Companies.So we're seeing, which.For me is excellent,.Liquidity.Because I've never seen, at least in.My career, I tell you, many friends have.N't.And the verticals that we're seeing of.Great interest,.One is infrastructure.Nowadays, it's not very easy to enable a.Program, say, for cards in Mexico.And verify it.A very easy way in.Brazil, and then launching.That infrastructure in Colombia, shouldn't be the case if there's.Demand.It increases, and there are companies that have already.Raised rounds, and.Others that are in the process.All the issues of Cristo, I think more.Recently with the benefits of the.Disc market in Del Viso, which melted.Two weeks ago, I.Think there's a.Very big opportunity there, particularly with.Stablecoins, all the.Solutions around USD/DC and.Other very attractive solutions.And then.In the area of.Basic financial services, I mean, being able to make.A payment online, not being able to buy.Or eat without a credit card,.And being able to get a.Consumer loan for basic services.That are currently offered by.Traditional players, but whose experiences are.Perhaps not the best.We are very active in the sector.Today.We have a portfolio of five companies.In the process of being established, with several more,.And we are investing in banking as a.Service,.Acquiring, or issues of how we grow.Merchant acceptance in the region,.Processors, issuers, many.Related infrastructures,.And so I think we are going to.See much more traction from.Large investors, funds, and the.Same You see,.A talent that we're seeing today,.Incredible talent emerging from companies.Like Braf and Uber Latin America, from.Strike,.And at a good time, The New Band, etc.So I think the dynamics are.There to start businesses, without a.Doubt.Well, wonderful also for me, who hasn't been.In Latin America for a.Few years, to hear this from someone.Who's closer because it makes me.Happy that we have.This liquidity, this opportunity.He.Spoke, and I think the categories he.Mentioned will be in.Our talk today as well.For example,.The infrastructure, the volume that.We're doing to scale.We're talking a.Lot about crypto infrastructure, going to.Companies that today provide.Custody or similar services.To see if.Making a deposit in the US.Or other countries is almost a million.Dollars in investment in.Latin America, also a considerable amount.So, it's very close to.Our perception.And that's it, Carlos.And.Continuing with this, a little.More on investments.Have you made any.Very.Recent contributions, and have you done so in an.Innovative way?
Yes, so can you.Talk a little bit about that?
From.Your company's experience as a startup.Fundraising in Latin America, and if this.Investment came from Latin America, the.Funds were given more from other.Regions,.Very gladly.At the end of the day, there's an.Interesting figure to consider: the population.Of Latin America is.650 million people, which.Translates into 650 million.Possibilities.So, Frayba has.Been investing in.Its own platform, and now, in.Our last.Investment round, we worked with various.Players.In the sector, a combination of.Players in North America and also in.The region, precisely because the.Possibilities seen here are quite.Extensive.We're talking about a.Place where there's a need to have.This mechanism to be able to launch.Businesses, especially at this.Point where we talk about—and I think it's been.Mentioned—the moment to be.A founder.So, it's about giving.These founders the possibilities, the.Tools to be able to have.Financial inclusion.And here the point is, okay, company after.Company sees that they are making.These connections, so what means do.We put at their disposal to be able to.Achieve this objective?
And through this, it's.Basically the The spirit I bring to the.Search, and we've been working hard.With these investors on this mission to.Empower companies and, more.Importantly, to facilitate—I'll tell you—their.Lifecycle, especially when we talk.About tasks that are sometimes part of.Everyday life, like simplifying the.Payroll cycle, being able to make.Transfers in a matter of minutes, or, well,.If we go to.Technological precision, seconds.Not having that.Competitive advantage that helps.Preserve this issue of.Speed—today we sometimes talk about how.Technology can cause disruption and.Change—and applied to.Findeter in particular, we see this new era.Of connecting services, not because we still.Have a legacy environment and a.New one, and now a.New way is emerging that will.Allow us to have a means to.Accelerate.And you mentioned that, well,.Part of the funding, while in.North America, part of the.Latin American region, and I think an.Interesting intersection on the topic.Of our panel, finance, and.Also the discussion of funding rounds.In Latin America, is that you also.Innovated in the way you do the round.New technologies will be used for.This.Can you talk about...A little bit of that.Too,.In the end there's an.Interesting component in the dye part, right?
And it's in.This era where everything is a service.Now we're playing hard with the.Banking-as-a-service aspect and.Enabling platforms that allow us to.Interconnect, especially to.Accelerate the last transaction.This greatly simplifies.Operations, and we're also introducing.How to accelerate.Payments.The famous PP professor has.Been a key issue for.Us, and all of this is empowered by.Allowing our clients to.Apply for a line of credit.In a matter of minutes.This is where we have a.Certain strong area of ​​the path because.We leverage.Artificial intelligence to have a model.That.Includes growth vectors.It's not a.Bit about renting the status quo and saying what.We can do to be a.Strong partner for these companies and, above.All, help them catalyze.Simplicity in their operations.In addition to this, there's the issue of.Expense management and also.Integrations with.Accounting platforms, which are again the area in the banking-as-a-.Service era, having this.Information close to real-time and the.New result in a matter of seconds.Being.Able to be aligned, okay, what is the.Intelligence on the money coming in,.But also the money going out, and.Ultimately being able to analyze what.These trends are, especially where I'm.Seeing more, where I'm.Spending more, what my.Needs are, and from there work.With other departments that contribute great.Value to the company, Edith, but above all, you.Can decide to donate less because of something.That is the data aspect, because here.In this new era it is a very.Strong lever for all of us where.Information helps us make better.Decisions.I asked that question.Because I know a little about the products you.Bring today.You started with products that,.Perhaps looking from the outside, seem like.Normal banking products, like a.Loan or a line of credit or a.Credit card, but you get.Closer to understanding how it works.You are using Block Cheyne and you.Are using this button.You are.Using this to enable, in exchange.For senders, the price, speed,.Better analytics.To improve it.So, do.You think it connects a little with what.Rubén and I were talking about, and to finish,.The super spotlights and how to improve the.Help experience, and using new.Technologies.Sometimes you use.Products that already exist, but they exist in.A different format.That it wasn't addressing some of the.Population's follow-ups, like.For example, fintechs and.Startups, and CCO believes that so here's.A message for those who.Are with us about the possibility.Of reinventing existing products.With other.Existing technologies, like blogs themselves.The last question for this section, I'm.Going to leave it open for.Anyone who wants to talk about it,.But I won't because it was very strong.For me that we have room for 45, 90, or.45 Mercado Pagos or similar platforms,.I wonder a bit why we aren't there yet.I mean, it's already being taken for granted that we're at.The forefront of the.Fintech revolution, a club that perhaps.Falls short or that we're lacking to reach its.Full potential.So, if anyone.Has an opinion, a point they'd.Like to bring up, well, I do.N't know what other evidence there could be that there is.Going to be, or is, a fintech revolution.It.'s imminent, you know.There's a.Beastly amount of money flowing into the space.There are.15 alternative financial products.That are competing for your attention all day.On Instagram.The "think it" means that you, and I.Think it's going to be.A somewhat painful change because.Right now the market is a bit closed.I do.N't think we can expect anything.Different.From a similar action or reaction.To what the taxi drivers had.When Uber came in.And I think.The taxis in this case are much more.Powerful than the taxis and the unions.They have, who nevertheless.Managed to make certain changes and have.Managed to slow things down in several.Cities.And I think that the banks, which.Have a lot of economic interests, are.Going to protect their motorcycles, just like I.Would, because I'm an executive who.Has a company, I have, well,.The game, because I'm not going to do anything but.Protect what's mine, you know?
And I say, I.'m very capitalist, for me anything goes.I mean, as long as it's.Ethical and moral, but.If it's a way, a license, you take advantage of it.That's how.I'm looking for the.License because it's going to be another way, and I know they're.Not going to let me do certain.Things because these Delmonte guys, the banks, we're.Also going to do things with the banks,.And if it becomes a case like.Venezuela, well, if there are cases like That.Person who also serves in those.Places,.Anything goes, and I think we have to.Work together and.Support our friends at Vista.Estelar because in a way you.Have.A key;.You can.Give a person in a country a.Card with which they can spend their.Money.It's a super powerful channel, and.Visa.Has to decide.If it wants to be on the team of.Innovation, inclusion, and progress,.Or if it wants to help the banks.Save their money.And I think it's.A question for more because.I think there's a lot of.Infrastructure that doesn't depend on.Banks; it's there for the banks, which.Can also be used by Intex.So that Intex can offer.And this.Is gay, and Pérez can either not conspire.Or they can join the fight for.Financial freedom,.And Biz is a very clear example.Because they're right there in the middle.But for.Example, Kaká or Page weren't allowed to.Operate in Mexico anymore, so.Now you're going to see everyone going.Directly with Visa to launch their programs.Or with a sponsoring bank.But.The question.Here for Visa is, what do you think?
Which.Side are you going to take?
And what I say is to be.Careful.I'm going to knock on your door.On Monday.Arnoldo, neutral, because under.Clause 27, article 2 of our.Rules, your company is mentioned in the.Panel and has priority of response.So no, there's no.Problem.Actually, Vista is.In a very interesting position.We're literally sitting in the middle.Of several ecosystems.Not.Traditionally, if you know our history, it.Started.With a consortium of banks in the US.But I would say that although today.Most of the payment network business,.Not just Vista but other.Payment networks, comes from a.Relatively simple business—not very.Complex technologies, but very simple.You have.Members who are licensed for these.Networks.They partner with the networks, and these.Members today.Are mostly banks, and they issue or distribute.Vista payment credentials with.Any other brand.And our role is basically to.Ensure that the flow of money between those parties—.The banks, the acquirers, the.Merchants, the consumers—.Occurs.And at the end of the day, that's.Visa's technology.And what we.'ve done in recent years.Is issue primary licenses.To FinText, like FinText.You paint.So that they are another member of.Vista, not at the same time.Today you have companies that are.Based in Latin America that are already.Major members, just like a.Bank, and they can transact, they can.Consume Vista products, etc.But historically, I would say that companies.And other payment methods have been.Grouped with banks because the.Business model comes from there.A regulatory issue.That we also have to deal with, just like.The dyes.Not going to get into specific cases,.But to say, issues with cacao,.It's a decision of the CNV or the other.Regulators, not Vista's decision.Rather, we have a strategic alliance with.Cacao and many others because they help us.Enable Exintex, and in many cases, they.Help these farms to issue, say,.A prepaid credit or debit card,.In a fairly agile way.So I believe that our position is.And will continue to be.How we contribute to the growth of the.Ecosystem,.And at the end of the day, our philosophy is that the.Consumer will choose the best product, whether it's.A card from a Mexican bank or.Any other country, and we...What we've been doing, let's.Call it through a program we.Call Central CAFTA, which involves thinking.With Axtel, Victor Red, and through.Angers' view, is to help.The ecosystem grow.When money moves through.Visa networks, this money may have been.Generated by payments made by.Card players or traditional banks.But I do think there's a lot of work.To be done in the region because some.Markets, some countries, say.They're driving innovation, but at the.Same time, you see and say, "Well, you say you're.Driving innovation, but the.Regulations don't allow for anything that.Can be done." And.Part of our role is precisely to.Educate regulators, from.What cryptocurrencies are and what.Browsing is, to how a VILLA ONION works,.Because they are relatively new models.Within the ecosystem.But today, it's.An effort that doesn't just exist; I think.The rest of the payment networks that.We're trying to streamline today are also involved.And the.Point is not whether we're on the.Side of the banks or on the side of the numbers;.I think it's that we're in the middle, and.The business model...Rather, it.Feeds and grows as.More companies go towards what it.Does,.Managing products seen from other.In general, the ecosystem grows,.Not necessarily by taking the side.Of a personality, and Arnoldo, you don't.Feel like I'm attacking, but you.Clearly see it.[Applause].Pushing the technology, and you're on this.Panel, talking with those on.This side, and those from Bring Dance, and those from.Wire or Serpents.Clearly, you.Are pushing for that, but.My question is, how, and no, I don't.Know much about the.Integration that Visa.Stellar is doing, but.Could it be that.A client can spend their money.In their World directly on Visa and Visa.Receives, for example, some in.Exchange for that money they are going to.Spend, or will there always have to be a.Bank in between Visa and people who don't look.At the more specific part.Of the written work,.We will see that we have enabled.Settlement, which is the status of the.Transaction.In your case, it's different, so we have.Added WebBike, we have integrated the age.Of the 150 coins within the.Visa ecosystem, and so it has accepted.They can settle.Directly on Vista Net with Diversity.We launched the Betia Club.Through an investment we made.With the registration in the US to.Offer any.Player in Latin America who wants to provide.Those services of buying, selling, and.Storing Christ's coins to 13 Vista.Delights.Some things we are developing.Around energy and how to help.People who are generating energy to.Market it.So I think at the.End of the day it's.Not necessarily about.Ensuring there's always an.Intermediary; it's about how we can.Move value.As long as it's safe and reliable.And all that because there's one thing we.Know: the most intimate thing for a.Person is their money, or for a.Company.So I think there's still a.Lot to be done.Right now, the.Philosophy was...what.We're doing now is to eliminate.Intermediaries, not person-to-person or whatever.And so I think.Eventually we're going to find.Use cases where there's no reason to.Have two or three intermediaries.That's.Not necessarily what it's about, but to be.Honest, it's great.Because many tasks are relatively.New for payment networks.Yes, I.Think this discussion connects very.Well to the question because...Maybe it's in.The middle, yes, I mean, I see how Rubén.Spoke about whether it's ethical or.Correct to use it in the.Capitalist game, and he believes that Visa has.Interests in maintaining the 'Big Ben'.XXXII and they continue to use Visas,.But they have the possibility of bringing.Startup technology to the.Levels and also bringing.Non-credit access cards for the 21st century.So what we were looking at.Is that the university competition is an.Initial opportunity for, and other estimated.Coins in other currencies like the yen,.Bridgetown euro, and things like that.If you.Want an option to delve.Deeper into other geographies where,.For the prescribers first, this is much.More natural than going through.A bank and having more costs.So I think there's, like, Roberto,.Excuse me, just one question, what you're.Saying, and given that the panel is.From Latin America, is there currently a.Product you're interested in creating,.Obviously over time, to give that.Same access to those.Visa accounts that are connected to.You, yes, to people throughout the.Latin American region?
Giving them plastic cards.Giving them plastic cards.With which they can spend their.Money, and in any country.Like this, I imagine the answer is yes, of course.We're even seeing a.Use case in Latin America today.With marketplaces, and so.Wallets in certain markets will be.Able to receive those payments directly.To the wallet.A user decides and will have a.Payment credential, whether the company wants it digital or.Physical, and this person automatically.Receives this payment in their wallet, it.Pushes it to a Vista credential,.Whether it's digital.Or physical.So there are.Use cases that we are already.Working on in this sense.The other opportunity is.International promises.When.You think of iurgi, you can think of iurgi.Payments, between the.International sales version, but also.Domestic goals within Latin America,.Where there are countless cases.I would rather.Talk about which use case.You would be interested in building because my.Team is leading these issues,.And the more abuse cases we.Raise, the better for us.We are Vista customers, and we are.Very happy because we have a.Prepaid card that we can use to spend our.Over time, but obviously there are.Many improvements that can be made to the.Product, and there's networking, Roberts, but.It's incredible that you're here.Representing.A company with so much power in this.Battle, and battle because I think we're.All doing something to help people.Have better financial prospects.I.Agree, and I have a somewhat.Interesting role, not because I.'m involved in and pushing all.These initiatives, but at the same time, I.Sit on the board of several.Syntex companies, and I come to this world,.So I also have this field of.Influence,.And it's interesting because the dynamics.Are...sometimes you can gain an.Advantage, but the point is to be able to open the.Ecosystem as much as possible.And gentlemen,.We're here, like, on the final time channel.We have a question that comes into the.Chat, and Roger Rengifo asks, "Could it be.Done so that through a.Visa card, a person can buy.A token on the bot network list?".Then Roger Olori says, "Yes, it's already.Possible today, some tokens that are.Connected to this, to the RACC set, on Visa and.Mastercard through third parties like.PaySimple, to withdraw and others." And so.Here it's believed that these are a wallet.Where they can buy the...'Stable'.Currency also uses them and tokens that have been.Using a.Credit card, but Carnoedo.Mentioned here to Rubén that one of the.Things they are working on with.Visa is the fast track to.Issue a Visa card for the cards,.Which also serves the interest,.Not only to allow.People to buy.And hold.Crypto assets using the card,.But also for the company that.Issues the card to settle the balance.Using another.Digital currency, yes, because there we have a.Described ecosystem; otherwise, there's no need to.Go through banks and.Fees, and it takes from one or two days.So the answer, what do you think, is that we.Have something like that.Well, before I go over.To him and talk a little bit about startups, I.Think I'm going to ask a.Final question here for the panel, and I'm left with.The truth that time goes by.Very quickly when we have such an.Interesting topic.We have, I think,.Entrepreneurs and people who are.Starting their projects.In the group.Do.You have any advice or.Final comments from your side for.Them who are starting.Their startups?
The bed and I think.Many positive words were.Spoken today, as you say, about the.Pound and the ERC now existing, as Rubén.Spoke to José, to you too.No, I don't talk.Much because of it, if possible, start.Perhaps with some thought of yours and.Then I open it for us,.Then I put it on the screen for him and.Absolutely for me, and as he said,.Wire also bet that the.Winning play was in supporting the community.Of developers and entrepreneurs.With the crisis, invoices and.Technological tools and licenses to build.The companies of the financial future with.Blogging projects, buying clips,.Coins, which are wallets, described.Stablecoins,.They mentioned stablecoins with Sidor,.It is exactly the work we are.Doing to be able to buy those stablecoins.With a Visa card, payments,.Final value movement, a.Very important part of building our network,.And it is working very closely with the Ibiza Council,.The Latin American ecosystem and the rest.Of the world, so for us it is.Exactly the bet we made, it is to be.Able to support those who are.Starting to.Build the companies of the financial future,.I like this advice, it also came out with.An idea,.We are also clients of.Jose's company and waiting and visas,.I think.The best advice I could give.Someone.In the dyeing industry who wants to start a business.Is to take a moment and think about.Which financial service they don't.Like how it's being offered, whatever it.And then take that step and say, "How.Can I do it better?
How much.Better can I do it?" And.If being good, well, God knows, it's.Better to earn a 30% margin on what.I'm selling.Start a company and then explore.What technology is out there to.Solve those problems, and create a.Product tailored to a specific.Problem, an offer that isn't.Personalized.It's like saying, "This is like I.'m using Windows XP, but.We have to use different.Versions.".Will be the node, maybe there will be some downside to the.Question of entrepreneurship with.Crowdsourcing.So I think.When Rubén talks about some.Experiences that weren't good, but at.Least for that, he emigrated from.Latin America to Canada when he was.Young, and the process of sending.Cash here was terrible.Yes, so I.Think TransferWay was the first one.I used, besides the...banks.Because they are my.Best experience and today I have 10 TransferWise accounts.To use many of them from.Latin America, as I said, they are.Doing a very good job in.Mexico, so I think that connects.With your question.Well, gentlemen, let's turn up the.Screen so he can talk a.Little bit about Startup Weekend, and I'd like to.Close my part by.Thanking you all very much for your time, your.Sincerity, the uniqueness of your.Answers, and your ideas, or how you.Inspire entrepreneurs.Here in Latin America to make the.Region grow faster so that we can.Understand the leadership position.So, thank you all very much,.And I hope to speak to you again soon.Well, he and I.Will...thank you all very much, thank you very much,.Roberto, and well, I.Am Eloy Becerril, I am the regional manager.For Latin America of the.Community programs in Texts, and I also want to.Give you an additional piece of advice from the.Panelists, which is to start your own business right now, go ahead and.Participate in the.Next Texts Weekend, in blogs,.Link with Visas and with Stellar.We're currently.Developing.This project, this great event, so that.All the ideas.Discussed in this panel, and many.Other financial problems that need.Solving in the region,.Can be brought together with people from all over.Latin America who are also interested in.Entrepreneurship,.Blogging, and giving.Finance a different perspective.We'll be.Working over a weekend.Where you can take your idea a.Step further, to a prototype, to a.Validated model.We'll have a.Fantastic group of mentors and judges.During this weekend who will.Surely help you connect.And learn a great deal.If you want to skip to the next.Slide, Robert, it's a.Completely immersive and 100% online experience.On.Day one, you'll share your idea with.The entire group of participants, and.These multidisciplinary teams will be formed.With people from different parts of.To give you an idea, we already have.People registered from.Mexico, Argentina, Costa Rica, the.Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and even some.Spanish-speaking friends in Spain.So, we're really connecting the.Spanish-speaking community to the wider community.Latin American women are getting down to.Work and transforming finance in.Latin America with Block Sing.Saturday, the 2nd, we have.A phenomenal group of.Industry experts who have worked in.Different startups and.Financial organizations across.Latin America, and who.Also lead Block Change communities in the region.They will be your.Mentors, guiding you.Through the day to create a prototype and.Business model that makes sense, as.The panelists discussed.Finally, on.Sunday, the 3rd, you will present everything you.Built over the weekend in a.Pitch format.To a jury.Thanks to Avisa and the.Measurement program, we will have.Special prizes, and if that weren't enough,.All the money raised from.Ticket sales will go to.Laboratorio Punto de Lea, a.Non-profit organization that.Seeks to bring greater diversity and.Opportunities for women in.Latin America so they can continue.Developing by learning to.Program.So, it's an event with.Many positive aspects; it's a great.Opportunity, as they already mentioned, to...Entrepreneurship.In Latin America continues this momentum.To transform finance in the region.This event will take place.Next weekend, from October 15th to 17th,.100% online for everyone in.The page is sw blog.Change latam dot 0.For joining us.At this event, you have a.Special 50%.Discount code: sw l 50.We hope you can.Share this event with.People in your community and join us.Next.Weekend, starting October 15th.Thank.You so much for.Making this happen.It's a privilege to promote this.Initiative and.Encourage everyone.Participating here to.Join the event.Thank you again to the panelists and.Everyone who joined us.I'll.Stay a few minutes to.Answer some questions in the chat,.But that's all for today.Thank God, and have a.Great rest of the week.
