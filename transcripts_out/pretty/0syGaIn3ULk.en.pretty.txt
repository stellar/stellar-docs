Hello and welcome everyone to this.Week's Stellar Developer Meeting..Today in the studio I have Vivo from.Halaps and he's going to give a super.Exciting demo of the pro current.Progress of the scaffold Stellar.So.Please introduce yourself and yeah give.Us a little bit of just a small.Introduction to what is scaffold stella.To those who have not played around.With it yet or haven't heard a lot about.It.So yeah. awesome.Yeah thanks so much Carson.Hey guys I'm Fifo I'm work at a labs.I'm a principal engineer there and I'll.Be presenting the scaffold Stellar..For those that don't know about it, it's.Basically it it includes a CLI and a.Base project in which you can start.Developing on Stellar and Soroban in a.Very easy way.You can think of it as an.All-in-one repo and a lot of very.Helpful tooling around it for you to to.Build your contracts, deploy, test it,.Have your own environment configuring.The way they best suit your application.And really move fast at these initial.Process and the whole the whole.Development cycle.So, I'm very excited.To share this with you guys. Yeah.And when when I heard about the.Project for the first time, I thought.This is a great way if you're new to.Stellar, great way to get started.Has a lot of cool plugins.But as as I.Dig deeper into it, even as a more.Experienced developer, I actually see a.Lot of benefits from from using this to.Kind of bootstrap my my application if I.Want to try something new or build.Something where I don't want to spend a.Lot of time on setting up my environment.And do do basic stuff.So this.Especially I think some of the open.Sllin integrations are super exciting as.Well.So so I the more I look into it.The more I think this this is not only.Cool for new developers actually also.More experienced developers who just.Want to get going and build something .Without spending a lot of time on on.Setting up their environment. Exactly.I I think you said it all and.It's what I think it's great about it is.That it helps not just new developers.That are coming to the ecosystem and.Don't really know Stellar that well.They might have like those common.Initial hurdles when starting projects.And and start playing around but it also.Helps like seasoned developers that know.The ecosystem because you can really.Customize stuff around to make like work.In the way you feel more comfortable and.Can really move fast and try things.Really fast.So I love it.I've been.Working ser for for for some time and.I've missed this kind of tool in the.Past.And that's that's one of the.Things that I really like about it.Because all of you guys who are working.On this building this you're very you're.Very experienced on on the Stella.Platform and and you make things very.Customizable customizable so you can set.It up and you can customize your.Settings your features what you want to.Include.So so it's it's nice to see.That more experienced developer approach.To it as well. but you don't have to.Set up a lot of stuff if you just want.To get started and want to play with it.Out of the box.But but let's .Let's get into it and and and see what. what you guys have been working on. Awesome.Awesome.Just double checking.Can you guys see my screen?
Is.Everything okay?
Everything okay?
Everything okay?
 Awesome.So sometime people's.Complain that my my monitor has like big.Resolutions.If things are too small,.Just let me know.I can I can increase.It a little further.So I'll just start.With with the basic.Here you're seeing.The the link to Stellar CLI and I'll.Take these steps back and start from the.Very beginning.So if you're a new.Developer coming to the ecosystem not.Sure if you heard it up it already but.Stellar CLI it's a great tool everyone.Should have it and it's the the starting.Point for what we're doing here.So I.Recommend you go here to to Stellar.Stellar CLI get the CLI installed and.We'll start with it.So Stellar CLI has.A lot of very very exciting features.You can manage accounts.You can spin up.Your own container with a local network.You can do a bunch of of really cool.Stuff.But the nice thing that just came.In recently and a lot of people might.Not have realized in in in past .Releases is that now we have plugins for.The CLI.So if you have the CLI.Installed and you just go ahead and hit.Stellar Stellar space plugin and.Let's call search, you'll be able to.Search for plugins that are are.Published in the ecosystem and that can.Be installed on the CLI.So the idea.Behind that is that different projects.Might have specific needs or might look.For more personalized tooling for what.They're building and this way you can.Really customize your experience around.So what we're seeing here is.Basically it went through repositories.That have a specific tag it looks for.I.Mean these were. zoom in a little bit.It's it's a little.Bit hard to see. Yes, absolutely.Yeah.Is it better like.That?
Like that it's huge my screen.Now it's now it's.Really good.It's very easy to see.So basically it just.Found for hits and it's looking on.GitHub for a specific tag to indicate.This is a plug-in for the CLI and we can.See a bunch of interesting stuff.Already.So there is the scaffold.Stellar it's in a repository called a.Lababscaffold Stellar there's also you.Can see the contract bindings there is.The open zeppelink upgrader so the cla.For for contracts and we should be.Seeing a lot of a lot more exciting.Stuff coming next so for this demo .We'll go with the scaffold Stellar I.Already have it installed I'll just open.The repo here you can access github.And iabscaffoldstellar.And you can go through the instructions.Here to It's very simple.Just cargo.Install and you have the CLI.I already.Have it here.So, it's probably just.Yeah, there you go.I have P V P V P V P.V P V P V P V P V P V P V 005. we.Also have the registry which is.Something really exciting but I won't be.Focusing too much on this on this on.This demo in function of time.So, I.Think we can have subsequent sessions.Just to go deeper into some of the.Features that won't be here.I'll try to.Focus more on initializing the the.Project and and playing around with it.So, I have it installed.Once you have.The plug-in installed, you can access.Those through the Stellar CLA directly.So I'll go with Stellar scaffold.Just.Hit h to see the help and you get a.Bunch of new commands with the this.Plug-in.So in it will allows you allow.You to start a new project from scratch.And it comes with this pretty exciting.Model repo that you can manage your.Contracts.You can build the contracts,.Generate the clients, have you have a.Front end that's ready to interact and.Integrate with these clients.So it's.Really neat.You have a build a build.Function that not just builds the.Contract but also runs certain routines.That I'll be showing afterwards that are.Associated with the configuration you.Have in your environment.You have also.The generate command which allows you to.Generate new contracts.So these.Allow you to go through through the.Open Zeppelink examples and it can send.You to the to the OpenZeppelin wizard.And there's a bunch of new stuff coming.In the future as well. you can.Upgrade existing repositories for the.Scaffold turning into your your.Workspace into a scaffold project.There's the update just to update your.Environments in in your in your working.Space and also watch which I'll be.Using a lot in this demo that builds.Everything and keep watching for changes.On both sides.So both the contracts and.Also the front end.So for this let's go.Ahead and and start new project.I'll.Just go with Stellar scaffold in it.And let's call it demo 10.I think I.Have a bunch of demos already in this.Folder because I was playing with this.Throughout these past few days.Let's.Just see.Yes, cd.I'll just open this.New project.And you can see here that.It downloaded the repository from.Scaffold Stellar front end.So if you.Want to have a look at these or even.Submit PRs if you find anything to.Improve feel free to do that.So I'll go.Ahead and see the demo.I'm in the in.The folder and let me open it with VS.Code.So there's my VS Code.Let me just.Position it here and really increase.This so you guys can see what's going.On.So all right, starting in this new.Repo.What do I have in here?
What where.Is this structure?
What am I seeing in.This?
So just a quick walk through what.You're seeing here on top you have a.Folder for contracts and this is.Basically where your contracts are going.To live.They are following this format.In which you have a directory for each f.For each contract you have the cargo.Tommo source and out of the bat you can.See we have three examples. this is.Something that as is in this current.Format and also it's important to bring.The disclaimer that everything here is a.Work in progress.This is very recent.So if you see any bugs or anything that.We could be improved, feel free to to to.Share your feedback.We appreciate and.There's definitely a lot of stuff that.Will be iterating and improving over the.The new releases, the following.Releases.So you see under contracts.Here, I have a funible token from the.Demos.I have a hello world example and.I have the NFT innumerable which is also.Different example of contract.Contracts is where your rust code.Exists.This is all a big workspace and.You can see the the source code.Directly.If you scroll a little bit,.You see packages.Right now, this is.Empty.So where is this packages folder?
Empty.So where is this packages folder?
The idea is that as I'm building these.The idea is that as I'm building these.Contracts, we are automatically.Going through our configuration and.Deploying these contracts and generating.The TypeScript binds.So we are creating. clients for these in Typescript and.Putting those in this folder.So all the.Clients that are generated for the.Contracts will come to the package.Folder and that's where they're going to.Be accessed from.So if I go down below.You'll see that we also have a front end.Here.So this is a this is a ReactJS.With TypeScript and D and here in this.Front end basically it is a a very .Bare bones and simple front end to start.Playing with your contract.But it also.Includes some some interesting thing the.Bat.You're going to see it has some.Providers and some hooks that you can.Use in your application and you can see.The actual implementation we have in.Place to play around with those. you.Also have the contracts folder which for.Now it's empty but as soon as I start.Building the the contracts you see it's.Being populated with the clients for.Each contract and you have the debug.Folder which is this interesting.Contract explorer that is very similar.To what we have in Stellar lab and I'll.Get into more details in a second.For now it's bare bones.We don't have.Anything.So what can we do?
What can we.Start doing with this?
the first.Step, let me go ahead and just open the.Rhymi here.And it suggests us to start.With this copying the amp.So I'll just.Copy the example end.Now we have the.End.And this is basically telling us.Which environment are we using.This is.Where our front end is going to look.When connecting to our RPC and to our.Horizon.Oh, and I didn't mention what I.Actually Let me just show here because.I'm so used to have this up and running.I'm already running my local image of.The the the quick start.So if you never.Heard of it, if you don't you don't know.What it is, basically in the Stellar.CLI, you have a container.You can run.Stellar container start and you start.This container locally, a docker.Container with an image that has all.That you need to run Stellar locally.You have your own node running locally.From scratch pream pristine node.History.You have your own RPC.You have.Your own horizon.You you have your.Friend bot.So it's really handy..Right now I'll be using it to connect.And deploying everything locally in my.Environment.And just an example I.Was showing the the the commands from.The from the scaffold CLI.To show you these relationship between.Contracts and packages.I'll go ahead.And just run a build so you can see how.It does. basically if I access.Stellar.Scaffold.Build let me just do the the help so.You can see all the options.Basically you can build for a specific.Amp and it's going to look for this.Stellar scaffold and which points to.Which environment you are building your. I have mine already set.Here to development.So you can build.Your contracts for for different.Environments.And what these are doing.Is that they are also looking into this.File over here.This environment to this.Is very important for this scaffold.Project because this defines how you're.Handling this environment.So I I.Suggest you all have a look and play.Around.There's a ton of comments here.To guide you through this configuration.But in short summary, what you're seeing.Is you have three main environments.You.See here we have a development.Environment with the configuration for.The RPC that we'll be using the.Passphrase setting up to run.Automatically.So when this flag is set.For example and I'm running npm rundev,.It's going to automatically start the.Container for me.So I don't have to do.That or in case I forget.I do this all.The time whenever I'm working on my.Projects. you also have some other.Configuration around the accounts.This is also very neat.I'll get to into.More details but important things here.Is that you also have other.You have the staging.You have the production.So normally you would have.Development pointing to local.You would.Have staging pointing to test net or.Future net.And then you'd have.Production pointing to mainet.Won't make any changes right now just to.Show you guys.If I run the command to.Scaff Stellar scaffold build with the.Flag build clients. there you go.It's it's starting.To run.You see that it's doing a lot of.Let me just break it down for.So basically what it's going.Through it's going through all my.Contracts building each one of those.As.They're building the contracts they're.Also looking at these environments to.See what I have set up here.So .Important pieces.So first thing you'll.Notice you have this development.ac.Accounts which defines which accounts.Are going to be used and by default you.Have this with an account called me and.The full true.What does that mean?
That.Means that if you're familiar with the. Stellar CLI you have the Stellar keys.Which allow you to if I just hit ls here.I can you can see the keys I have.Allow you to manage key pairs directly.From the CLI.So you can create new key.Pairs, you can initialize these accounts.And you can use these accounts to run.Transactions directly through the CLI.So the nice thing here is that as you.Set these accounts here automatically.Doing the build, it's going to identify.If I have an account called me or not.And in case I don't, it's going to.Create this account and initialize it.For me.And with the default equals true.Flag, it is going to use this account to.Deploy the contracts as the source of.The transactions.So for example, if you.Are spinning up a bunch of contracts.Which have the same admin, you could set.Up this as the admin account and have.The admin deploy all the contracts.Down below you have here also the.Development contracts which specifies.Which contracts the build command should. should build for these .So here for example it.Comes out of the bat already.Preconfigured with the contracts we have.Here as examples.So you have the hello.World and this inline syntax saying.That I want to generate the client for.So basically the hello world down.Below we have the funible token which.Also is generating the clients but you.Can see down below it has something.Else.You can already set the.Constructor args directly into this.Format and you can use the accounts that.Are specified on top to be used.Parameters as arguments.So here it's.Already invoking the constructor.Arguments sorry the constructor function.For my funible token setting the owner.As the MI account and an initial supply.And the same thing for the NFT contract.As well.It's set in the owner and you.Can also play around with these because.You can add post initialization.Commands.So you can have for example.This after deploy and you can chain new.Commands after everything is deployed if.You want to run a specific.Configuration.So let's say that after.Deploying everything and initializing.The contract you already want out of the.Bat to mint some units to send to some.Accounts to send around some tokens.You can do that very easily.So you see.A lot of stuff ran here.Actually I.Ended up jumping a few steps.So we.Just have the the the contracts and the.Packages and you can see those were.Generated based on the contracts we have.Specified here.So all of the TypeScript.Packages and this also filled in the.Contracts for my front end.So we can.Start playing with this front end.All.Right.So let's let's get back to.Repository.I just initialized this.Project.What are the steps that I need.To do as a fresh project?
So we just.Copied the MV.Now what we need to do,.We need to install the dependencies.Because we have a bunch of of .Dependencies that we are going to need.For example to run the concurrency and.So on.So npmi just run the.Installation.Wait a little bit.Let's just close this other one for a.Second.Okay, everything's installed.What is the next step?
Npm rundev.So as.You run npm rundev, you see a lot of.Things going on here.And this is where.I think the magic lies.So, and yeah,.Run that.And a lot of stuff is running.I'll just go back and show you as it's.Scrolling down.So, you see that out of.The bat, it starts concurrently two.It starts Stellar scaffold.Watch with the build client flag and.Also vit.So, these go two are running.In separate process.You can see right.Away that vit's running here on number.One and on number zero.You can see the.Whole building the building .Commands that I that I showed before.I'll go ahead and click here to open the.Front end.It's already there.And let.Me just see if it finished building.Everything we had already built.Basically just repeated everything.But.There we go.We have our front end.It's a very simple one. it.Starts with some instructions telling.You what you can do and how you can do.But let me just break it down what.You're seeing here in your interface.Back. first thing you notice it came.Automatically connected to my account.Why is that FIFO?
Well, that's mainly.Because I have been using this already.And we we we have some account.Management logic here that stores.Locally in the local storage the account.That is last connected.So once you come.Back it's going to identify it has been.Connected and just reused that one.I can just come on top here and switch.Accounts like or I can come here click.On something.There you go.Click and.Disconnect if you want to see what is.The the fresh start for the first time.You access. what is important to note.Here here I'm using freighter and if.You're using freighter you should set it.To a custom network because I'm using.The local one.So if you never done that.In the past you go to settings navigate.To network and you can set here a custom.Network.If you're running on test net.Or mainet you're good to go because you.Can simply select the networks that.You're running.But in case of a custom.One, you just need to input the same.Parameters we have in the end.So what.Is your RPC URL?
What is your horizon.URL?
What is the passphrase and allow.For HTTP connections?
there is.Something on my my my local environment.Here and I'm still trying to figure out.What is going on.But sometimes it.Struggles with freighter and it doesn't.Show up the the proper balance.But I.See it's something related specifically.To this to this environment I'm running.But it's it's going to work.Everything.Is fine.I'll be showing to you guys.So, if I click here on connect, you see.That we're using the Stellar wallet kit.This is a nice library we have in the.Ecosystem, which basically connects to.Several different wallets in the.Ecosystems and it's just one integration.You make and you're good to go.So, here. I have these two wallets installed.Here, but it supports way more wallets.I'll just go with Freder.And wait a.Did I click it?
Oh, something's.Going on.What happened?
Oh, there you.Go.Not sure what happened.I think my.My my computer is frying because.Everything just slowed down.Oh my god. I'm not sure what's going on.Let me.Just double check if it's there's an.Issue here.Right is not available.Oh,.What is going on?
Did my did my plugin.Just just die?
Just just die?
Just just die?
Oh, what the hell happened here?
Oh, what the hell happened here?
Oh, what the hell happened here?
Let me just Yeah, I should definitely.Let me just Yeah, I should definitely.Open the tickets with Fred.Try and.Kill everything from scratch.Oh, no.Can't do that.Otherwise, I'll be out of.The session.Let me just try it again.Once., is there a way I can maybe.Restart the extension?
Restart the extension?
Restart the extension?
, where is Can I just do this and., where is Can I just do this and.Bring it back?
Bring it back?
Bring it back?
Let me see.Oh, there you go.It's popping me for.My password.Is this correct?
There you.Okay, I think it's going on now.Not.Sure what's going on.I'll definitely.Open a ticket for for the demo gods.Blessing us.Okay, so I connected my freighter.Wallet.What you see here, it.Automatically brings the balance and we.Have this small indicator here in the.Top which checks what is the.Environment that you have set here in.Your local environment and it indicates.If you're connected to that or in case.You're not in case I'm connected to test.Net for example in the wallet it's going.To to throw a different message and.Indicator just so you know that you're.Not in the intended environment because.We want these front ends to be built for.A specific environment.So here I'm.Connected with my FIFO wallet and there.You go.What can I do FIFO?
What can.This front end do for me?
What can I.What can I use this for?
So the nice.Thing starts once we click on this.Button over at the top.So if you're.Familiar with Stellar lab the.Laboratory.You have a functionality.There called I think it's called.Contract explorer as well that has the.Invoke contract tab.Basically what we.Did is that we ported a good part of.That implementation over to here.And a.Big shout out to to to to the team from.From Stellar Lab that helped us through.The process.And what you're seeing here is that as I.Open my front end, it automatically goes.Through my packages and the contracts I.Have here.They load the clients, they.Load the wasmas, they bring the whole .Spec for the client and show me this.Interface which allows me to directly.Interact with the contract in my local.So what you're seeing here.Are the three contracts I have here.Can simply click and switch which.Contract I'm interact with and I can.Start invoking transaction invoking.Functions from here.So I'll just go and.And show some examples.Let's go through.The hello world.And if we check the.Hello world contract, basically what it.Does is that it has this hello function.Which receives an argument for two and.Say hello hello to the two arguments.So I'll go ahead and just say fo and.Since I have my account connected I can.Both simulate or submit.I'll break.Those into details.So I'll start just.With simulate.If I click simulate it's.Basically running the simulation of the.Transaction.And you see some stuff.Already changed.So okay, what changed.Here?
First thing is it is using my.Account that is connected here as the.Source account of the transaction and is.Simulating an invocation with the.Parameters that I'm putting here.Can see on top that it it showed this.Flag to indicate it is a read.Invocation.So that means that if I go.Ahead and submit this invocation to to.The network and it is processed, there's.No change in state.We're not changing.Any state of the contract.So there's no.Real reason to actually submit and pay.For the fees.If we just want to fetch.Some value or see some result, we can.Just simulate and see the result which.Is what we have down below.Here we have.The response and the result of the.Simulation.So it is a successful one.And you can click here on show details.And you expand the whole view and you.Have the entire response.Scroll down if you're familiar with.This, you see that we have these results.Object and here we can see the the.Return value.So it's saying hello FIFO.With the parameter that I use.So if I.Say something different like hello John.I'll simulate again.Show the details.Go down below and there you go.Hello.John.What else can you do?
.Let's try a different thing. let's.For example let's switch here and.Make a new function and let's make some.Changes.Let's store a value.Think things start to get interesting as.You start playing with your contracts.And and and change things around.So,.I'll just store let's say what can we.Send here?
Let's send an address.So, .Let's send an address.And it's address we don't return.Anything and we'll just store these in.The in the storage.So just go ahead.M.Do storage.Copilot.Let me just double check.Set.No, this.Is wrong.This is wrong.Damn it.So storage instance.Let's use.Instance for now.Is I have cold hands. instance set.Okay. let's use a.Simple key.So single short.Might have to import this single short.Let's just call my key for now.And the.Value will be the address that we're.Sending.Okay, let me just save.Let's see.Where.Am I?
Oh, this should be There you.Let me just save it again.I think.This is good to go.Let's wait a little.Bit.You see that as soon as I'm saving.Everything is running again.So, it's.Watching for changes in real time.And.As it identifies that I changed the the.The the contract and it builds and it.Notices that was different.Then it runs.The whole routine.So it redeploys,.Reinitializes.And this is very very.Powerful because it means that as I'm.Making changes, it's identifying when.It's relevant and it redeploys.Regenerates everything.And if you paid.Attention, you should have seen that the.Front end already updated here on the.Side.So I already have the starv.Showing up in here.So that's really.Neat because it means that as I'm making.Changes, I can already invoke from the.So the star val here allow me.To send an address.So I'll just copy my.On address from here.We should.Definitely add the copy button here.I'll just paste it here.I'll simulate.I see that I can send it.I can submit.This.But if you notice here on top now,.The badge is slightly different.Close this.You see now it indicates.It's a right invocation.So this means.That based on this simulation if I.Submit this I'll be changing some.Value and storing some value in the.Contract.So I'll go ahead I'll click in.Submit and it's popping me up to sign. this is just because of the the issue.I mentioned here in my environment.Sometimes don't know I have balance but.There you go it was executed and here it.Is.This is this oh damn it one password.It's going to be popping up.You're seeing here is the result of the.Submission and this is is slightly.Different.So it has the same compact.Version but I can click on details and I.Can expand.Oh should I just close this?
Can expand.Oh should I just close this?
Can I just Yeah, let me just finish it.Can I just Yeah, let me just finish it.One password.You're seeing here as the the summary.You have the hash of the transaction.Have the ledger number for when it was.Processed.you have the transaction.Envelope in XDR, but you can also click.Here and quickly switch to JSON and view.The the JSON version of this object.The same thing for the result.You can.Convert it to JSON and so on.So, this.Is really nice.Oh, did it just.Reopen?
That's awful.Oh, it's.Because of this one.Let me just how.Can I can I just disable it?
Let me just.Go to the extensions real quick and.Disable this guy so it doesn't pop up on.Our face.Okay, I was talking about the.Submission.So, I just submitted made a.Change.What else is important to.Highlight here as you're playing with.These contracts and and you might have.Noticed already all of the functions are.Loaded here with their specific.Arguments and the specific types that.These arguments are in.So for example,.If you're looking here to the hello, it.Expects an SC string.So it's only.Accepting strings.So as I'm typing.Here, it's validating the the the input.That I'm providing.So for example, here.It expects an address for the store.If.I put anything else other than an.Address,.You'll see that it's validating and.Telling me, hey, this is not a public.Key or a contract ID.So it needs to be.A valid address.And you should see this.For all of your functions, all of the.The known types.So if you go here over.The funible token for example, you see.We have all of these types indicated.Here along with the fields.So we have.Here I 128 and so on.And for functions.That don't have like arguments don't.Expect arguments you just see this.Compact version.So you can just check.And simulate like hey is this paused?
.Yes it's not paused returns false.This is really useful.Okay what else?
What what else can we.See here?
Let me take a step back and.See what I took notes.See if I'm not.Forgetting anything.Oh, yes.As you're.Seeing here on top, we have the name of.The contract and the contract ID.Can just copy it if you're playing.Around making direct invocations in the.In the CLI, but you can also click here.On show details.And that's very.Interesting.So, what you're seeing here.Is the additional data about this.So here you have the contract.Was hash if you want to play with the.Deployed was version. you also have.The contract metadata and if you're not.Familiar with with what is the contract.Metadata you can just come here and.Click to see the documentation and read.A little bit more but in essence these.Are some some some some pieces of data.That are automatically embedded into the.Was that included into the the was.During the compilation but you can also.Add your own custom metadata depending.On what you want to send to to the to.The to the deployed version of the.So basically what we're doing.Here is that in this front end once we.Are going through the the our clients.And identifying that we have clients for.These contracts we are also getting.Their wasmas getting the was hash.Getting the wasmas and decoding the.Was to extract this metadata.So if you connect for.Example this to contract deploying test.Net this is also going to work and pull.All of the metadata related to that.Let's just go ahead and make.Some changes and add some metadata to.This contract.So let's go into this.Hello world contract.It has just the.Basic metadata here indicating the.Version, the SDK version, the protocol.Version and release.So I'll just go.Ahead and there are a few ways in which.You can do this.One that is very simple.Is directly through the tommo file.I'll just copy here and go to the tommo.File and I'll add this section here for.Package metadata.Stellar.And we have some some some some.Different properties here basically.Indicating this is a contract.I have.Some custom ones like I have my custom.String fu my custom boot through.We.Have authors we have the repository the.Homepage and all of these are going to.Be baked into the contract during the.Build.You can also beyond this you can.Also come here and this is something you.Can do in your own contracts which is to.Use the macro contract contract.Matter there you go let me just make.Sure it's imported and for contract.Matter all you need to do is to form a.Key which I'll just say my. my key that's more than enough and a.Value so for the value I'll just call.I'll just say fifu. oh yeah there we go.Let me just save.It will also rerun everything.So let's.Just wait a little bit and as it's doing.Basically everything is going to be.Included into the was during the.Compilation and once we load it in the.Front end we are going to decode from.The wasp and and and present it show in.The front end.So I think everything has.Run here.Let me just go and there you.You see we have a bunch of new stuff.Popping up now.So all the keys that I.Have included through the tommo plus the.Key I included here.So let me just see.My key foil here on top is of type meta.Entry.We have the other traditional.Ones.We have the outs that came from.The tommo.We have contract true the.Home domain and so on.So that's very.Powerful and if you want to reuse this.In your project you can just grab these.Components and reusing the front end.App.And in the same way way something.That we we were conscious about here is.That all of this contract explorer.Capability and and functionality is not.Something that you want to ship to your.Production environment for example.Everything that you see related to this.Page is tightly organized within the.Debug directory.So you can easily just.Delete this this debug directory and.Extract everything and you'll be have a.Clean project.And also if you want to.Just reuse some bits, you can just go.Select the components and reuse those in.Your project.So moving forward, okay,.We made some changes. I updated the.Metadata.What else can we do?
So you.Remember I was telling you about the.Environments and let me just go ahead.Here and find the file environments.Which is the file that allows us to make.Some configuration about the.Environment we're working on.So I'll.Just go ahead here and have a look at.The NFT one.And for the NFT one, we see.That all it has said is we have we want.To we want to build clients for this.Contract and we also are constructing.This with me the MI account as the.Owner.So what if we also wanna let's.Say men some some units of it.So let me.Go ahead and grab this which is the.Example we have here and I basically am.Going to add a after deploy and here we.Can just chain different commands we.Want to run after the deploy.So here in.This example I'll just going go around.And but let me see what is the actual.Syntax for this contract.NFT.Innumerable. contract and the constructor.Okay,.So it's a nouner and it's an address.That's where sorry not the constructor,.The mint.So it's two and an address.Let me go to the.So mint two and then an.Address.I'll just delete this.I just.Give the name of the the address and.It should be able as I.Make new deployments, it should be able.To do it.Now, even though it's running,.I didn't change anything in the.So, it's not going to identify.Changes in the was.So, it's not going.To deploy a new was for me.So, I'll.Just go ahead and make a change to this.So, one thing that we can take.Advantage of this update and I already.Highlighted that we can also add rest.Docs here as comments.So for example we.Can say that this no it doesn't.Returns the owner the contract no.Copilot this is a mint a new token to.Specified address color must be and so.On okay this is good enough let me just.Leave these two lines so once we have.These docs on top of the functions.And we save these are going to be.Included in the w and in the spec of the.So when we are loading the.Front end, we are going to identify this.And show those alongside with the.Functions.So let's just wait a second.It's running everything.You should be.Seeing this sometimes blinking a little.This means that there's a lot of.Stuff going on and the the vit is.Watching for these changes and just.Updating everything.So running.Just for let me just double check.I think everything executed. have a look. it's the enumerable.Let me just see if Oh yeah, got to have.A look why it didn't just up there.But there it is. I put.It into into lines.This is very small.It should expand a little bit further.So a lot of stuff to take notes as.Improvements, but basically it brings.The the rust doc here.We have some.Indications and it's going to always.Show up with the the functions that that.They are attached to.So, okay, I added.The step to mint and and and already.Send that to the address which is what.Is the name of the address?
Me.So, let.Me go ahead and get this address.What.Is the key?
So, Stellar keys public.Key me.No, isn't that Oh, I added a a K.And again a typo.Oh, yeah, but it.Worked.So, this is the MI account.Let me check if it has a balance.Simulate.We see read.Successful.Let me check the balance.And it has.Here it is.Has.It has a balance of one one NFT.If I check I think we have another.Function here owner off and the token.ID.So we know that this is the.Sequential token.So the token number.Zero will be the first one.Yes, I can.Simulate and see that the owner.Is the address of my admin.Some other.Stuff you could be doing and it's very.Helpful here.So, I use this key, but.Sometimes I don't have those in my my.Wallets.So, you can use Stellar keys to.Also grab the private keys and import.In your wallets if you want to run some.Functions for example from the admin.Perspective.So I'll go with Stellar.Keys secret if I'm not mistaken me.That's the secret of the.MI account.So I'll just go ahead and.Freighter.And for freighter we have here you click.On this icon on top.You see your.Accounts and you can easily click on.Import secret key.I just paste it.Remember if you're seeing the secret key.Publicly in this recording you should be.Using this for real because this has.Been exposed.Let me just put my.Password.And don't forget to click on.This checkbox and I'll just import it.AM2 I.Yes, that's.Correct.That's the account.All right.So, I'm connected with my admin now.If I want to play around and I want to.Make transactions or means from the.Perspective of the owner, I can do that.So, I just go ahead for example, grab.The address of a different one which is.My FIFO account.I'll just come here,.Copy, and again switch to my admin,.Which is this one.And let me mint a.Token to my FIFO account.And one important thing here, you notice.That right away I can click on submit.You don't have to manually simulate.Can always simulate to see beforehand.What will be the the outcome if it is.Likely to fail or not.But you can just.Come here and directly click on submit.And it's going to run the whole.Workflow.So it's going to configure the.Transaction, simulate it, check the.Result, prepare the transaction, sign,.And then submit.So I will just click on.Submit.You'll be prompted to to to.Reveal and sign, approve and continue.Yes, that's correct.Sign transaction.And there you go.It was successfully.Executed.So, if I grab my FIFO account.Here now and check for the balance.And simulate, I should be able to see.That it holds a token.Oops.Too.Much scroll.Number one.It means it's hold holding.One NFD.And if I check for the owner of.The number one,.Let me see.Show details.Who is owning.The NFT number one?
There you go.The.FIFA account.Fifo, but you're just showing the.Examples we have here.You just made.Small tweaks.What else can we do?
What.Else is in there for us?
So, another.Nice thing that I want to show here.Today is the generate.So, if you go to.Let me just close let me stop this for a.While and close this one so you guys can.See this., let me just go to Stellar.Again.Show the commands.These are the.Commands we have.I want to show you the.Generate one.So the generate one is to.Generate new contracts in this.So let me go ahead Stellar.Scaffold generate and let me see the.Options we have here.So basically .Sorry I can generate contracts.Generate contract h and there you go.The options I have here I can clone one.Of the examples existing in the open.Zapping repository.And if you're not.Familiar let me just make sure I have it. this is the repository.It's.Managed by open zapling.They have some.Very nice examples over here that you.Can have a look.So basically you can.Choose any one of those and directly.Clone into the to the repository.Also have the option to list the.Existing ones which will show the list.Of the ones in the examples.Also go to the wizard.So it's going to.Pop up.Let me show you.If you hit.Contract,.Oops,.From wizard,.It pops up the wizard from open zap.Link.So, this is a really nice wizard.That allows you to combine different.Features.So, I want to make a token.That is mintable and it's burnable and.Pausible.So, it adds all of these.Characteristics and all the markers and.You can just grab it and bring to your.But what I'll be doing here is.Basically using the other option which.Is I'll go contract ls.Oh sorry it's a.Ls and here I can see all the available.Contracts in the open z.Ahead and copy one.I'll get.Let's let's use the funible CAP if I'm.Not mistaken.I think that's a good one.Let me just again check it's from.So I'll use from.So stylish scaffold.Generate contract from and I'll add it's.Fun how do you write it?
Funible cap.Funible.Cap.Is that correct?
I hope so.Yes.We have a new contract.So if you look here we have the.Contract funible cat.It was it was.Imported in our repository.So let me go.Ahead and also add it to our add it to.Our configuration.So it can be built.And then we can generate a client and so.And let me have a look.Does it have.A constructor?
Yes, it has a constructor.And expects a CAP interfere.So let's go.To our do we have it open?
No.Where is.It?
Environments.I'll go ahead and add a new contract.I'll use the same syntax we did for the.Token for the fun token.I'll just.Copy this. let me put it at the end.So I'll have a new one.And this one is.Funo.Kept.It's important that it matches the.Name.Let me see how it's set in the.Tunnel. where is the tunnel?
There you go.Example.So it's fun CAP example.But it needs to match the the final.File generated.So it should have the.Underscore.So, French ball CAP example.Client true.And we also.Want to.Invoke the constructor right afterwards,.But it accepts a CAP argument with an.Integer.So, I'll just say the CAP is.10,000.Just an arbitrary number.Let's save.Oh, sorry.I had.Stopped the command here.So, npm.Rundev.Let's see if it identifies the changes.Right away and and runs it.Let me go back.Here to see.But I think it.Didn't deploy it yet.Let's wait a.Little bit.Is it running?
Let me see.This teller.And so on.No, I think it's.Stopped.So, I should have run the.Command before I updated it.Let's just.Make a a small change so it detects the.I'll just add some comments.Maybe on this one.Still running.Sorry.Everything updated.Blinking for a while.Don't worry.Happens sometimes as we are removing and.Adding packages.Let me just double.Check if this is because we added a new.Package that not was not tracked.Know there is an open issue that the.Team is working was working today around.How we are tracking the newly generated.Packages.So sometimes we add a new.Package and it might not identify in the.Workspace.So we can so we just run the.Npmi here at the root level and it will.Identify.This is a quick workaround but.I know there they're patching it as we.Are presenting this.That was it. it's loading everything.We see a new one here.Funible CAP example we have our token .It does it have an admin let me just.Double check no it doesn't have an admin.So that means that I can just m with any.Account so let me check the total.Supply before we start invoking this.Contract and the total supply is indeed.Zero so there are no units in existence.Or running around so let's go ahead and.Mint some so I'll just mint to the to.Our admin or to our main account.Directly and you open here.Copy.Let's just use this one amount.Just use a normal amount that's under.The cap.So, this one should be okay.Because it's under the cap.Loading.Execute it.If I get this account and check the.Balance, simulate.And I.Run down here.5,000.So, the balance is.There.it was minted.So, let's go ahead.And try to mint 50,01.And this now shouldn't go ahead.So, if.I click both simulator submit, it fails.Because the simulation fails because we.Are hitting the cap.So, we should be.Able to see here the details of the.Failed simulation and what happened.As you see we just added a new contract.Started playing around and you see.Things gives us a lot of speed because.You can just start invoking everything.From the client and seeing the changes.Right away.So I think this is very.Powerful and should be very helpful for.New developers coming getting up to.Speed and seeing how the implementation.Is managing all these workflows and you.Should be seeing some improvements.Coming soon as we gather feedback and.Start adding more functionality to it.So, I'll pause for a second and take a.Sip of water just to to lubricate my my.Vocal cords.And Carson, I'm not sure if.We have any questions or if like to open.Up for anyone. I think we pretty much caught up.Questions, but if anyone has.Questions, please feel free to to ask. I think this this is a really this is.A really great demo that shows how much.Progress you've made on this.I love.That the tooling is built in.It makes.It super easy to debug and to develop.And add on to your smart contracts.You don't need to have a ton of tooling.Set up. it's all built in.It very very easy.So yeah, I I.Downloaded the and ran the the latest.That's at least the public one last.Night and it was super easy to get up.And running as as soon as I figured.Out that I needed to have my my Docker. running. I didn't have that.Was on pause.So after that.Everything was pretty smooth and and I.And and there was there was a comment. about about Stellar Lab you can.Actually connect Stellar Lab to quick.Start that works even if you have.Quick start and you have this running on.Your local machine you can still use .The web-based Stellar lab but but I.Think most of the functionality that.That that I would be interested in you.Already exposed those here like the.Smart contracts, you can invoke them and.You can see the output.So most of the.Functionality I use in cell lab is is.Already included in in this in this.Version.So yeah, amazing amazing job.It's great to hear that and I.Invite everyone to play around, test,.Share the feedback, especially people.Participating in the hackathons.Like.This is a great starter for the.Hackathons.They can really get up to.Speed.Yeah, I think for hack meridian,.We definitely need to do a big push to.Get people going on this. I we always.See when we do hackathons, we always see.Some struggle a little bit setting up.Their environment, get everything.Installed and sometimes they maybe spend.An hour getting things up and running.Instead of starting to code or to decide.What to build.So this is really a fast.Track to to get started working on.Your project and and start coding.And and we have some hidden gems.That I didn't even touch here because of.The time.But if I really suggest.You guys have a look.For example, we.Have some hooks that allow you to.Directly listen for specific events.If you're playing with events and.Meeting events in your contract, you can.Already in your front end start.Listening for those and reacting.So you could make some.Fancy stuff here.I think this could be.A next step for this explorer to have.Some options to already list and see the.Events coming up as you're making the.Invocations.But this could be very.Powerful.Great.If you guys find.Anything or have any any feedback, feel.Free to share directly in the repository.Or get get in touch with us.How is the best way?
Let's say I.Find a bug or something is not working.What is the best way to to to let you.Guys know?
Guys know?
Guys know?
 I encourage everyone to directly open. I encourage everyone to directly open.A niche on the repository because we are.Definitely looking there every day.Will be the quickest way, but we're also.On Discord.So on the developer Discord,.The developer community, we're always.So feel free to just tag us, me.Or the team.We're always looking there. Great.If there's no other questions,.I would like to thank you so much for.Giving this demo.This was a very.Extensive demo.you really took us far.Into into the scaffold Stellar and it.Was really great. so yeah, thank you.So much and I think we will probably do.Another update at a later time but.Until then I would encourage everyone. who builds on Stellar to try it out.It it's really impressive.I I love how.How much is included how much you.Don't need to set up manually and.Integrating the tooling and and getting.To a point where you start to be.Productive super fast.I think that's.That's that's a great experience. so.So so yeah, go ahead and try it out and. yeah, thank you for for listening in.We will be back next Thursday.Thank you.Everyone.
