.Lightning.Oh my gosh.Hello everyone.And welcome to this week's Stella.Developer meeting.Today we have two.Things on the on the program.We have.First G.She will present the the latest.Updates to Stellar Lab which I'm super.Excited about.It's a tool I use almost.Every day.And then later on Jane also.From the DevX team will join and talk.About upgradeable contract proposal.So let's get started.I think I think.It was in I think it was in December,.Early December we had the latest the.Last presentation of Stellar Labs but.A lot has happened since then.So I'm.Super excited about learning more.About the new features and yeah take.It away G.Yeah awesome.Thank you.Kirsten.Oh my god I'm so excited to see.Like Emir enlightenment in this chat.Hello my name is Gson. I'm on DevX.Team.We work on CLI, lab, quick start.And more things., but I'm primarily.Working on the lab and I'm very excited.To show you guys what we have what we.Have built so far for , smart.Contracts on Stellar., so I will.Share my screen and I'm going to share.My entire screen because I want to do.Some CLI work as well.So, can everybody.See me?
Okay, great. I think Carson,.Did you share my notion doc?
I am going.To do that right now.Please.Going to walk you guys through what.We're going to talk about today..First of all, we're going to go through.Overview of smart contract features on.Stellar.So contract explorer.We're.Going to take a look at blend pool.Contract and kale contract by Tyler and.Sort of like kind of go through like the.Each feature that we built.And the.Second of the presentation will be live.Demo which I might break something.I.Actually did break something back in.December.So who knows it might happen.Again.I hope not.I practiced but .Yeah I feel like in the world of AI.Actually breaking things is now like in.I think. so okay let's go to the lab.The our public lab. I should have removed this bar but.Okay whatever. so to use smart.Contract features we have to make sure.That our RPC URL is ready and I do have.That which is provided by overcat.Mainet.surbanpc.com.So thank you.Overkat for working on that. so this.Is.The new feature that we built. our.Team member IA built this. so big.Shout out to Ietta. so I'm going to.Copy this contract and bring it.Here and this is going to give me all.The information about blimppool contract.And this is we getting API for this from.Stellar the expert as you can see I have.Like power by Stellar expert here. so.Here we have it shows source code of.Blend which is how we verify that this.Build is you know verified. so on.Stellar unlike other some smart contract.Platforms we don't store source code on.So what we do here is we are.Checking GitHub action and making sure.That the commit that this GitHub action.Ran match the source code and that's how.We verify the contract here.And we have about 10,000 entries here.So it's it might take some time to load.This but this will show you all the.Storage that are available on this.Contract.Might take some.Time but yeah it like shows up here and.This will be really useful when you have.To extend TTL or restore footprint for.Contract storage. I will walk you.Through this later in the demo but yeah.We have a way to export this in.CSV.So we go here it will show you all.The XDR that we have., and like I.Said, I'll walk you through what we can.Do with do with this later., I'm just.Going to close this for now.And source.Code is coming up., contract spec is.Kind of like this is like our way of our.Version of Ethereum's AI., it shows.You the data types that this contract.Has and then functions that this.Contract has.And later demo I'm going.To show you what we can do with this.Contract spec to build some of the.Functionalities on the UI side and.Binding is coming up as.Well.So let's look at Kale.Kale's going to be a little different.Don't think it has verified yet, but it.Will show.Us how big their entry or their contract.Storage is.is like almost like 3.Million I think. so it might take.Some time to load but I just wanted to.Show you guys. it shows us all the.Version history and I'm not going to.Okay, I'll click contract storage.It.Has three million entries which is.Wild. but yeah, it.Shows all the information that we the.Users want to know about the contract on.The lab which is great.Yeah, failed to.Fetch. we'll show that later.it.Worked earlier., it might be too big., yeah.So, like here has all the.Functions and data types., we can.Also do XDR if you want.You can copy.You can also download the WASM.So,.Let's say you're building a contract to.Also want to interact with other.Contracts.You can download the WASOM.And deploy within your contract.And we.Also have smart contract.List which shows us all the smart.Contracts that are built. so at the.Moment everything is being rendered by.Front end.So what we are going to do to.Make.This load much faster we are going to.Work on implementing back end so that it.Will be more efficient and faster.But yeah, give it some.Time or I can also.Refresh.Should I.Refresh?
Let me refresh.Okay.Yes..So yeah, all the smart contracts are.Happening.I can just click on it and.Then we can just load it right away and.Check out what's going on.So yeah, so.That.Was the overview of smart contract.Features on Stellar.So what I'm going.To do next is kind of go through the.Live demo or like live coding or like.Building the contract and see how a.Developer can really utilize the lab to.Make their workflow much better.Going to build a contract on testn net. open zapland.Recently launched step 41 token.Standards here.So look at all this beautiful token.And I'm going to use James's tutorial to.Build like sample contract really fast. so James is actually using open.Zeppelin's mintable standard to get the.Contract working.So I already did .Let me duplicate it.So I already built.Cloned his repo and did the first five.Steps.So all I have to do is start.Deploy.So let's go to my let me just go.Like this.So Stellar keys.JSON.Stellar keys Stellar key.Ls there's address JSON I need to do my.Address okay so I'm going to.Do is the source who is responsible for.All the transaction and anything related.To this contract is going to be me JSON.And just to make this work easy.I'm I'm.Going to make the owner of this token.Contract my address and I'm gonna do I'm.Gonna limit my token at 10,000 and let's.Deploy this.I hope you.Work.Yes, it better.Work signing.Transaction.Okay, cool.So, that one is.Deployed.So this is our contract and I.Think what I want to show.You.Is our upcoming feature which is invoke.So the way we invoke contract.On the CLI is like this which I kind of.Find it a little difficult or it's not.Very intuitive.I love our CLI so don't.Get me wrong. and it would be sources.And let me actually show you.Another feature of the lab which is.A creating key pairs which is super.Useful. because I'm going to account.Generate account and I'm going to fund.This account with.Fbot.And you know when you like develop.On any contracts it can be really.Confusing with like all these public.Keys.So I'm going to save this key pair.And it's going to be testnet open.Zepp.Invoke account.And going to save key pairs and I'm.Going to copy.This go to my CLI and I'm going to mint.Th00and tokens to this.Account.Amazing.Yep.Successful.Great.So, if I go to. this contract on Stellar.Expert, we'll see two data entries.Yep,.GB.I just did that. what I'm going.To show you next is our upcoming.Feature, which is doing invoke.Contract on the lab.So, I've been.Working on this.It's been taking quite.Some time, but I am going to walk you.Through.First of all, I need.My.Keys address.Jason, which is this.I need this.I'm.On testnet.Patch this.I think I will.Need my private to sign later.No.Was.It styler case show?
Okay.Later to sign it.So what I'm going to.Do is I'm going to invoke not payment.Invoke contract and our contract was.This.One.Go to.This and I am able to fetch all these.Methods from contract spec that I showed.You earlier.So I'm going to do .Mint and let me reuse the account that I.Did here.I'm going to mint some more on.That account.I'm going to do prepare.Transaction which gives me this XDR.And.If you go to XDR view, it's going to.Tell me that contract address is this.I'm calling function mint and this is.The destination address and all the.Informations about what this TX is about.To do.So good.I I like this.It looks., it also tells you the.Resource fee.All right.I'm just going.To go ahead going to sign it and I'm.Going to sign it with this., don't.Ever do this.Don't ever show your.Secret key.I'm just doing this because.It's a demo and it's test net.So, I'm.Going to sign my transaction sign.Going to submit and transaction.Submitter.And same thing that we saw earlier.Looks good.Let's hope this.Works.And yes, it worked.Okay, so we.Have all these envelope XDR fee., I.Can go to view installer expert and it.Showed me that this transaction did.Indeed work.And if I go to this.Contract, it shows that mint did happen.And this all happened from the Stellar.Lab.And so yes, that worked., one last.Thing I want to show you is our ,.Popular.Stay wait., so we have a way to.Restore and extend TTL for contract.Storage and I'm going to show you how to.Do that.So let's go back to our.Contract which was this.And what you.Can do is that you can go to lab smart.This feature is live.Going to load this contract and in this.Contract storage we have this balance.And let's say this balance is like.Expired. in that case I can download.This go to the my CSV file and it will.Show me that there is a key instance is.A contract entire contract instance and.I need this is the contract storage .Contract storage key that I want to.Extend or restore.Then I just copy this.And let's check view XDR and see what.That contract storage key is about.If it's smart contract value and it.Tells me that this is the balance and.Address this and let's say I want to. extend footprint for that one and I.Think I have to go to my.Contract get this and get the SC.Valve right here.I'm just going to do.Testing 200 sequence ledger and resource.Fee and I have this button called fetch.Minimum resource fee for from RPC.Does all the simulating and everything.For you.And you go sign in transaction.And I think secret.Key is this.And we can.Submit the.And yep, we were able to.Extend our TTL for the contract.Storage.So yeah, GBTL extended logistic.Expression to sequence 200., so that's the demo that I have.,.You probably won't ever use extent.Because I think that should take care of.That and kind of same thing with restore.Footprint once protocol 23 comes.But.But you know the lab can support it.So.If you ever need it, just come to the.And that's the demo for today.It was super.Interesting to see all these new.Additions.And now I would like to.Invite Jane to the stage here who.Will give an update on one of the SCPs.All righty.Thanks for having me.Today I'd like to talk about upgradable.Sub which is a sub that defines how.Smart contracts can upgradeable up.Upgraded themselves and is contributed.By OpenZeppelin.They've been doing a.Lot of great work for us shipping.Funible token and also now NFT and.Upgradability and this is really a call.For the community to look at this app.And also look at the smart contract code.That they're shipping for us and add.Your comments.So as you know the.Contracts on Stellar are mutable by.Default and the mutability in Stellar.Ecosystem means a contract can modify.The wasome by code thereby altering its.Interface execution logic metadata.There are also cases where you want the.Contract to be immutable because it.Guarantees the trustless execution and.Application of the contract logic.So if.You think about blend that is a.Immutable contract but typically in a.More common case as you know defy.Protocols or if you're building a game.If you think about over time you might.Want to add more features.Functionalities to what you're building.You probably would want contract up.Upgradability.So in order to do that .We were working with OpenZeppelin and.We published the sap and Carson could.You share the set please?
Yeah I just .Shared it.So it creates a.Standard to define how smart contract.Should upgrade their was and by code and.Also talks about some of the caveats you.Should think about while you're.Upgrading such as a new contract.Shouldn't have a a constructor because.That constructor is never getting.Invoked or if your existing contract is.Upgradable.You should be careful not to.Upgrade to a contract that no longer has.So you're stuck there.Sorry users and you should check for.Storage consistencies making sure that.The the new contract does not introduce.Any storage mismatch and also one more.Thing we actually describe in the step.Is to add a metadata that describes the. the current sim.So essentially a new.Key value pair called BIMver and the.Value follows a singver standard major.Minor patch and that would describe to.The world of your contract and its.Upgradeable path over time and there is.A simple code in the sub which you can.See if we go down to that section. and it will basically define a public.Function upgradeable and get the owner's.Address require o and bas then call the.Up the updated current contract wasome.And put in the new wasome hash.So that.Is basically the SE and then if we go to.The open.Zeppelin s source code at github.com.OpenZeppelin contract.Utils.Here you can see that there is.Upgradable macros and this will make it.So that you can easily add this macros.To your contract And eventually it's.Going to be integrated into the open 7.Wizard., and you can decide if you.Want your contract to be upgradable and.Use these m macros.So this app is .Basically out there and we'd love to get.Your feedback.Please comment and.Provide us feedback and hopefully we'll.Get these audited and merged very soon.Thank you for the for the.Introduction and and yeah everyone.Please go to please go to the the the.Pull request and if you have any.Comments any questions any concerns.Please please write a comment and .Yeah we'll address it.I think that was.It for today.I I think this this was.This was really interesting both getting.An update on on Stellar Lab, but also.Getting an a view into one of the the.SAPs that are that are coming up and and.Really encouraging everyone to to to.Take a look at it and provide any.Feedback you have.That's it.That's all.We had for today. thank you everyone.For joining.We'll be back again next.Thursday.Take care.Bye.
