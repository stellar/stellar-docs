Hello everyone and welcome to this.Week's uh Stella developer meeting today.Um we have the team from blend joining.Us uh for a code walkr in support of.Their exciting news security Initiative.For the Stell ecosystem I'm Carson as.Usual from the SDF Dev team and um and.Alex will join us from script 3 and amen.From Satur uh to set the stage here uh.Blend is getting ready to launch their.Blend V2 and in preparation for that.They're opening up that code and for.Groundbreaking.$125,000 in usdc competition focused on.Securing lend V2 through both a.Competitive auditing and a formal.Verification this is the first ever open.Competition competitive audit and formal.Uh verification competition within the.Stella ecosystem so it's an amazing.Opportunity for Stella devs to try their.Hand on competing to find bugs and write.Formal verification rules I just get.More familiar with blend in general so.Um I'll post a link to how to sign up.For the competition the competition.Started this Monday so it is open uh but.Let me now introduce.Alex hello thanks for having me welcome.Alex.Um do you just let me know when I am.Ready to get running go ahead you are.All right perfect your screen all right.Thank you uh so yeah I am Alex you might.See me online as mots2 and I'm the lead.Developer at script 3 and we developed.Uh blend which is a universal liquidity.Protocol primitive uh just a quick.Overview what we're going to run through.We might go a wee bit fast because.There's a lot of stuff to cover um but.I'll give you guys a quick for those who.Aren't familiar uh just a quick.Breakdown of what blend is um how the.Actual contracts all work together um.And then I'll run into the code and kind.Of the main thing I'll try and focus on.Uh for those uh doing the auto.Competition is really going to be um how.We test blend and specifically if there.Is some kind of bug or thing you found.Within blend V2 uh kind of some tips and.Tricks on how you it might be a bit.Easier to prove um that something is in.Fact wrong um so yeah blend is a.Universal liquidity protocol primitive.And what does that mean uh basically.Blend is a tool that allows uh you know.Companies people who are crypto natives.Really any entity that wants a lending.Market to actually go ahead and have one.Um so lending markets the crypto are.Just places where people can uh land in.BIO assets from each other and one thing.That blend does is blend basically comes.With an automatic back stop module which.Acts as uh Insurance bad debt protection.And also scam protection and and these.Things these are funded by anyone uh and.Kind of the way this all works together.Is the pool will give some portion of.The interest it generates out to the.Back stop module such that it can.Provide uh that that layer of insurance.For the.Protocol um that's just a really brief.Intro as to what blend does um I want to.Touch on first uh actually how the.Contracts all work together since been.Looking at this from a security.Perspective knowing how uh the main.Components of blend interact um is.Pretty vitol so kind of the really like.Cornerstone part of blend is the emitter.Contract uh this doesn't have very many.Responsibilities it's core one is going.To roughly Define the admin protocol.Token in this case is blend um secondly.It's responsible for defining the back.Stop module now the back stop module is.Like I said earlier the contract that.Basically holds all of the insurance.Funds for the blend pools uh insurance.In this case are going to be um blend.Usdc LP tokens so there is a common amm.It's for those familiar with evm it's.Basically balancer um but it's just an.LP token for blend.Usdc um its main responsibility is it.Actually controls the state of the pool.So if you have a lending market and.There's a back stop module the back stop.Module actually has the ability to turn.The pool on and off so for example if.Something happens to a pool or it gets.Exploited some Oracle goes wrong um the.Back stop module actually has the.Ability to disable borrowing for the.Pool um secondly it's also the first.Less capital in the event of any bad.Debt and uh those that might not know.Bad debt is basically the case where um.A user has liabilities and they have no.Collateral to cover it so the protocol.Has to take a loss on that debt um.Secondly it also manages the blend.Emissions so the protocol basically.Starting from the emitter blend tokens.Will get sent to the back stop module.And it's the back stop module's.Responsibility to send it to all of the.Pools within the blend.Ecosystem um within the backstop module.Uh it also defines a pool Factory uh.This thing drops pretty simple it's a.Contract that contains a pool wasum and.For any pool that's created uh this is.The thing that validates that this is in.Fact a blend pool and it is the exact.Contract that we expect to be deployed.Um and then the meat and potatoes of the.Protocol is going to be the actual pool.Uh this is kind of the sort of a part of.The part of the whole protocol um it is.The place where people can go and lend.And borrow reserves um so there's tons.Of different ways you can set things up.Uh but this is kind of the place where.Um all the lending and borrowing occurs.And kind of where most user interaction.Will end up taking.Place um so I know that was really fast.But hopefully is this is being recorded.Right.Caren I think it is I'll take that as a.Yes um y it's recorded perfect so yeah.We can go we can go probably go back and.Watch that over if anything was missed.And I'm also available on Discord if uh.You want to ask further questions um but.We will jump to the actual codes since.That's probably what a lot of you all.Are interested in.Um so I'll give a quick breakdown of how.Contracts actually um exist in soron and.Then we can start trying to dig through.Some of how this how our codes actually.Tested um so for those that aren't.Familiar um The Way We have set up our.Soron repository is you'll notice that.All of the core contracts that I talked.About earlier are located within their.Own folder so for example all the code.For the back stops within the back stop.Folder pool within the pool pool Factory.Etc.Um each contract has a contract.RS file.This is really the entry point and.Interaction point for the contract so um.You'll you you'll notice that in soran.There are these macros contract contract.Client these are really the things that.Defined how users actually can call into.The contract so anything that's public.Facing um is part of this part of this.Trait and will be implemented for the.Back stop contract stru um this is also.The location where where we probably.Have all of the most user-facing.Documentation for each of the functions.So if you're ever curious about uh.What's available on a contract what the.Arguments mean um this file will be the.Place where they're documented.Um so yeah and there's also a contract.Implementation macro so this will be the.Place where a a Constructor is defined.Um so this is basically called when the.Contract's first deployed and can never.Be invoked again and there's also the.Back stop trait implementation for the.Contract and this is where all of our.Code is basically getting defined so.Everything in here is um exposed for.Anyone on the blockchain to interact.With uh the way we structured things is.We generally do all of the.Authentication that's required to um use.The use the contract here and then we.Actually perform all of the logic in a.Second helper function so that we can.Better unit test the code as a whole um.So you'll notice if you're ever looking.For authentication things um you you'll.Notice that all of the O actually takes.Place here um if you are from the evm.World o how sorbon does o is probably.One of the largest differences um.Between the two blockchains um so it is.Worth looking into it's it's incredibly.Well documented on.Sorond uh Sor bonds documentation so I.Would highly recommend uh reading.Through how that works um so you and.Then you'll also notice that for example.If I go to where we actually Define the.Logic um this is pretty common.Throughout all of our contracts so we we.We'll basically try and wrap all all of.The logic that's external to.Authentication and stuff within a.Function and we actually go through in.Write unit tests specifically for those.Functions um so this is a pretty good.Place to look if you think something uh.Might be incorrect or wrong or a bug.Exists somewhere um this is probably one.Of the easiest places to start testing.That and attempting to find um whether.Or not something's wrong and you you'll.Often find that this is like kind of.Where most of our unit tests actually.Occur um secondly one thing that we do.Include within this blend contracts.Repository is there's mock contracts and.There's also a test Suites folder um so.One thing that's really nice about.Interacting with.Soron is as I'm using tests you'll.Notice I have rust analyzer installed on.My fsco but you you you have the ability.To step through debug so if you're ever.Curious about um what actual values are.Within a function you're you can use all.The rust internal tools to step through.And actually debug it um if you're like.Most developers in the world you're just.Going to add a whole bunch of print.Lines and then run the test that also.Works fantastic too um but it's it's.Really nice for example if you do think.Something's wrong make sure to use the.Rust tools and use use all the debugging.Tools to your advantage we've been able.To find a lot of things internally um.Using those those strategies uh but one.Really important thing I wanted to touch.On especially for L contracts is we have.This giant test Suites folder um we use.A lot of this for all of the integration.Testing so for example there is a test.Fixture um this basically just contains.A whole it's it's basically going to.Deploy from a fresh environment a whole.Bunch of contracts and things that exist.To basically support a pretty standard.Blend pool um so you'll notice it's.Going to make tokens uh it adds a whole.Bunch of users uh it deploys all the.Contracts out for you and you can.Basically then start from a really good.Starting point to actually write an.Integration level test um one quick.Thing to note here is that if you ever.See an our test uh the user Bombadil um.I'm a bit of a Lord of the Rings nerd so.He is the admin and ruler of everything.So he has the power to uh basically mint.Tokens at will he's kind of the.Admin the super key for roughly all of.Our tests as well um but how this is.Actually implemented you'll actually.Notice if you look back at some of our.Older audits um we've written.Integration tests after after basically.Fixing issues that have been found um.One of these was an uh inflation attack.That I believe uh C Tor found in the.First audit um but for example this kind.Of walks you through a really good way.If you think something does exist that.Might have an issue um writing one of.These level tests is a really really.Good way to actually prove whether or.Not it exists uh since this kind of is.What at at this level of test this.Really is the place where you're going.To have the same level of interaction um.That someone using the blockchain.Would um then yeah maybe the last thing.To note before I switch over to the fev.VA here is you'll notice on the test.Test fixture when you cre the test.Picture there's a true false um just so.It's clear uh you have the ability when.Running rust integration tests to.Actually deploy the contracts and use.WMS um so if you want to use the actual.Wasm files that are being deployed um.That's great we do that in plenty of.Tests but uh if you do that um rust.Itself won't actually be able to debug.The code within the wasin packages so if.You're expecting some of the prit lines.Or um uh line by line de debugging to.Work you will need to deploy all of the.Contracts as rust crates uh that way you.Can use all the unit testing.Tools um so yeah that's probably all I'm.Going to touch on here uh again within.Test Suites and test uh this is tons of.Really good examples on setting up all.Different kinds of environments um if.You want to go through and attempt to.Prove uh that something is.Incorrect um lastly I'm going to also.Run through the Fe Vault contract um.This.Is basically a uh add-on contract that's.Aimed at wallets uh that will allow.Users to specify either a fixed rate of.Return or um excuse me a CAP rate of.Return so for example if a wallet wanted.To offer um say 10% on usdc deposits.Using blend they can deploy one of these.Fe volts uh if the blend pools returning.More than 10% they would keep that extra.Say it's returning 15% they would keep.5% 10% would go to the users um or they.Can just take a fixed interest take off.Of all of the interest generated for.Deposits through this Fe volt um so it.It works pretty similar similarly to any.Uh.Er uh ERC 4626 function or 4626 Vault.Token um so those that are familiar or.I've looked at those those kinds of.Protocols in the past um this should.Feel somewhat familiar to you um I did.Want to call out one thing you'll also.Notice some of the implementation.Patterns we use in blend also come over.Here um so the only thing that's maybe a.Bit different is this contracts a bit.Simpler so you you'll notice we've kind.Of there's probably one less layer of.Abstraction there um for you to have to.Deal with um most things are documented.Pretty well in code but if you find.Anything please please feel free to call.It out uh you'll notice that in the test.Here it's set up a bit differently so.For example um this is a very long test.But we we we mainly are testing the fee.VA through integration testing uh since.The contct is a bit similar simpler and.It relies heavily on the blend the blend.Contracts themselves so you'll notice.That we uh we support a blend rust crate.Um that includes all of the blend.Contracts themselves uh this has been.Updated for the exact hash that was.Pushed for the uh Auto competition um so.You'll notice that I.Believe yeah the version is.Here um but uh this comes with a very.Similar deployment script as the one we.Use within the blend contracts.Repository for their integration test so.Um let's see if yeah there's a blend.Flixer uh uh deploy function that will.Actually go ahead and create all of the.Blend contracts needed to interact with.Um a very similar setup as to what blend.View1 main it is um so if you do run.Into anything with the F VA um this is.Kind of a great place to look to go.Ahead and try and prove that something.INF fact is missing or has a bug.Um so yeah that's probably all I wanted.To touch on I wanted to make sure I left.A little bit of time for Sor to go.Through the formal verification portion.Of the auto competition.Um but I'll probably leave it there.Unless there's anything else you want me.To touch on Carson great uh let's uh.Let's wait and see if there's any.Questions uh at the end but uh thank you.For the presentation I'm going to invite.Shandon Armen on the.Stage welcome both of.You.Hi um Armen are you there okay yep hello.Uh you have my screen.So this is the contest.Repo um so trra you can let me know yeah.We should walk over sure uh yeah you can.Share and I'll I'll just go over it so.Um as Alex mentioned in his uh.Presentation before you know we are.Doing this audit and formal verification.Contest for blend and uh while the audit.Itself you can you know all all of the.Prog the code bases in scope uh for the.Verification part we have a smaller.Scope because um the the protocol is.There's a lot of code and so we decided.That it would be more tractable and.Manageable if we tried to focus on one.Particular part and in particular we are.Looking at the back stop crate so if you.Uh go up a little bit in this uh.Repository so for what it's worth this.Is the repository where all the code is.So you can uh clone this repository and.Then you can um.Check out all the different crates and.In particular the one that we are.Talking about is the back stop as you.Can see Armen has it here um and I want.To show the Sora specific stuff so first.Of all uh the the the properties that.You're going to be writing are going to.Be in the seras specs directory where.Armen is right now uh I think I have a.Couple of little uh so well now can you.Go maybe look at some of the other files.There's a few that I provided um just.For an example yeah so here's a few.Examples of things that you um just to.Give you an idea for what these uh look.Like um and uh so you can notice here.That uh there is this thing called cvlr.Uncore assert uh in all the rules and so.The things that are so that's one uh.Thing I want to talk about a little bit.So if you look at line number five this.Is the uh we we call it Cavalier so.Cavaliere is the specification language.That we've built um it's just a rust.Library so you can import the library.And then you can use the various.Assertions and there which are just.Macros uh that we've defined um so.Assume assert and satisfy I think are.Probably the most common ones uh and the.Ones that are I think we recommend using.Uh the most if you need something more.Specific then you can always uh reach.Out and uh we can help you figure out.How to how to do.That um the other thing uh worth noting.Here is um can you uh can Arman can you.Go down to the the cargo Tomo file at.The bottom.Uh uh yes so uh we are also relying on.Uh rust features so for example here you.Can see on line 17 there's this feature.Called.Cur and uh the nice thing about this uh.This mechanism is it actually lets you.Use this feature to selectively uh.Compile uh the code so for example um.You can if you go back Armen to uh let's.See um let's go in the back stop yeah.And maybe in the.Withdrawal uh maybe go to deposit.Actually okay perfect so if you look at.The top of this file you'll see that uh.We are using this feature called sora.And essentially what this is saying is.That when the feature is enabled and I.Just showed you before that in the cargo.TL it is enabled uh then use this mock.Implementation of the token client and.Otherwise you can use the whatever.Default one that blend was using and.This is just for verification only right.So when you're compiling your code for.Uh other purposes then you shouldn't be.Using this uh but when you're doing.Verification this is helpful because a.Lot of the times we want to modularize.Things and so you may not need to.Include all the code for the token when.You're really just verifying the code uh.For the back stop right so that's an.Interesting feature that I think you'll.Probably use uh quite a bit and you know.Always feel free to reach out uh on.Discord if you have any questions um the.Other thing I also want to highlight is.Uh the con files so on the left you will.See that there is this directory called.Conss and here we have provided some.Setup and some skeleton for some basic.Conss so let's look at the one yeah the.Withdraw one is a good one so what's.Happening here is uh we have this uh.File that has a a build script this is.Already provided you probably should not.Have to modify this at all uh it's just.A python script that uh does a bunch of.Stuff that is necessary for making sure.That the reports look nice you know you.Have all the files uploaded there it.Calls the right uh build instruction in.This case we're using this uh file.Called uh this build system called just.Um but other than you should not have to.Modify that more or less uh then there's.A few verification specific things so.For example there's this thing called we.Have this slide called uh optimistic.Loop um uh we we don't need to worry.About what that is I would leave that.There uh there's also this precise.Bitwise Ops uh flag which is set to True.Uh what this is saying is that when.You're doing the verification use bit.Vectors uh you may or may not want it uh.It's uh you can if you're facing uh like.Slow running times I recommend taking it.Out and seeing what happens and again if.You run into any issues uh when you take.It out you can reach out and we'll try.To help you.Um and then really the main thing you.Will have to modify is this rules field.So whatever rules you write uh you just.Have to add them to this file and then.You just run this uh San with this.Configuration file um I one thing I.Would recommend so it is very common for.Users to run the prover with many ruls.And that is what you will do in the end.But when you're debugging and when.You're just you know trying to test.Things out it is often helpful to just.Run one rule at a time so you know which.Rule is problematic or you know which.Has a Vu problem or all kinds of stuff.Right so um definitely keep that in mind.When you're um just getting started and.You know writing these uh as as I can.Tell you there's a lot of uh excitement.Already on Discord lots of people have.Been asking lots of questions um really.Good questions so it's already really.Nice to see the the engagement from the.The community so that's that's really.Cool uh so I think uh let me just think.What else I would like to show actually.Yes uh can you uh Armen if you click on.The documentation page that you have.Open um so yeah here we have some.Documentation for using Sunbeam so.There's the installation guide which I.Think you probably don't need to worry.Too much about if you if you if you have.Installed ctra CLI you should be you.Should be good to go so I don't think.You need anything else so the user guide.Is the main uh thing you know uh we have.Some examples of you know what the.Different components are so for example.Here um you know you see this like hash.Rule thing uh on top of these functions.So really what's Happening Here is.You're just writing rust functions right.So uh Cura is like interpreting those.Functions separately especially for.Verification but from your point of view.You're just writing rust functions with.Special macros and special annotation so.Um that's one of the annotations is this.Rule uh attribute.Um and uh I already mentioned the CVL.Assume assert macros from the Cavalier.Spec Library another thing that is very.Useful is uh this notion of.Non-determinism so uh oftentimes what.Happens is when you're doing.Verification uh you might want to uh.Sort of summarize some piece of code.Because you know maybe that's not super.Relevant for the property you're.Verifying and all you care about is that.That function returns some.Non-deterministic value right it could.Be a u64 it could be i1 128 whatever uh.It could be a user defined type all.Kinds of Stu so this nonb gives you a.Mechanism to do that so Cavalier.Actually already implements a bunch of.Non-ets for uh various primitive types.Um blend has a lot of userdefined.Structs right so for example there's the.Q4 um Q4 withdrawal uh struct uh you.Might want to implement that.Uh uh trade for this uh this truck right.So you can do it this way so right like.As there's an example here so.Essentially all you do is um you know.You assign non- debt to all the fields.Of the struct and uh you're good to go.So this is something that's really.Helpful uh for uh for verification uh we.Often have to do it and I'm imagining.Other people will have to do this as.Well we have some very basic examples in.The tutorial so we have a Sunbeam.Tutorial over um over here.Uh it gives an example of the token.Contract so if you've never done.Verification I think this is a good way.To start you can just do the exercises.Here and uh you know just try to.Understand like what what's really.Happening uh when you run the tool and.So.On um and other than that uh if you go.Back uh I think I already explained the.Scripts the build script stuff if you.Scroll down a little bit more.Armen uh yeah I think they these are.Already covered.Say so I think the main other thing I.Would recommend looking at is what.Happens when you do run Sunbeam so as I.Mentioned before and it's actually also.Uh listed in the readme for the the repo.All you do is you just run Cur San.Proofer and you pass this Con file and.You uh you run it and all you get is a.Link to a run right and this link is.Going to look something like this right.So here you can see um well so here.There is no violation so you're fine but.If there is a violation you can see a.Call Trace the call Trace is not super.Uh easy to read so if you are stuck with.Problems with the call Trace please post.Messages on Discord and we'll try to.Help you as much as possible uh you can.Also see the code right so for example.Here on the left you have this files you.Can see all the files that you used to.Run verification all the properties that.You ran all the code that you changed or.Properties you wrote everything is here.Uh so and I would always encourage you.To if you are having any problems you.Can just send me a link to a run and.Then I can take a look at the run I can.Reproduce the Run locally and and help.You debug your.Problems.Um uh other than that I'm not thinking.What else would be useful.Um I think about that's that might be.All I have like uh oh actually I I would.Like to mention one other thing.So uh we already saw uh the feature CRA.Feature of mechanism where you can.Selectively decide what functions to.Include when you're compiling we also.Saw the non-dead macro uh another thing.That you may have to do is uh summarize.Various functions so this is something.That you know for example here uh the.Way the best way to do this is the.Following right so uh in the C specs.Directory you there is a directory.Called summaries and in there you can uh.So the mod is that's where you um just.Expose all the summaries that you have.Written so here there's you know this.File called emissions and in emissions.It's possible that depending on the.Property you're proving you might have.To summarize right so for example you.Can say that I don't really care what.Emissions does as long as it's returning.A Nonet terministic value or you can.That well it should be a.Nondeterministic value but maybe it.Should be in some range so this kind of.Stuff right like it really depends on.Your understanding of protocol and like.What you think is necessary for um.Whoever is calling this function to know.About this function Behavior right so.This is actually often very helpful so.You can put all your summaries here and.Then wherever you're calling the.Function instead of calling the original.Function you just call this function and.Um it would be really good if you.Actually annotate it with this because.Then you know you're not really changing.The semantics of the original program.Um great I think we need to wrap it up.Here but uh thank you so much for for.This presentation uh I think this was uh.Very helpful for everyone who's going to.Participate in the in the competition to.Get to walk through both of the code and.And and uh and the verification here so.Thank you all for joining um I didn't.See any questions in the chat but yeah.Feel free to reach out um also in.Discord if there's anything I'll post.The link again in Discord for the.Competition so good luck to everyone uh.The competition is running until March.17th so still have plenty of time to to.Dig into it thank you everyone for.Joining thank you Shandra and Alex for.For joining here us thank you everyone.Thanks everybody.
