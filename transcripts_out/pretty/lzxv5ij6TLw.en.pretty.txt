Hello everyone welcome to this week's.Protocol meeting uh we have a couple.Caps to discuss today uh and I'll start.By presenting cap.67 I'll share the link.Here so uh this CAP is about emitting.Events in Stellar in the same format.That we see in sorine for Stellar assets.So that a user can use the stream of.Events track.Balances and this CAP covers three.Separate High higher level changes uh.They're listed in the abstract of the.Cap and I'll first go over the uh the.Two smaller changes that make some.Semantic fixes to the seller asset.Contract events for compatibility with.Set 41 which is the token interface.Set uh so the first is that we're going.To stop emitting uh the admin uh the.Admin on the mint and clawback events uh.The admin is an implementation detail of.The.Sa uh and does not belong in the event.The admin doesn't even exist in sub 41.As a concept.Uh the second change is that we're going.To update an edge case with regards to.Transfers to and from an issuer uh the.Sa was written in a way that matched.Classic payment semantics uh where a.Transfer from an issuer Min the asset.And a transfer to an issuer burns the.Asset the issue is that in these two.Scenarios we still emit a transfer event.Instead of the appropriate Mint or burn.Event uh so this CAP just proposes.Fixing that to Mint the the mint the.Correct Mint or burn event instead of.The transfer.Prevent uh so I'll pause there real.Quick if there are any questions about.Those two changes before I move on to.The uh the bigger change at.Hand all right then I'll move on to the.Third and most significant change of.This CAP which is emitting an event in.The same format as the Stellar asset.Contract for any asset.Movement um and this means that a a.Stellar operation that results in the.Movement of an asset can emit.Uh a transfer mint burn or clawback.Event uh and we're also adding a fee.Event to represent the fee paid by by.The Source count so the the cap.Specifies what what the uh events for.Each operation will look like but I'll.Just mention some interesting points so.A trade that occurs through either.Through an offer operation or path.Payment operation will result in two.Events one for each side of the trade uh.And the two parties on both events will.Be the source account of the operation.And the owner of the.Offer uh and it's and these these events.Can be transfer events but they can also.Be instead be a mint or burn if the.Issuer is.Involved we're also adding uh new SD.Address types to be able to represent.The claimable balances and liquidity.Pools as from or two addresses in these.Events and this allows us to represent.Movements to and from these entries.Yeah so uh silence asked uh can you.Explain removing the admin from the sa.Mint and Clack events So currently on.The mint and Clack events of the sa not.Not in set.41 uh the admin is uh one of is is one.Of the topics of the event but this is.Uh this isn't necessary and the concept.Of an admin is not required for uh a.Token exactly yeah it's not it's not.We're not removing the admin from the sa.Uh just it just says the topic we're.Removing it from the the topic of the.Event all right uh so yeah we're also in.Addition to those two new address types.Uh for clal balances and liquidity pools.We're also adding another SC address.Type for MX accounts so that these new.Events can pass along the MX information.That the MX account is used in the.Operation or.Transaction uh it's also another thing.To.Sh.Screens so I'm I'm actually not.Presenting this in the order that it uh.Like it shows up in the CAP this is just.Uh some points I thought were.Interesting but if you look at cap.67 uh these points should be listed.There at a at a with more.Detail uh then yeah so yeah so I wanted.To mention that these new events will.Not be Into The Ledger therefore will.Not be part of the protocol and uh we.Also will emit the emit these events.From Genesis if you replay from Genesis.And something to keep in mind here is.That there was a bug in a very old.Protocol version where xlm was minted.And burned uh and we will admit events.Uh that will allow you to reconcile.Those Balan.Changes and finally we will be reworking.The format of TX meta with the.Transaction meta V4 that generalizes the.Events and separates them by operation.Previously the events were for uh.Formatted in a way where was very.Specific to sorban and the fact that.Sorban only has for a single sbon.Transaction there's only one operation.But the transaction meta V4 generalizes.That and the plan is to provide a config.Flag that enables the emission of this.New uh meta.Format uh okay so let me look at some of.These questions.So will this resolve the issue with a.Locked issuer sa having an admin Sil can.Do things the issuer.Lock no so I think what you're sounds I.Think what you're asking is if you.Change the admin uh and you lock the.Issuer the ad okay ignore that yeah they.The admin can still do whatever it wants.Uh what else does back filling mean that.Replaying with these new events enabled.Will emit meta4 for all ledgers rather.Than just post 23 yeah that is the goal.Uh and we and that should work I we we.Probably have some stuff to work through.There but if we want to admit these.Events from uh the beginning then it has.To be meta V4.So MX addresses and memo so yeah one one.Of the issues is so the CAP addresses.The M uh partially by forwarding the M.Addresses into the events but there is.Uh another question about.Memos uh that I'll link this discussion.Topic.[Music].From from.Nico it's.Relevant and at a high.Level uh this this amounts to.Considering a solution where you can.Group uh an arbitrary memo with a with a.Group of trans uh events this will allow.You to you know solve some issues we've.Had with uh in the past with regards to.The design of memos um but that uh but.Yeah I don't know if Lee if you want to.Discuss this a little bit more that's.Something this concept is something we.Still have to.Discuss yeah good um yeah so yeah NCO.May want to he he this is sort of I feel.Like his idea so he may want.To speak to this as well um but there.You know we have the separate we have.Another CAP CAP 64 that we're not.Actually discussing today um that's.Um doing some things with MOS it's.Touching MOS and where they show up.Where they will show up in.Tooling uh and uh you know making it.Possible.To do a soran transaction.Um with a memo and have that safely.Included in the signature so that's cap.64 and something that niik was bringing.Up with this CAP is that you know right.Now we're in this moment where we're.Making some significant changes to.Events or we're doing a lot of work.Around events and doesn't make sense you.Know we have to sort of um we we sort of.Have to get close to Memos because we've.Got this issue with moer dresses and you.Know right now cup.67 um.In a very non-controversial way is just.Suggesting that these events now might.Contain addresses that are MX addresses.So we're just going to pass it through.So if you do a payment.Operation um that's got a destination of.A Max address uh that address field in.The San event could be a MX address it.Could be an M address instead of a g.Address or a c address and I I think.That is like very not noncontroversial.Um it's sort of like straight line what.We I guess we would sort of expect the.Cap to do in the situation um but there.Is this we have this history where you.Know once upon a time there was memos.Then there were M addresses um right now.The ecosystem is pretty um there's you.Know both get used in the ecosystem so.Both getting used by.Exchanges um and but when you look at.The data the data tells a somewhat.Confusing story because this is memo.Field there's this MOX address they can.Be in the destination you know.Technically sources can also be.Addresses um and nik's Nik was sort of.Suggest I don't know if I don't know if.This was actually a proposal but he was.Suggesting like do we do something more.Here do we do we make these events in.This moment more opinionated about what.The memo for this event is um and you.Know do we do something like if there's.A transaction memo this event has a memo.Um is or if there's a destination of a m.Address do we pull the memo out of the.Address and we say well actually that's.The memo for this.Event to some degree like the ecosystem.Has to do this somewhere and you know.Right now it has to do this Downstream.Ecosystem tooling uh has to make a.Decision about where these events come.From um and in the future uh like you.Know right now memo memos there's like.MX addresses are only a classic thing.Memos only occur at the transaction.Level um in CAP 64 but.In the future uh like how do you attach.Memos to like other groupings or.Transfers if there's you know transfers.Being bundled together um yeah sorry I'm.Not sure I'm actually doing a great job.Of summarizing this there's like a lot.Um.Yeah yeah it's definitely uh something.That still needs to be thought through.But I guess the question is uh should we.Explore yeah addressing that issue in.Cap 67 it sounds like we should at least.At a high level I think I think we.Should and I think what nio just posted.In the in the chat is a really succinct.Way of for the why we should consider it.Now and that is that you know CAP 64 is.Forcing the memo to be exposed in down.TR systems for San events and so it.Makes sense since this CAP is very.Focused on that consistency between.Classic and sorban and fixing it across.Those two dimensions of you know San.Versus classic sack versus set 41 um it.Makes sense to discuss.Now yeah makes sense okay orbit asked.This question uh why did we decide to.Extend the meta with the vents if these.Events can be commuted dynamically from.The existing meta seems like redundant.Data in the meta and this is something.We actually.Discussed uh internally I believe George.Actually mentioned the same single.Source of Tru truth rather than risking.Bugs Downstream renting the wheel and.Dynamic compute also Lee do you have I.Say you mut yourself do you want to.Address this yeah I can I can speak to.This um the a large part of this is that.You know when we look at um the tooling.That we have today so we have a horizon.Which takes a lot of What's um in the.Mattera today and creates this data.Model for people to consume um this new.Data model for people consume and then.St RPC was designed um with a different.Approach where the Stellar IPC really.Exposes the raw network data um and.Tries to introduce as little as possible.In terms of its own data model on top of.That and one of the reasons that Stell.IPC was designed that way is that um you.Can go to uh you know you can take.Contract events that have come out of.Star RPC and they look the same way as.If you go and take meta out of core or.If you use G Galaxy um to you know.Generate a data Lake of meta like the.Events look the same way in all these.Different places except if you go to.Horizon you know Horizon has its own.Data model and it has that effects data.Model um which.Is you know very different so um the.Idea between the ibr like how like why.Bring these events to Classic and the.The the Stellar asset contract and the.CL operations is to create this like one.Unified view that appears everywhere.That um looks the same everywhere that.That the data.Occurs okay I hopefully that answers.That question but if not let us.Know um I think Lee you mentioned.Another thing about uh another question.About asset names on the on the the.Topic of the events right uh because the.Currently go ahead maybe before we move.On it does sound like orbit has some.Things I'm Orit do you want to um do you.Want to speak.To yeah hello everyone um just wanted to.Add my two Sense on this uh we've been.Successfully reconstructing everything.From uh uh transaction meta xdr on the.Client side.Basically our inje pipeline in Stell.Expert is built on top of the.Library um that we built uh specifically.For this purpose um and we had a.Conversation with the Horizon team.Before like several years ago I think uh.Where I proposed to.Actually remove all this excessive data.Tables like uh effects and everything.Like this because uh all of it can be.Reconstructed on the client.Side of course uh there are very.Specific um issues uh like uh the memo.Case lay covered before that.Uh um but maybe we can just.Um like conduct some research on it and.Uh.Maybe the Parson Library we already have.And which have been tested uh for years.And which works with classic and.San uh maybe it's enough because on the.Client side people can just use it.Directly in JavaScript to parse the.Response they receive from.DC.Um Horizon now doesn't support.Transaction meta so it's.Probably case when we cannot use it.Directly but uh at least from RPC it has.Uh zero problems is.Parson looks like George has something.To say but I can't bring him up on.Stage there oh okay yeah I I actually.Didn't have anything to say uh I think.It's a I think or makes a good point um.But I do think that a unified event.Stream um is better for uh like your.Average dap developer um even though we.Can do all the indexing on the Fly it's.Probably more catered towards like.Infrastructure uh providers like Stellar.Expert and.Horizon so this is still going to have.Value for people who are just.Interacting with RPC.Directly I mean we've been using it to.Actually display transactions uh in.Sellar.Expert be wallet uh uh reflector.Refractor.Everywhere uh I'd say it's a universal.Approach that can be used everywhere I'm.Not insisting on it it just seems to me.That um transaction meta will be even.Larger after that.And it might have some uh duplicated.Data because of uh of this.Can you hear me.Well yeah I can hear you yeah okay great.Um so I I have a couple thoughts on this.Uh first uh if the meta size increase is.Concerned I think I don't know if we.Made it explicit anywhere but I think.This should be optional for the most.Part.Um at least I don't see a good reason.For not making Z.Um so I I don't think and the same goes.Actually for The Ledger changes um.Ideally you would be able to pick one or.Another depending on what is your.Downstream.Processing whatever suits you um then.Regarding the library I wanted to point.Out that well a not wa JavaScript is not.The only language out there but uh also.There is like some Nuance to like there.Is very Nuance difference between Ledger.Divs and events because events tell you.What exactly has happened during the.Transaction whereas weder deeps tell you.What was the state after the transaction.And uh I think it matters more for soran.But I don't know it might have some.Interesting implications for classic I.Don't know if they're interesting to.Anyone but.Um just that the format of the event.Like if you're processing Samson you.Might be interested in processing Samson.As a stream of specifically events right.And not a stream of um some data types.That depend on the operations like can.See from the library correct me if only.Them missing something there but this.Don't seem to me like this stand and the.Idea here is that you know if I wanted.To track just the movement of the.Balance and I not particularly.Interested in the exact semantics of.Each and every store operation what I.Could do is I could just ingest the.Event stream and track the balance um.For a given.Account um which I think may be.Interesting to some consumers um so yeah.This are just some thoughts on what why.Buer doing this at.All I think uh the argument regarding.The event stream is pretty solid because.Uh this way uh the server in this case.RPC handles uh the streaming itself and.Uh uh indexing and cses and Etc so.Instead of working with transactions and.Parson transactions uh it can like.Really rely on these events it's a solid.Argument uh it point is that um I'm not.Proposing to use JavaScript everywhere.Maybe um we.Can like Port this uh to rust uh or.Other languages and um use it inside RPC.Inside uh other applications uh instead.Of uh adding the data we can like uh do.It uh on the fly in RPC itself right uh.Regenerate this events uh because.Basically all described events that what.We do with.U with the transaction.M xdr uh that's something we already.Do so maybe it's just uh one of the.Options uh instead of extending uh.The xdr itself.Again because uh to me it looks already.Pretty.Large my subjective opinion on.This but again if you could opt out of.Imian events would that solve your issue.With the size because it's I think.Besides the size concern I feel like the.Suggestion of let's put Comm.Implementation somewhere we just.Suggesting well why don't we put this.Common implementation right into ore I.Don't think it makes a huge ideological.Difference and I think it does make.Something easier to maintain and to.Ensure that they works correctly for b.Um yeah especially if we are doing.Protocal changes um so yeah and just for.The say I totally agree and.Yeah so I don't know if you have any.Strong arguments but I feel like you're.More or less in the same page here in.Terms of standardization because it I.Guess just in of putting it into cor.Kind of make.Sense yeah the standardization it sits.Inside The Narrative of everything being.A contract so I think like that's what's.Beautiful about this is that um you know.Today we have you know classic.Operations and then we have everything.That happens on sorban um and the result.Of those things looks pretty different.But as a result of this work we're.Moving towards this future where.Actually everything that just happens on.Classic looks exactly like a contract.That's executing and you know all assets.Actually do have a contract that's.Reserved for them they have the Stellar.Asset.Contract and so the events are just.Going to look like everything that.Happens with assets no matter if it's.Classic or anything like that it just.Looks like a contract um which is also.Much more similar to other ecosystems uh.Other like blockchain ecosystems as well.So um there's that familiarity for.Everybody about how this works versus.Say ethereum and other.Things yeah and I I I'll make sure to.Clarify in the uh the CAP that nothing's.Being removed from meta and this will be.Optional that's a good point.I mentioned the config flag for.Transaction met V4 but I I'll go into.That in a little more detail um are.There any other.Questions I didn't quite catch if we.Have made any final decision on.MOS uh like what we talked about like 10.Minutes ago.Wa wait what is the final stages because.I maybe I've lost it yeah so we're for.In the context of this CAP we are the.We're forwarding the M account.Information right into the the addresses.But for memos we still need to explore.Uh what Nico mentioned earlier like so.There's nothing finalized there but we.But we are going to go look into that.Right soal decision okay I was just kind.Of missed it okay yeah.No yeah I'm not I'm not sure if we want.To discuss that more because it's not.Actually nobody's actually written like.A a formal this is how we're how we.Would propose an alternative for it to.Work I mean I could say something right.Now that I.Think uh I think aligns with what niik.Was talking about but I don't know if.I I think it'd be valuable if we.Actually uh get something written down.Then present it in the future meeting.Because I know we uh we have 30 minutes.Left and dimma has a couple caps to.Present that's probably more valuable.Right.Great all right um go ahead okay yeah.Great uh yeah I don't actually mind.Spending more time on the events if.Necessary but uh if you're done uh we.Can go.App uh.Uh that's six hisory um.So this is basically a CAP that uh.Mostly changes the transaction set um.But it does so in a pretty interesting.Way um so as you may or may not know uh.Al a hustle you need to go through with.A Footprints uh inur transaction is done.For a good reason and this reason is uh.Being able to run the transactions in.Parallel because if you know your.Footprint we know that you don't have a.Data dependency between two.Transactions and you actually can run.Them in parallel without worrying about.Any.Synchronization um so given the.Footprints in theory today what you.Could do is you could right your own.Version of core uh application logic.That takes the transactions and.Partitions them somehow into threads.That R par from each other um but the.Issue with that is that uh there is no.Good boundary on how much time is it.Supposed to take for example if you take.10 transactions without data.Dependencies you could run them in 10.Shads and they would for example take 10.Milliseconds um after synchronization or.You could have the same 10 transactions.But all of them dependent on some W your.Entries are being updated and thus you.Cannot schedule them into 10 different.Threads you would run them in the single.Thread fres and in the end you will.Spend not 10 milliseconds but 100.Milliseconds to apply all.Transactions um so basically there is.Since protocol doesn't do anything.Currently about.Pration um there is no good way to.Schedule the transactions in such a way.That it takes uh some bounded and.Expected well well there is still an.Upper bound on the runtime but this.Upper bound rise wildly and um it's not.Good if Ledger May close both within 100.Mills or within like two seconds for.Example uh which is why um we are doing.This CAP fix3 which solves exactly that.Problem which is uh given um a set of.Transactions come up with a transaction.Set data structure um that guarantees uh.Certain time for appliances.Transactions um is a c of course of that.Time being time in model constructions.And not of course well time CL time.Because we um kind of cannot tell it.Beforehand without tring the contracts.But we hope that our cost models are.Good enough and another cave being that.Uh you actually should have the fish is.Sufficient amount of physical course to.Support multi stading because well again.If you have just one core obviously it.Doesn't matter if you run 10 shreds um.There some.Here um so uh if you have just a single.Core and you wanted to apply.Transactions in 10 threats obviously.You'll not get any performance gain.Because well transactions are purely CPU.Bound.Um so that's the motivation uh for this.Cap and the way it.Works is uh that we Define a new.Structure for the transaction set that.Instead of having a linear array of.Transactions um defines uh two levels of.Group transactions together and the.First level is called.Stages um and I will talk about why.Stages and what does it need for any.Moment and then every stage uh consists.Of multiple clusters of transactions and.Within the cluster transactions.Generally may have data dependencies so.It is expect Ed in this cluster to have.Data dependent transactions that need to.Run.Sequentially however there are no uh.Data dependencies between the Clusters.Themselves um and thus since every.Cluster is guaranteed to be um.Independent of every as cluster what you.Could do is you could take every cluster.And put it into a separate physical.Thread and uh thus you can apply the.Whole stage uh in parall is as many.Threats as you have.Rers.Um also I probably forgot to clarify.What we consider data dependency it is.When a single transaction has an entry.In a retrade footprint and then another.Transaction has the same entry in either.Readon or retrade footprint me that one.Transaction modifies the entry another.Transaction as read so modifies it in.Either case we need to sequence them.Because um if you don't do that then we.Will get non deterministic results for.Any these.Transactions now.Um why do we have this additional uh.Level of uh transaction grouping in.Stages um the reason is that um if uh we.Just try to naively say hey let's just.Par the put the transactions in separate.Threads uh put them transaction set and.That's it then um you may run into some.Issues with um C traffic patterns for.Example.Imagine uh an oracle contract for.Example right and imagine it updates and.Entry some key and then there are bunch.Of transactions that want to read the.Value from the contract from the ccal.Contract and that key um and thus we.Have uh data dependency on a single.Entry um but we have only a single rate.Of the entry but we have a lot of rats.Of the exact same entry um so what we.Can do with this stages is that you can.Put right into one stage and then all.Reads into different.Stages.And basically this introduces just a few.Barriers of execution into the.Transaction execution schedule um but it.Allows kind of efficiently work around.This traffic patterns and um um given.Smart enough maybe not even smart enough.Uh algra for actually coming up with.This data structure uh you can deal with.A surprising amount of conflicts all at.Once without introducing any special uh.Scheduling and synchronization procedure.So basically just have a few barriers um.In between the transaction applications.And this allows resolving a lot of the.Conflicts at the same time um before.Driving deeper I go read that for a.Moment and there any questions far.Um uh okay uh the new adjust approach.Okay so this uh app itself just changes.The structure of the transaction sets it.Doesn't have any particular changes.Around how we uh which transactions do.We pick at.All but uh what I can say that the.Protocol specification remains such that.Uh that transaction ification order is.Randomized and I think in case of uh M.Manipulations um nothing changes from.The current approach because uh for any.Arbitrage you're probably going to have.The data dependency and data dependent.Transactions are applied sequentially.And uh all we shuffle all the stuff that.Is being applied sequentially so the.Transaction order is still uh for to.Predict and uh yeah I don't think it's.Any easier to manipulate than it is.Currently which is to say it's not.Impossible but just spaming Ledger is a.Arbitr transaction for.Um yeah uh in terms of the system.Requirements again the cup doesn't.Define them uh I will will talk about.This in a moment uh but uh of course yes.If we want to run transactions in.Parallel then well you need to have uh.Certain number of course present uh on.The validator which is I guess a.Tradeoff with the um like that's.Horizontal scaling the notot use better.Hardware as then cannot find more.Transaction.Um uh M resarch maybe maybe I think I.Already have the section on shoing the.Transactions so may be efficient maybe.Not um.Yeah uh okay I see question regarding Z.And uh let me actually go a bit deeper.Regarding how exactly things are.Specified first thing is that uh.Moro uh does introduce a new network.Configuration setting for the maximum.Number of f per stage which roughly well.Not roughly but basically maps to the.EXP Ed number of course uh uh that your.That the network is willing to throw it.When ledgers if you have less course.Then uh it may take for you longer uh.Than expected to pric transactions you.Have more cores uh or at least that many.You should be good and uh as all the.Network configuration settings uh this.Setting uh will be uh Modified by.Validator vot so you know some.Validators say that we don't have that.Many cores um they will not vote for.This and uh ultimately Network can.Decide if requirements for to rers are.Too expensive or uh too hard to come.This come up this and uh also to make it.Clear when we upgrade to protocal 23.This setting will be set to just one so.Um any parallelism allowed as network.Settings so you know that to enable any.Parallelism uh Network quote to.Happen Okay um.Then to the structure okay I already.Talked through the specification of the.Uh data structure.The phas fee and search pricing will.Work in the same way as it works now.Which is there will be a single base fee.For the.Transactions it is 100 Stoops uh if.There is no search price in and if there.Is SAR pricing which means like if there.Were transactions that you couldn't.Include in The Ledger but this that were.In the mle uh we take the fee of the.Cheapest transaction that we do include.And use it as a base fees that everyone.Has to.Pay.Um okay and now again to the apply order.Um first uh there is still a canonical.Apply order uh that is defined in CAP so.You still can apply all the transactions.Sequentially and arrive at the same.Result as you would if you were uh if.You applying them in.Parallel and uh similar to what we do.Now uh we Shuffle the things before.Applying them um first we Shuffle every.Cluster um using the hash of the.Transaction set and hash of every.Transaction then the uh for the Clusters.We don't need to shuffle them but.By the transaction.Hashes and then we Shuffle the stages as.Well so yeah like so transactions are um.In different stages um one may happen.Before or after another.One.Um that's kind of what to do for Shing.And I think it's not significantly.Different from our St.Um yeah I don't think uh it does.Anything specific.To again it doesn't changes status quo.For M um on the large scale like I think.The best thing you can do is still just.Spam the network is heritor transactions.It is the issue we have now and uh it.Persists like the goal of this CAP is.Not to prevent uh these types of attacks.Uh but it does not make it any easier to.Guarantee any particular execution order.Between two.Transactions um so yeah I don't see like.If you see something specific like maybe.You know maybe we can up Asing later uh.But I yeah I don't think there is any.Change to to the execution orders that.Is relevant.For.Um right um okay so that's a kind of.Simpler part of the CAP so again um.Multiple threads to apply transactions.In parallel oh uh the most important.Thing that I forgot to mention is that.We limit the number of sequential.Instructions across all the stages which.Means that for every stage we look at.The cluster that takes the longest time.In terms of model instructions and then.We sum up this numbers across all the.Stages and then we come up with some.Number of sequential modeled.Instructions which are hopefully.Approximating the real runtime for.Applian the transaction set given and.Physical threats for example um if the.Ledger limit currently is 500 milon.Instructions um with uh this CAP for.Example if you set Ledger Max dependent.TX clusters to for example eight meaning.You need eight physical threads and we.Keep the limited 500 million.Instructions we expect the weder.Application time be roughly a factor of.500 million virtual instructions which.We still on to few hundred milliseconds.Currently um our cost.Models.Um yeah so that's kind of the simpler.Part of the CAP um the trickiest thing.Is the GTL update semantic change.Um so all this data dependency stuff is.Very good and nice but um one thing that.We again consciously did uh when La in.San is um we allow extending the dtl of.The entries uh even if the entries are.In read only footprint and the reason.For that is that well we expect TTL.Updates to be really.Prevalent and uh if we treated them as.Rights uh there is a big chance we.Wouldn't be able to AR anything at all.Because things would be just just uh.Clump together with all this clusters of.For us contract that happen to update.Totl on the same.Entes um which is why we decided that we.Actually can um reconcile the r changes.Um after running all the transactions.Without risking um introducing any.Nondeterminism and this TTL updates.Someand exchange is uh doing exactly.That uh uh changes how we update ttls in.Such a way that uh changes to TTL uh.Done by transactions that only touch the.Readon entries uh are not observable.Until uh someone actually writes the.Entry or until we have finished applying.All the.Transactions um which is good enough to.Be able to actually run all the.Transactions that have the same ke only.The run them in parallel and still right.Have the proper TTL.Value and the algorithm proposed is uh.Pretty leny but the gist of it is that.Um if uh two transactions uh update to.TL on the same.Entry um they both will see the initial.State of the TTL of the.Tantry and uh will be charged the.Respective fee for set so for example if.Transaction a has a key in with only.Footprint and updates TL of some say xlm.Contract rate uh by 200 ledgers.Increases TTL by 200 ledgers and then.Transaction B increases TTL of exm.Contract by 100 ledgers uh well the.Transaction a will pay for extension by.200 ledgers and transaction B will pay.For the D extension by 100 Ledges but.What we will do in background is we will.Correct this TTL changes and only apply.The maximum change out of that to the.Ler out of this two to the ler which.Means that the uh exm contract will be.In the end extended by 200.Lers and it does introduce uh bit of.Annoyance into how uh mattera should be.Processed which is unfortunate but um I.Couldn't think of a way that is both.Compatible with prism and doesn't.Require any changes in met ingestion and.Uh this change is.That uh basically when ingesting the.Changes in TLS from the mattera you.Should never decrease TT.Um this is only thing you need to do um.It is documented in the CAP and you'll.Probably make another announcement um.But uh yeah we kind of get around doing.Something special for the map and this.Seems like the minimum possible change.So TTL like that you record in the back.End and never go down but the TTL That.You observe in the.Is correct DET change for the mattera is.Correct in the context of a given.Transaction meaning as I mentioned.Before uh that will charge the fee um.Based on the changes that you observe in.Meta.Um and this is kind of the ju of it and.U right.Uh yeah I can talk a little bit about.Candid generation and then move on to.Question um caps don't typically provide.A way of how to actually build a.Transaction sets uh which makes sense it.Doesn't need to be a part of the.Protocol as long as it is valid it.Doesn't matter how it has been built um.But will'll likely implement the simple.Gitty algorithm uh described in the cap.And the idea behind it is just to pack.The transactions into the stages.R um while uring uh we are utilizing the.Stes uh properly by being packing from.Time to time and the efficiency of being.Packing heris sixs is surprisingly um.Good so in the end I think we can I.Added some benchmarks and uh we can both.P the leeders pretty efficiently like.Uze most of the instructions and we can.Also deal with a decent amount of.Conflicts like if you have some.Relatively sparse clusters of conflicts.Uh that will not cause any depredation.In lure utilization at all and in order.To have any real degradation un need.Like some super inter interdependent.Transaction for which I don't expect to.Be uh happening in the wild um so I.Think this should be good enough at.Least uh initially and uh if we ever.Observe there are issues with that um.Ways to deal with that both at the mle.Level and the U wayer of building the.Transaction sets.Um I think that's all I wanted to talk.About just to present the CAP and uh now.I will most through the chat and read.Some questions.Um yeah uh question from niik about the.Meta changes for.TTL.Um M net diffs for.Ttls not emit one per.Transaction well um we still need to.Emit TT per transaction I think because.They are an effect of the transaction.This is how we charge P um and I I'm not.Sure it is correct to just omit.Them and.Um whether we want to update meta I have.Considered this I I'm not sure it is.Necessarily a better solution so.Basically the alternative to what is.Proposed in this app is um well we could.Add yet another field to the mattera.That will explicitly output the.TTL every entry facted by the wer the.Final for it after applying every.Transaction in The Ledger.Um I like that's potentially a.Significant amount of duplication unless.We also kind of remove the changes for.Transaction I'm not sure if it is a good.Idea to remove the changes per.Transaction because then well meta just.Has some entries drop that transaction.Has actually affected which makes tricky.To debu transactions for example makes.To understand your fees if you ever.Wanted to run uh the computation logic.Comp so I'm sure we can omit that Pro.Transaction changes but then I'm not.Sure if duplicating this data is.Necessarily making things much easier to.Just not decrease in TTL with your track.On.It.Um so that's my opinion um.And I I mean you either need special.Logic for merges or you need special.Logic.For this new types of TT entries and you.Also need to kind of sometimes ignore.That for transaction changes um I'm.Honestly not convinced if it is a good.Idea and if you wanted it possible to.Only ingest the T changes after the LED.Then so that you don't even need to.Process per transaction changes at all.Then basically we duplicate every TTL.Change into which is again probably not.Very Fe you don't know n if you want.To talk more about this.Um okay I don't see any more questions.Uh and we actually have just three.Minutes left so um if anyone has any.Questions uh please feel free to comment.On the ad discussions read it is uh yeah.I guess the to meta change is really the.Most controversial thing about it.Everything else.Is really uncontroversial I feel because.Though we are just allowing to include.More transactions in Ledger and we still.Shuffle them so no changes for any um so.Yeah yeah and one final thing I'll say.Thanks thanks for presenting Dima uh.We we forgot to talk about back to the.Unified events a one topic about how the.Sa events have the asset name of the.Topics but SE 41 doesn't specify uh.Having putting the asset name in the.Topic so uh lee is about to start a.Thread about this so we can discuss it.There um yeah yeah Le just posted the uh.Thread in the chat uh yeah that's all.That's all we have for today thank you.For joining.
