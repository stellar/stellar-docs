Welcome everyone to this week's Stellar.Developer meeting today I have a very.Busy guest who fortunately made the the.Time to to come here today it's uh Andre.From uh ramp me Daddy and I'm going to.Let him on the stage as.Well hello Andre hi garon thanks thanks.For having me great to be here hi.Everyone yeah great to have you here.You've been very busy uh I Met You in.San Francisco on Monday and it seems.Like uh um a lot of things are going on.But can you maybe just start by.Introducing yourself and your team and.And what you're working on yeah yeah.Absolutely happy to uh my name is Andre.I'm the co-founder CEO of rant Maddy uh.Rant M Daddy was born at at a consensus.Hackathon hosted by EA guys amazing.Amazing time amazing it's it was a lot.Of fun uh and and we rode that uh wave.Of fun for the past whatever seven.Months at this point that has turned.Into a real company that's uh seeing.Real traction we're getting a lot of.Positive feedback um we so R me Daddy.Right now is a telegram digital wallet.Uh designed for Global Payments and for.Mcoin trading uh mcoins have been uh.Super hot and um on on you know on uh.And and more more chains are picking it.Up so we're super excited about that.Ultimately the goal is to be uh.Multi-chain uh wallet for for mem coins.But when it comes to payments uh I mean.That's that's something that we started.Uh rent.Maddy at the core of sending Global.Payments and we want to make it as easy.As sending a text message and Stellar.Has been extremely helpful with that.Great so so how far along are you in the.Process I know you've been working hard.On it for for quite some time but what.Is the status today how how far along.Are you yeah no uh it's so today.Actually this call I'm doing out of uh.The Draper.University um building facility uh we.Are just wrapping up our Draper.University um accelerator so we did a.Three-week pre accelerator back in.August uh that was amazing time very had.A had a very impact on what we're.Building um got to meet a lot of amazing.Uh people well actually I think that's.That's when uh we met for the first time.Uh and actually got to work together uh.We but we were also able to meet denell.We were able to pitch to Tim Draper we.Were able to accomplish a lot of things.In just three weeks um after that I.Think we you know we we showed our.Strength we got uh people interested in.What we're building and uh Draper.University and Stell invited us back to.The official accelerator that's not 3.Weeks it's 12 weeks and um we have been.Just crushing it here with with with.With a team of 10 other companies um.Building Innovative products um and the.Idea the reason that we decided to go.With telegram in the first place is.Because telegram has a billion users.Worldwide and um a lot of these users.Are in U you know there's a lot in.United States but there there there's.Users from everywhere in the world I.Think there's a number of groups where.That I'm an active participant in with.People from I think we we did some.Calculations and it's about 40 countries.So I think it's amazing that you know.Telegram brings it all together and uh.We figured well let's let's see how we.Can facilitate payments inside that and.Um but before but before we get into.Payments obviously we need to be able to.On-ramp uh onchain so at the hackathon.We buildt the on- ramping solution and.Um we kind of have iterated a number of.Uh I don't want to say pivot because.Pivot usually to me see sounds like it.You were doing something now you're.Doing something else I think we just re.Refined and reiterated in our idea to to.Hit both I mean I it's uh to hit both.Functionality and revenue uh and those.Are two.Important pieces of any business and I.Think we uh I think we're finally at a.Point where they're they're put together.And it it makes.Sense okay uh we were trying to get uh.To get a screen share going did you get.It to work yeah let's uh I I think so uh.It would be fun to see see it in action.Yeah so I guess let me start with um the.So rent me Daddy uh is a telegram wallet.That we're still building uh I I would.Say uh I think our CTO will uh be not.Super happy with me but uh I I'll say.Maybe four to six weeks is left uh.But so so we're going to roll it out but.I think there's a big strategy to how.You roll things out uh because you can.Spend all of this time um and then roll.Out a product and then start driving.Traffic to that product um when it's.Live we decided to take a different.Approach we decided to roll out a teaser.Game inside telegram uh it's a very.Simple game uh you just guess if the.Bitcoin price is going to go up or down.You tap on it and then 5 seconds later.It tells you if you're uh if you won or.Lost if you won you get 10 points if you.Lost you get Five Points deducted so.That's uh that's the game in a nutshell.We have been seeing a lot of traction a.Lot of positive feedback on that game uh.And uh it's amazing to see how just.Walking around Draper University I would.Be passing by someone and I see someone.Sitting on the couch tapping playing the.Game so that's uh that's the idea we.Were able to secure a couple of.Partnerships with other telegram games.That have uh communities of millions of.People I think between the all of the.Partners that we have right now there's.50 million people in the community for.Those games and we have a very strategic.Partnership where um they will drive.Traffic to our game and uh that will.That will engage players with our game.And we get to tap into the $50 million.Community sorry 50 million people.Community in those games so um that's.And then after the players are happy and.They're excited with with a game they're.Familiar with a brand then we'll start.Promoting the wallet to the to these.Clients and uh kind of it's it we expect.It to be a much simpler conversion to to.Get people to use the wallet uh so it's.There's a strategy for the game it might.Seem like okay well what what does the.Game have to do with that but we put a.Lot of thought into it and did a lot of.Research and the client feedback to.Before we built it so uh but yeah happy.To share I just wanted to give some.Background so people are not confused.About uh what's going on here um so let.Me try to share my telegram window so if.You go to are you able to sh see my.Telegram window yeah awesome.So uh let's see so if you go at rentme.Daddy bot uh and you type type this in.Rentme daddy bot um you can click Start.And you can hit launch um we launch the.Game and are you able to see the.Game uh no I don't see the game oh man.It's probably because it's a window.That's shared not the screen yeah let.Me okay let me let me try to showare the.This screen so but you saw how we hit.The yeah the launch button the launch.Button let's see so when after you hit.The launch button.The full screen let's see I wonder if.This is going to work it's not going to.Look as good as it looks on.The um okay let's see.Are you able to see the game now y we.See the game okay sweet so I mean.Obviously it looks a lot more organized.On the screen because it's just the.Screen size but uh you can see the.Bitcoin price changing here and then I.Would guess that it's going up uh 5sec.Passes.By um a loss that's that's why I don't.Do a lot of uh day-to-day trading but uh.Keep going keep trying and.Win so and this is this is basically it.In the nutshell what we found uh to be.Very exciting for people is the.Leaderboard uh and funny enough uh we.Have a rot I hope I'm saying it right.With his Stellar uh logo which is uh.Super super exciting uh and what's even.More exciting is that there's two people.Who play this game more than I do and I.Feel like I refer so many people to this.Game uh um but you know we have uh.Mounder Trevor Trevor Hoffman he he.Shows it a lot sends it to a lot of.People but uh these two guys have.Absolutely crushed it and it's amazing.To see this support from these people um.So you get you get 10 points for.Guessing the price right you get um Five.Points deducted for guessing it wrong.And you can also invite friends so this.Is a very important feature for for us.For the future of the uh product.Development for the wallet itself.We allow you to earn points every time.You refer um a friend and if you click.Invite friends it allows you to it gives.You a customized link that you can share.With your friends uh but other than that.This is uh this is uh the game it's not.Uh a crazy amount of uh stuff that has.Been uh that has that that that has been.Uh built but it is an engaging fun game.That has been uh allowing us to attract.Clients and U talk to clients to get.Their feedback and see what they want in.The market I I think it's personally I.Think it's a brilliant idea it's a great.Way to to get some people excited get.Get some awareness around what you're.Building and and and your brand and and.Something that's that I've always.Noticed H I'm actually surprised you're.Not wearing your ramp me Daddy CAP today.You got the T-shirt because you guys are.Always promoting your business always uh.I' I've so I've personally experienced.It like Monday when we had the event in.S Francisco there was Ramy daddy napkins.There was Ry daddy water bottles there.Was every everywhere and and uh and when.When you guys uh said that it was it was.Time to get go out and get changed for.The event I I was thinking okay maybe.These maybe they going to show up in.Suits today but no it was t-shirts with.Ry Daddy all over it and yeah know it's.I mean I think it's worth mentioning.Talking about the Geo yeah and the idea.I even heard a story from one of the.Other participants from from dreu uh.There was something about that uh you.Guys went out to eat at a restaurant and.I guess they were out on napkins or.Something and then out of your bag you.Pull napkins with ram daddy QR code and.Logos on it yeah yeah yeah we we we.Tried to get creative uh with with The.Branding I think.Um there is I mean I I think when it.Comes to branding it's a very it could.Be a very expensive and and um resource.Consuming um really bottomless bit of of.Just branding and marketing money that.You can put in and we know that uh.Firsthand from you know our previous.Company that we were at itust amazing.Brand the strongest brand and it's very.Important for itust was doing crypto.IRAs um but unfortunately don't have the.Budget of uh itust Capital right uh so.We have been trying to come up with the.Creative strategies to uh to do brand.Awareness without uh spending a lot of.Money on it and I think that's that's a.Strong.Um that that that that has to be present.For a found founder to be uh successful.To scale a retail facing product uh so.Yeah I completely agree and and some um.I've sometimes have discussions with.With other uh Founders in in the crypto.Blockchain space and sometimes they have.A difficult time onboarding non- crypto.People or non- crypto users and I think.By introducing the game first and by.Creating some awareness some curiosity.Around your brand I think is a great way.To onboard uh people who are maybe not.Super much into crypto or meme coins and.Get them excited about it and and I.Think uh I think that's that's something.That that I think is really going to be.Interesting to follow you guys and see.See your gain some tracks and get those.People that may not be super familiar.With having to co coins or tokens or.Nfts uh make it more like an everyday.Thing I think I think you're doing a.Great job with that uh so yeah it'll be.Interesting to follow um we only have a.Few minutes left but I'm super curious.About what does your timeline look like.When it comes to the wallet and and be.Able to toh to have to use meme coins so.The timeline for the wallet is uh we're.We're I am personally hoping for about.Six weeks.Um.And I you know so far I think we've been.Very strong on delivering everything.That we that we promise on time um so.We're trying to stick to that um.History in traction um but we but we.Have been there's there's no shortage of.Stuff to um to do while the product is.Not out and I think establishing strong.Presence in brand is definitely one of.Those things which is what we've been.Working on very hard um as far as as far.As the wallet and the mem coins we we.Are going to launch in in the in the.Next six weeks with a with with a set of.Uh with most likely with a closed beta.For for some of the users to give us.Feedback um and uh we've been yeah we've.Been we've been moving towards that.That's super.Exciting Okay I uh I think that's all we.Have time for today but I would love to.Do a followup when uh when you hit the.Maybe when you hit test net or hit the.Main net uh maybe do a followup and and.See how it looks like um but so far it's.Been super exciting to to follow follow.Your journey and yeah see see the hustle.You do to to get people excited about it.I think that's that's uh something a lot.Of startups can learn a lot from so so.Thank you so much for joining today.Absolutely thank thank you very much and.Our goal is to drive adoption for uh.Crypto and blockchain which is which is.Extremely hard to do if you have to.Worry about all the seat phrases all of.The all of these Crypton native things.And as you know I want people I already.Got my mom pretty involved in crypto she.Has crypto in her Ira she has crypto.Wallets she does all of that uh my my.Next goal is to get my grandma involved.And uh she is she's gonna be a client of.Uh a customer of rant me Daddy and.She'll be trading memes H so that's.That's that's the goal and that's what.We're working towards that's amazing.Okay thank you so much for joining today.And I'm looking forward to doing a.Followup uh when uh when you have more.To share I think that could be.Interesting to do awk thank you so much.For joining thanks for having me thank.You
