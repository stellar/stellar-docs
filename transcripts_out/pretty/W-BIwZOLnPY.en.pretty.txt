Okay so we're live streaming it right.Now.All right we are live .So welcome to today's panel my name is.Ankur liu I'm a program manager at the.Stellar development foundation or sdf.For short. SDF just quickly about SDF SDF is a.Non-profit organization founded in 2014.To support the development and growth of.The open source Stellar network and so.Before we begin a little context so.Stellar was founded in 2014 after.Bitcoin before ethereum and handles.Millions of transactions each day.Submitted by businesses banks.Governments and developers.All over the world to build innovative.Financial products and services and.Stellar uses an energy efficient .Syncing mechanism specifically designed.For remittances and payments so.Transactions are processed within.Seconds and cost way less than a penny.So what can you actually do with Stellar.So on Stellar you can issue your own.Assets as tokens on the network think.Stable coins such as usdc.Cryptocurrencies real estates and nfts.Practically anything.Then you can also trade these tokens.Peer-to-peer through a built-in.Decentralized exchange or automated mark.Maker functionality.And you can also transform currency as.You send it which is a powerful feature.To streamline cross-border payments but.Let's get back to why you are all here.Today. we have launched a blockchain.Bootcamp in partnership with dfs lab to.Support the boom of blockchain crypto.Activities across the african continent.This was in fall 2021 and each content.Each company spent a week at our virtual.Boot camp going through.The design sprint process with the.Guidance of a mentor and also access to.Technical support from the Stellar.Development seller developers and at.The end of the week everyone came.Together for a virtual demo day with.Select investors invited to join the.Audience.We have we have like in total like.Nine companies were selected and went.Through the boot camp and we were.Definitely not disappointed with the.Results they participated they built.A proof of concept they .Demoed at the demo day and or each.Earned an award valued at either five or.Fifteen thousand dollars depending on.The depth of their solution.So I'm very excited for today because.We have five of those nine companies.Joining me.To discuss their experience to discuss.Their growth and also some tips and.Tricks for future blockchain particip.Bootcamp participants.So without further ado I wanted to start.Some introductions starting with.Open.Hi thanks ankit for introducing me.And hello everyone my name is ope and..Ceo and co-founder of bonafide I'm gonna.Find stemmed out of another product.Called money me and I would give.Most of that credit to the SDF .Bootcamp and that we had nice to meet.You higgins.Awesome well that's great to hear .Great so next up is ben from stacks.Hey everyone I'm ben I'm the ceo of.Stacks and stacks is a universal.Payment app for africa.Where what we've done is given you one.App where you can link all of your bank.Accounts and mobile wallets.To a single interface where you can then.Transact without a data connection.That's really our big kind of unique.Selling point is that it works offline.And then what we're doing with Stellar.Is adding support for crypto where.We'll have a self self-custody.Multi-token kind of strategy so think.Like metamask but built for africa.Alongside your fiat and integrated with.Your fiat accounts i'll stop there.Awesome thank you for introducing.Yourself. then.Phone bank christian and michael.Hey everyone and I'm chris duffis I'm.The founder of phone bank and we offer a.Unique on-ramp where we bridge the.Less than one percent of the world.Population within nearly 100 of the.World population that have.Access to a mobile.Phone. and we.Really enjoyed our.Experience at the dfs boot camp and and.The Stellar product we think it has.A great applicability to reducing.Friction as in our marketplace.Awesome well thank you for introducing.And then honeycoin david and dominic.Hey everyone I'm super excited to be.Here I'm david nander founder and ceo of.Honeycoin I always say I found it to.Describe us it's sort of like if.Coinbase and patreon had a baby and.That's maybe africa.So yeah we're standardized monetization.Platform for both creators and consumers. and basically we exist to make the. payments for goods and services to.Creators and the transfer value across.Ecosystems easy and frictionless thank.You.Thank you for introducing yourself and.Company. cuidro funto please introduce.Sure thanks nk .Credo is an online platform factoring.Platform actually I should first of all.Introduce myself so olofontoboroffice.Co-founder of creature which is an.Online factory platform where.Transactions are streamlined. and our smes on the african.Continents can get paid within 72 hours.By selling their invoices to get fast.Fast cash at favorable rates and we had.A great time at the. at the boot camp where we where we're.Seeing the use of Stellar for our.Product is the fact that we're.Looking for investors we're going to be.Looking for investors to invest in.Buying some of these invoices and we're.Going to be looking at using them for.Cross-border payments as we sort of.Look at transforming currency and.Peer-to-peer so thank you for having me.I'm excited to be here.Awesome yeah we're excited to have you.As well. last stop last but not least at dfs.Lab joseph.Yeah hi everyone joseph from.Dearcuslav here so the fs lab is an.Early stage venture capital firm where.We invest in digital commerce companies.On the continents.Very early pre-seed and seed stage .And we also you know work with.Institutions like the Stellar foundation.To kind of onboard companies .To like play around with innovative.Technologies like Stellar yeah excited.To be here.Thank you yeah we're so excited to have.You and to and thank you all to the.Participants for introducing yourself.And your companies even like just.Rehearing what you're building on is is.Just like it's really great to hear.And I'm like also like the way you are.Growing and the way you are in really.Innovating in the space is is is.Magnificent so I guess I know all of.That but the participants don't know yet.So you know right now I'm going to start. stop sharing my screen and I'm going.To go into the discussion.And for all these though you watching.In the zoom there will also be.You can also ask questions and I will.See if there's some time to answer.But.Without further ado let's let's head.Into the discussion so.I will start with with stacks with.Ben.Can you quickly talk us through your.Solution that you've prototyped during.The previous boot camp.Yeah so in the last boot camp we came in.Really with just the question of of how.Do we step our foot for or just get our.Toe into crypto.We knew that we wanted to do something.With usdc and what we what we ended.Up building in the bootcamp was a.Prototype of showing the ability to.Create a usdc wallet self-custody wallet.And to send money over usdc in stacks.Without using a mobile data connection.And so what's kind of novel there.Is that we our core technology has this.Ability to automate ussd so just for.Our our friends on the west who might.Not know what that is.It's this legacy gsm channel it's.Ubiquitous across africa and asia.And it basically is using part of the.Voice channel to to transmit data and so.What we've done is we've used that.Technology in an app.To make services work offline and even.Though you're you're actually having a.Synchronous connection with the server. we've done that with over 100 bank.And mobile money services today and 10.African markets but we wanted to start.Offering crypto services as well and.Give our users basically a us dollar.Account and so that's where Stellar.And usdc came in.And so what we demonstrated was just .Turning off so at the end of the.Bootcamp you turned off mobile data on.Your phone open stacks created a usdc.Wallet and sent usdc to another USDC.Address all with mobile data entirely.Disabled.Wow that's that's really impressive i.Think like.Like this is one of the key key like.Issues also like having being able to.Provide offline services is really key.Especially in regions where.Infrastructure is lacking so. definitely so you know.Can you tell us a bit about you know.Your plans for launch and also a little.Bit so I saw that you've recently.Published that you've acquired 2.2.Million dollars in seed funding which is.Amazing. congratulations yeah.Honestly congratulations and like kind.Of like how has your company grown so.Like kind of what are your plans for.Launch and what is that what is what.Does growth look like already.Yeah so we're getting ready for a big.Push so come april that's when we.Plan to actually implement the the.Proof of concept we built in the lab or.In the boot camp and so april we.Intend to push that live and really.Start marketing from may at least in.Kenya and a few other markets we're.Still figuring out which markets to.Start with but from may you'll see.That stax users pretty much anywhere on.The continent will be able to create.That usdc account and and send money.And receive money without data where.We want this to go is really kind of.Like a metamask for africa kind of built.For africa play and the idea there is.Self-custody so you have your crypto you.Have your keys we don't touch any of.That and then the goal is that.You'll be able to.Buy sell.You know swap hold all of your tokens.You can take them from stacks if you.Want to any other web3 service because.You've got your keys.But the goal is that you can do that all.In stacks right alongside your bank.Accounts and your multiple wallets and.So then the big lift for us over time is.Going to be how we stitch those things.Together so that you can have a seamless.Kind of fiat crypto crypto to fiat.Experience whatever token you have.Whatever fiat accounts you have so .Technically us launching that's going to.Be very quick from me but where the hard.Work is is going to be in stitching.Everything together you know based on.Stellar anchor here or hack there or.Whatever so that's really our plan.Great yes and then you know I think.That's really exciting and then also.Like having acquired the 2.2 million.Dollars in seat funding do you want to.. give a few more details about that.And how that came to be.Yeah shout out to nomis ventures to.World within ventures launch africa.Ventures orange down some others that.Participated .It was really useful actually coming.Out of the boot camp to just show that.We were we were serious about our our.Ambitions to get into crypto and that we.Had kind of we were able to.Get a kind of trust mark or a seal of.Approval from the community and so.That actually really helped us raise.Money and and actually got us in front.Of investors we hadn't spoken with.Before so if you've everyone here has.Been fundraising too often I'm sure but.Like when you're pitching traditional.Vcs that's one kind of segment or slice.Of the pie and then when you start.Pitching crypto that's a whole other big.Slice of pie that wasn't available so.That's been super helpful to us.Awesome well congratulations and I think.Like another big player here that has.Like received has.Started quite a lot of seat funding is.Phone bank so chris and michael i.Would love to bring you to the stage and.And kind of like wanting to hear a bit.More like how what was that what was.That like like the the boot camp what.Impact did that have and how have you.Seen phone bank growth since then.So I might start out at that michael.And I we actually met through this boot.Camp he was our our mentor.And. provided some very sage guidance for.Us and obviously it led to us .Being one of the the finalists.And I and I think in many respects has.Led us to dr drive.Hone our product market focus a lot more. which catalyzed in a 3.5 million.Dollar seed finance thing among .From leading crypto and venture.Investors. so I thought the the the camp was.Really great for us and we actually. in addition to the proceeds from.The camp also received a another Stellar.Grant as we planned to.Incorporate the protocol.Into some programs that we'll be .Launching. .As soon as next week.Wow as soon as next week I'm very.Excited for that yes I heard about it.The marketing grant from SDF that's a.Yeah.That's great great news I'm very excited.That you know we were able to support in.That way and you know kind of like going.Back to what you said about like.Michael and kind of coming on boards and.So michael you were a facilitator of the.Team of phone bank team right because.Like okay so to backtrack a real quick.So every team in the boot camp has a.Specific facilitator assigned.And in this case michael was the.Facilitator of phone bank so.Michael what was that like first being a.Facilitator of the team in the boot camp.And now co-founder and head of growth.Africa of stone bank.Yeah thank you thank you very much i.Was actually seated at the same spot .I'm sitting now and chris and i.Met and .I guess it was a bit over in hindsight.It was a bit of a surprise but also.A lesson for me on the.The role of such ecosystem building.Programs like the boot camp it's.Really I think a lot of us maybe might.Have might think about it in terms of.Coming to raise funding.Or accelerating .Some of the products that we are working.On but for me I mean the opportunity.I got was matchmaking or finding.Other ways to to benefit from from this.Network and discord of. of great companies and great founders.So I think that would be my that was.The biggest lesson that I took away from.From from the benefit of such programs.And the kind of value you can derive.From these programs beyond just .The old-fashioned tried and tested .Funding it can also be a place where you.Could meet potential partners it could.Be a place where you could you could.Meet.Co-founders like myself you know so who.Knows so just look at it as a.As a.As a a.A ball of .Of value that you can exploit .Depending on whatever needs you have.Yeah it's it's it's amazing I love that.Like matchmaking that you really.Bring that up it's like a book campus a.Matchmaking event.I mean I think like.It has actually like it's like when we.First started I had like you know like.For me also like going in like okay like.We are doing this and then coming out.It's like all of these connections that.You really build and I was also like oh.It's going to be like a virtual event.I'm not quite sure what that's going to.Be like but the connection that we made.And kind of the lasting relationship.Have also like on me like really helped. and kind of like last question for.For either of you to answer. because like last in a prep session. we we also like talked a bit about.Kind of like your business model and.Kind of like what.What what business model what is the.Business model that I have allowed for.Like such growth in the recent growth in.The company.So.We are.At its core an exchange where we.Match individuals and businesses that.Might trade in prepaid air time. with.Individuals seeking digital money.And I think that's sort of the.Inflection point that's taken off in our.In our business.Where.You know people are trying to go from.The fiat world into crypto web 3 and all.And even traditional finance but in a.The lowest friction sort of a path.And I think.Exploring and you know and partnering.With Stellar. I think is a is a great way to reduce.Remove that friction in that process and.I think you know I mentioned that a.Couple times because that's something.That that's key to sort of user better.User experience and act actually.In.My journey.Through sort of product discovery in.This Stellar ecosystem I was very.Pleasantly.Surprised as to the progress.Of.Many of the developments whether it's.The amm and. the other various Stellar products.And I think in large part because it is.A.You know a low-cost.Eco you know environmentally friendly.Ecosystem I think it touches all the.Major items and it's there's been.Significant improvement and so we're.Excited to be partners.I thought that was all muted. awesome well that's great to hear.Like we are also excited to to be in.Connection with all of you and SDF is.Really here to support. those who are building on Stellar.Sellers open source by the way anyone.Can choose to build on a network but we.As a non-profit really try to see how we.Can support people that are building.Real world solutions on the network so.You know I'm very it's very great to.Hear this as well and then kind of i.Wanted to go into bonafide so a.Few questions for ope actually .What was your experience with the boot.Camp and.Yeah what stood out.Thank you and kay so like I mentioned.Earlier when we came up into the into.The boot camp we had a different.Product right that was a digital bank. for for migrants and we had.Already started experiencing some.Challenges. in terms of well the product was a.Great product did they really.Communicate or fulfill our mission .Which is basically to like democratize.Opportunities in general right and.The bootcamp helped us to.Really walk through a design thinking.Process to actually answer some of these.Questions and come up with something.That's really simple.Basic and works and for everyone now .The result of that is bonafide that.Digital wallet that lets .Any anyone save send and receive in.Digital dollars and these is available.To to to all africans or one billion.Africans who are currently you know.Not connected to the global world.Of commerce or trade and and that's.That's massive by itself and also.Something we're very excited .About that happened within the boot camp.Was being able to kind of fashion out.This no lost price that allows people to.Actually kind of win big amounts of.Money right without risk of losing any.Money I mean.That that's like super super fantastic.And then that's something that's new .That will bring it .To the continent on that so the boot.Camp really helped us.Pull all of that together and come up.With this simple product we're still.Pre-launched we've already been.Transacting millions of dollars based.On what we've.On a monthly basis the 2 million last.Time last month based on what what.We've done so far and soon we'll be.Going out big time into the into the.Market yeah.Oh wow that's a that that's a lot .Congratulations on on that type of.Volume already before or before. that's amazing yeah because i.Remember like we were like trying to.Figure out the use case and obviously.Like you know you know there are some.Some like restrictions we can do and i.Kind of like work out a way that really.Like is a great business model so yeah.I'm very excited about that and being.Able to use blockchain use Stellar to.Allow such features is just something.You cannot do with any other technology.Really so you know a little bit .Back back checking back so you have.Been part of like money me right and.Money me has been in the Stellar.Ecosystem for quite some time .Can you explain a little bit about what.Moneyb is and did the bootcamp kind.Of experience change anything towards.Your engagement with Stellar.Yes so money me like I mentioned.Earlier or the digital bank focused.On on migrants right and we we built.That product within very strict context.Of u.s regulatory infrastructure. so.You know a couple of things you know.Controlled by the banks as agents of the.Banks u.s persons only not fully.Democratized and you know we were trying.To kind of do something that was a bit.More democratized and that was what .Bonafide was so how did this.Stellar ecosystem up there beyond you.Know just the boot camp in itself i.Think the relationships we we got we got.Very very good referrals to other.Classes ecosystem that we could .That we could work with right the.Folks that we had the folks at wire.Those were all you know relationships.That were broken by by by the. Stellar . Stellar organization so so that was.Really helpful too.Great yeah I know that that's that's.Really great to know and it's also like.Being able to. grow in the relationship develop and.I think like that's also something i.Want to point out to.Future like or like to current seller.Company .Ecosystem companies build on Stellar.It's like you can.Always like develop a relationship even.Through this bootcamp but also through.Other other avenues and we definitely.Encourage that.So thank you so much opa that was a.Really great outline I will come back to.That later ..I wanted to hear about like funta i.Wanted to hear from you of kwedru. and so so creatoru was in a kind of.Like an early development stage when you.Applied to the boot camp what made.You decide to apply.Thank you okay I think for us one of.The reasons why we decided to apply for.The boot camp was because we were really.Like you mentioned really early stage we.Wanted to sort of prove or sort of.Use the the boot camp to sort of make.Sure that we were going down the right.Path. and you know.The bootcamp definitely.Exceeded our expectation in making sure. I mean we mentioned the design sprint.Being able to make sure that you know.The idea that we had was something.That was not only legitimate but that.Would work and I think some of the.Other things that came out of the boot.Camp was also you know just this.Additional idea of you know being able.To. get investors because the way equity.Works you know it's an essay SMS vendors.And then investors and you know now with.The bootcamp helped us to sort of.Highlight or crystallize the fact that.We can then really go cross-border.Payment and you know tap you know no.Matter how small investments from.Investors from across the world right.And so that was one of the things that.Came out of the boot camp and we're so.Excited that .Not only did we finish the bootcamp .We got five thousand dollars which we're.Excited about but then we were able to. transition into the the.Development community and we were.Able to get additional funding that has.Allowed us now to hire for additional.Engineers and we have some funding for. for marketing so we're super excited. and even though we're still.Pre-launched I think of the next.Maybe a few months what everybody's.Gonna be hearing about creatures so.Excited super excited.Yeah oh I'm I'm I'm excited to hear that.Also about the scf and I'm coming back.To that in a later question. but quickly like kind of like about.The boot camp experience because you did.Mention you know because we had I i.Believe like companies in the booth.Came from from very different levels.Of development. and yeah I kind of wanted to if.You wanted to kind of go through what.Your experience was and what you liked.About it .And and kind of like what impact that.Had on your business in in a bit more.Detail.Sure so i'll be the first to say that.I'm a female non-tech founder. and so even coming into the boot.Camp there was a bit of trepidation.Because I was like oh my god what am i.Getting myself into but I will say that.You know not only was I able to.Keep up with the design sprint and.With everything that was going on i.Think there was just a sense of at least.For me there was a sense of okay you.Know the people who are you know.There's a big network out there that are.Willing to support. I mean you just even you anki I mean.Just the encouragement along the way .Our mentor was joseph benson I don't.Know I mean just the encouragement to.The team I mean we'll just you know i.Think there are no words to describe and.I think also just give us another level.Legitimacy in terms of what we were.Trying to do so for me I think like i.Said it was just the network to see that.There are other people I'm trying to do.The same thing but to know that there's.A network of people who are like sort of.Cheering us on and who want us to really.Succeed is is just was just.Phenomenal.Yeah yeah well I'm super happy to.Hear that yes I'm 100 behind all of you. and definitely I'm super excited.That you're able to grow on it you're.Also wanting to continue your journey.With Stellar so thank you so much fonto.And also like.Big claps to all women founders here.Like it's women history month this .This .March so.Big class honestly like I'm super.Excited to have you know each of you but.Also you know.In particular because it's women history.Month on board big claps all women.Founders and I you know like so i.Guess going a bit into that it's a.Little surprised question but .Did did that change anything being a.Women founder like what would you kind.Of like say also to encourage other.Women founders in the space and.Especially in blockchain as well .To get started.So I would say .Do it afraid but do it you know. you know because you're not ever.Going to.I don't think you're going to ever get.100 comfortable so just you just need to.Do it and even if you don't I mean one.Of the things that I think okay.Mentioned that the boot camp helped him.To do was sort of pivot a bit I think.You know this was a space to be able to.After you you're done with the design.Screen you start to sort of question.Okay will this work won't this work and.It the the bootcamp was a safe space to.Sort of explore those ideas so.Especially for female founders again i.Can't say it enough we don't get as.Much support I would like to see but.This is a really safe space this is a.Place where you get a lot of support so.I just really want to encourage a lot of.Female founders who are maybe on the.Fence to to make sure that they apply. and they will get the best of support. that I can attest to personally so.Thank you so much for mentioning that.Yeah I think like we cannot stress.Enough it's like if you are you know.Like new to blockchain or you're kind of.Like on the fence like I think like it's.Very important just to just to apply.Just to get started just to get in there. and who knows what will happen.There's a lot of excitement in the space.A lot of opportunity and yeah so I'm.Super excited so before we kind of go.Into also recommendations I wanted to.Highlight a very special project as well.That I mentored I'm very excited about.I'm excited about all of you by the way.Just but honeycomb in particular i.Was meant I was a facilitator and I was.Part of the the.Boot camp process so very excited dave.And dominic please .What was that what was participating in.The in the boot camp like.Yeah participating in the boot.Comforts. it was grueling.I like to tell david that on the.Third day of the boot company he was.Directed because I remember he didn't.Sleep one day on the night before them a.Day but it was so much fun we were.Truly stretched but we.Were able to like lay the ground up for.Something that we.Pretty much worked on for months.Afterwards and we're really really.Grateful because of the bootcamp it.Allowed us to. explore.How we we went we went in would come to.The question of how do we help our.Creators and their funds be able to like.You know send receive crypto and we.Walked out of the bootcamp wanting to.Build a whole nft marketplace and we've.Been able to do that at least we've.Done a proof of concept for it we.Wanted them in the bootcamp we were.Able to like implement a fast checkout.Flow for our creators being able to.Like receive xlm and like I mean.In a in a way that would be.Pretty easy for.Non-crypto natives to be able to support.Their creators and that was so much fun.And I mean it really stretched us.And we went ahead immediately after to.Just keep on building on that and I mean.It's been it's been really good since.Yeah and just to add .I think one of the best things about the.The boots camp is it forced us.To have a sense of urgency I think .Everyone in this panel can vouch for.That there's there's a certain.Lethargicness or latency that comes in.Your kind of startup whether you know.You have your roadmap on notion and you.Queue it up for three months down the.Line it feels like it never comes you.Always work.Yes with some urgency but it's never.Really like oh this is next week that we.Need to do you know a specific thing and.And that sort of like would have put us.In the frame of mind of thinking if if i.Literally had a week to map out a sprint.And get to a point where we actually.Have an mvp or something that we need to.Ship out what life looked like and i.Think it's something that also helped.You know to to to instill that culture.In in the company itself like you know.As we expand the team and you know just.Carrying carrying that three-day sprint.Culture you know holistically across.Everything that we do and .The.Growth attraction has been you know.Enormous up until this point like we've.We've gone from you know free bootcamp.We're doing maybe a thousand dollars a.Day on the high side now we're.Processing up like up to a hundred.Thousand dollars in a single day and.That's exciting to us yeah.And the validation that we're able to.Accomplish in the bootcamp.And you know carrying that forward you.Know building a end-to-end platform we.Launched our escrange in one of the.First platforms to launch a fractional.Nft protocol that we also brought over.To Stellar which is super exciting you.Know so just just so much that came out.Of it and.Also just being a part of the Stellar.Ecosystem and which is you know.Constantly growing and and super.Supportive on every front especially.Sdf. and and having you as a as a mentor.Was pretty great to anyone watching.This I'm biased and I was if you guys.Jumping in anki should be your mentor.Well that's great to hear but I think.Like we had great mentors on board too.Right and I think everyone here like.Feel free to also chip in and kind of.Like tell how grueling of an ex well.Grueling but good of an experience it.Was to have this like busy.Packed.Three-day boot camp but actually having.Clear results at the anti-demo day and.That and it's like having that.Like working with facilitator very.Closely yeah I would love to hear if.Anyone you know wants to chip in on on.What david and dominic just said.Who else had a grueling experience i.Believe .Was it.Phone bank I believe chris and you.You jumped in from the from the u.s.Yeah so I was in the I was in the u.s so.I .It was a very long week getting up at.Early east african time to participate.Just to to demonstrate the committedness.Of the program I think someone called.Me and woke me up the first morning to.Make sure that I was showed up on.Time. but I'm actually forever grateful for.That . because then we were able to be fully.Engaged and that just showed the level.Of . you know the sincerity of the.Engagement for the program so but.Maybe get some sleep the night before.And plan to go to bed early if you're.Going to join from other parts of the.World.Yeah and just to add in .I think we still have that problem with.Chris now because because he's on dc.Time I usually have to have my.Working hours go all the way up to.7 00 p.m in east africa time yeah but.Just to add to david's .Point around grilling I think it's also.About the.Kind of vibe you get with your your.Mentor facilitator because even at phone.Bank I felt with chris. chris was a really mature founder i.Think he is mentioned it exited a couple.Of companies so when I met him.I really felt I had.An easy time working with him we really.Built up a great relationship together.So it doesn't have to be all grueling i.Think it's also about finding.Like the right cadence with with your.Mentor and the founder you're assigned.And my and michael was pretty .Great to work with and I think.That.Looking at some of the other.Relationships while I don't know if.Others joined their the companies like.Michael but I do think they they spent.Some time in in providing the matching.And I think all the mentors are very.Thoughtful in terms of how they .Helped guide us through the process.Yeah that's great to know I'm I'm very.Excited about you know what happened.I was also like quite surprised by the.Level of engagement that facilitators.Were like that facilitators had and i.Was also like oh wow these days.Especially the first two days like we.Were like.In the zoo and well I guess like was on.Discord or something we were like in.Discord we were on. let me see like we had the slides we.Had the sigma you know and and also.Like to the.Folks watching like obviously like in.Person and hopefully we can do some.In-person bootcamps sometimes and I can.All meet you in person.What was kind of like what surprised you.About this like virtual model and like. like like what was your experience.With that format and it's it's an open.Question and then i'll start to get into.Some more specific questions again.Okay did you have any oh yeah ben .Feel free to yeah go in.Yeah just the follow through is is.What surprised me the most so even this.Event for example is another convening.Of you know all the participants and.We've we've had various conversations.Since anka I know you've reached out.Multiple times and so i've been a part.Of different boot camps over the years i.Actually even worked at dfs lab for a.For a couple years and I think the.Follow through from Stellar and dfs lab.Has been really fantastic and it's.Clear that this wasn't just a.Transaction you know like let's let's do.An event let's get some press around it.There's actually real relationships.Formed and invested in and as as a.Participant it's clear to me that that's.The intent of the organizers and so i.Really appreciate that and I do feel.Like there's kind of an emerging.Community here I don't feel like an.Outsider to the ecosystem so just kudos.To you all the organizers for for the.Follow-through there and really.Investing in that relationship.Yeah yeah and kudos to you for also like.Continuing your relationship on Stellar.It is it is definitely. so not without its challenges right. because like it you know this space.Is a new space.Right it's a growing space as like i.Think someone mentioned earlier like we.Have.Constantly new technology coming out and.People will adapt to that and implement.It and grow in the network it's it's.It's a.We are growing and there's growing pains.Coming with this not only from.Technology but also from you know the.Regulatory standpoints to you know users.Users experience and kind of like work.We're at the forefront of innovation so.I kind of wanted to hear a bit more.About opa's experience .In in this like well because like.Obviously you know we've talked a lot.About how everyone's had a great time.How everyone has grown so much but now i.Also kind of like very important want to.Highlight some of the challenges and.So opel like what are some of the.Challenges in getting a bonus what were.Some of the challenges and getting.Bonafide to where it is right now.Thank you okay and I love the fact.That you you're trying to kind of point.Out the good and the bad thankfully.There was no ugly.So I think one of the biggest challenges.Especially for folks who are.Developing .You know blockchain or whether it's.Cryptocurrency specifically is.Navigating the the regulatory .Space number one .It's not really clear if you're.Following the news if you're looking at.What other people are doing you tend to.Think that makes it writing but might.Not necessarily be the writing .And .Also in terms of in innovation .Some some countries like a bit .Should I say open around you know what's.Happening cryptocurrency I'm innovation.Some are kind of really closed and.Loves you know available companies but.It's you as the right domicile what.Does that look like for your partners .Do they like you do they love it would.They want to be a delaware company but.You know a crypto license in some way or.Some money transfer license is none of.The country you know do you need one.License in the u.s.That allows you to be much out of record.But unless it's really operating in the.U.s there's a lot of things that we have.To kind of figure out the the ad way and.I mean while this is the evolving one of.The things I kind of said after.The other boot camp and I just want to.Repeat it yeah I'm for everybody's.Benefit for prosperity prosperity's sake. is that it'll be helpful if .A foundation like Stellar or a consulting.Foundations you know publish.Information out there not necessarily.Legal information you should have to.Consult your own lawyer about what old.What works and as far as we know it i.Mean they create the world on regulatory.On a country by country basis what are.The basic things you know you need to.To to have me by that play point of view.So we have to do x you know to be a.Pilot for example to move money for.Example or to just play our web tree.Those things would really help to foster.Innovation because the reality is folks.Are confused nobody wants to go to jail.For trying to change the world right.And we all want to do good and we need.All the help we can get.Yes no I totally agree on that front.It's it's it can be difficult navigating.Especially like like and not only in.In all types of countries every country.Right now every government is figuring.Out what do regulations look like around.This new paradigm of internet.Applications and I think like as a.Foundation we definitely.Are on the forefront of policy but.There's always room for improvement so.Definitely I think yeah these are all.Great recommendations and we should look.Into that for and like as we grow as a.Team and I think like it's not only on.The foundations and I think it's as a.Community as a whole.Being part of it like like getting each.Other in the know and sharing like.What's going on I think it's really.Important so we can all grow as a.Community anyone that wants to add to.That because I think it's a very.Important interesting aspect and also.Like not only challenges with like.Regulatory but also like others so i.Would love to before we kind of go.Into recommendations for book and.Participants I would love to like kind.Of like reflect on what happened. hi nk I just wanted to say I think.Danielle had his hand up danielle is one.Of my co-founders from quidro but i.Also just wanted to sort of echo exactly.What okay was saying but I think one of.The things that we're bumping into as.We're building is this whole .Regulatory. ecosystem especially in the us.And you know I'm too cute to go to jail.So I'm like I need to figure out where.Exactly.What exactly is going on and you know i.Found myself going down this whole of.Reading about fincen and you know just a.Lot of information so I'm going to be.Hitting up me afterwards to say okay.Dude please what did you do and just you.Know maybe clear the way but I know.That danielle also wanted to mention.A few things as well from his experience.So daniel if you're there please go.Ahead.Thank you so .Hi anki hi everyone I just wanted to.I think it was a question I was asked.Earlier I risked mine I think somebody.Else also mentioned something I just.Wanted to say that these are my.Experience I think all the major thing i.Could pick from the boot camp.Was the personalized.Mentorship I think .Mr joe really did a good work because.I'm sure some of us be.The engagements and.Sometimes I feel like drifting off like.Okay let me just be in the meeting and.Not be in the meeting or being the whole.Thing and not being it you know but mr.Joe will not even give you the.Opportunity he's always engaging.And whatever and at the end of the day.You realize that yes it was really worth.It and.I really was not surprised at the fact.That I get I guess everyone who.Participated actually came out with.Something and that was because of the.All personalized thing in my opinion.Everybody was carried along no matter.What you are building you all everybody.Got something out of it and it really.Helped and I'm sure everybody's doing.What they need to do at this point in.Time I just want to have that and say.Shout out to the scf team and .The dsl lab thank you very much.Yeah yeah I thank you so much to daniel.I didn't realize you you had your hand.Up I guess like I'm in the wrong.In the wrong setting in zoom but.Definitely like thanks so much for for.Speaking up I think you know I'm.Very happy that this personalized .Like feature really works and you know.Very relying here on dfs lab for the.Design sprint you know boot camp of.Course so joseph do you want to add a.Few words to that. yeah so I think that's one of the.Things that makes.The bootcamps quite like.Special and engaging it's the fact that.We have these mentors who are kind of.Really working with you to make sure.That you are not like dropping off.Along the way and just basically you.Know trying to help you find clarity .So we have like a bunch of so.You know you can be a player who has.Already you know who has a ton of.Experience building products and has you.Know had money me.Or you can be phonto who just like.Started working with engineers and he's.Still trying to figure it out and you.Know there's there's going to be someone.Who can help you and walk you through.You know you know stuff you know during.The bootcamp. I think it's also very important that.You know like everyone has spoken about.Like you know the involvement of the.Stellar team right so you know if.You wanted to understand like a business.Case right for what you're building it.Was pretty easy to talk to someone and.Say hey help me figure this out and if.You're just ready to like delve into the.Code and you know the test nets was.Available that's like really stable.Enough for you to delve in so. I think that you know that's like the.Whole package you get you know with with.The bootcamp generally.Yes yes definitely thank you for for.Providing some more details around that.And I think like important to note is.That the bootcamp is not the end right.Even like oh we you know we it is not it.Did feel like the end it definitely felt.Like oh after these days I'm going to.Take I actually took a long vacation off.Oh like man this was a lot and you know.Everyone else like I'm so excited happy.That you know like we had such a good.Time together we really spent the energy.But you know after boot camp it is not.The end it's it's like it's really the.Beginning of of your journey on Stellar.And I think like that you know like i.Think we had very quickly after a bit.Too quickly actually I think we had a.Round of the Stellar community fund fund. which is an open application grant.Program to support Stellar-based.Projects with funding but also.It's really about that it's from from.The community so while SDF provides the.Funds in the scf which is an acronym for.Stellar community fund .The community actually allocates it so.So it's a way of building your.Relationship with community and then.Also growing so.Some of you went through the SDF I think.Like it was a bit early stage in like.Where and you know as we continue to.Grow with the communities .There might be more opportunity there.Will be more opportunities we have.Current round open but one particular .Project that went through is cuidroo and.Kweduru I would love to hear your.Experience and kind of like.Talk a bit about your your experience.With the Stellar community fund and yeah.Explain that yeah you were a winner.Yeah so thank you so much okay so .And I first of all again I have to say.Thank you because you definitely prodded.Us to make sure that we applied. and I think there was still a bit of.The fatigue from the boot camp and we're.Like yeah we'll apply it but anchor.Really really really followed up and.Just said you guys need to get on on top.Of this and which we did and I'm very.Grateful for that because that.Opportunity allowed us to get.Funding of I think was that five.Thousand dollars which has helped us to.Like I mentioned earlier on hire like.Four engineers we're going to do a bit.Of a marketing blitz right now and.Some other cool things and honestly if.We didn't get that funding from the.Community fund you know I would be.Running around like a chicken without.His head looking for money right now.And that has just given us enough time.To sort of really build and build the.Way we want to build so I'm super.Excited I mean one of the things that.You know we.I mean you mentioned discord earlier on.Right which is this.Interesting.Online platform where the developers and.Different three people chime in.And one of the things that that.Process allowed me to.Allow myself and daniel to sort of.Really .To do was to hone our our our our.Product.And and be able to explain to anybody.Who didn't know anything about what we.Were trying to do right and we received.A few questions where I was like huh and.Then you know someone would ask the.Question and just go in and i'll.Scramble back with you know i'll see.Yesterday i'll be like how do we this is.A value point what do we do how do we.Solve this problem so again it was.Teasing us a lot of you know issues.Questions that we needed to start.Thinking about and thinking about it you.Know.Really deeply so and the process wasn't.Difficult to be honest we just had to.Apply and just again make a case for.What we needed the funds for. and we didn't ask for too much money.We just asked for really what we needed.Which I think is also very critical .And we got it so again I'm super excited.I can't say enough about this whole.Process you know I you know like i.Said I you know we're building and I'm.So excited and you know when I talk to.Other founders that I know and you know.I think after that experience everybody.I mentioned were like please where do i.Sign up so I'm expecting that all the.Founders that I know are you know going.To apply for this bootcamp because again.It's giving us just that opportunity to.Be able to build in a way that we're not.Rushed to give us a bit more runway i.Would say and the process was not.Difficult and there was a lot of helpful.People you know chiming in asking.Questions sort of prodding what we're.Trying to do.Yeah and we got the money so yay thank.You thank you thank you scf yes yes yes.Yeah I'm I'm very excited about that.Now I don't know if daniel wants to see.Something but yeah so we're we've.Been in the trenches together and and i.Will say that you know that funding.Has allowed us like I said to hire more.Engineers and I think we're 60 of the.Way. so again like I said very soon we're.Going to have a product and it would not.Have been.Possible without again this funding this.Intervention and to just even know that.We could always come back.And the other thing I have to mention.Quickly to anybody who's watching is.This is like non-dilutive so it wasn't.Nobody asked for equity nobody asked for.Anything this was just okay we believe.In your in your products will be leaving.Your idea here's money that good good.Build and let's see what you have so.Again I can't even say enough of it i.Hope everybody who's listening signs up.Signs up for the boot camp so that you.Can then be recommended for. the scf I can't say it enough so.Thank you anki yeah yeah awesome yeah i.Mean thank you honestly like I think and.For like weekend they also can't control.Their community so while I can always.Encourage you to sign up it's really for.Scf it's the community of both here so.That's a really well the validation and.For any anyone watching like it's a.Great experience but we are coming up on.Time very soon there is one .Question for honeycomb that I really.Wanted to dive into and then dive.Into like some quick recommendations.Before we kind of enter let's.Talk about some details about the boot.Camp since we did start a little bit.Later so if you need to hop . don't don't be shy but yeah so so.David and dominic they delved into your.Project yet but actually your project.Doesn't only use Stellar it also uses.Multiple change and.I would love to for you to give a bit of.Details about that and what does that.Multi-chain future look like and how.Does Stellar really fit in.Yeah thanks for asking that thank you.I'm super happy to join in there so.Yeah and you're absolutely right like.For us you know we.We are strong believers in.Interoperability and and in building.Bridges so that like.There's there's better interaction.Across chains because because there's.Also like you know some value props that.May come from one chain that can be.Found that might not actually be found.On another one and and for us and on an.Infrastructure level what we've.Essentially built is like a cross-train.Bridge for six different blockchains so.That would include cello and polygon.Ethereum Stellar. bitcoin.And flow as well.Oh and harmony and and why that's.Important to us is we believe that in.Order to like you know create true.Utility like we want to actually build.Like a multi-chain platform that allows.Folks to one benefit from the.Value props that a particular blockchain.Might provide but why Stellar is such a.Key component.Of that bridging is one the automated.Marketing making functionality on stella.Is.A lot more affordable and allows for.A lot more.Modifiability than other chains might.Might also provide but you know tying in.One the affordability of the blockchain. two the fact that it's it's very.Programmable in comparison to like.Other blockchains as well allows us then.To build frameworks and protocols on top.Of Stellar that we can then leverage in.Our cross chain bridges so that can be.For swaps which already provide so like.Imagine swapping usdc from xlm to.Ethereum or imagine escorting a.Transaction on polygon and receiving it.On a different chain like like Stellar .For us stella. Stellar as a blockchain.Provides the interoperability and and.Programmable nature that allows us to.Then build like you know really cool.Products around the use cases that we're.Trying to power on top of multiple.Chains which is super exciting to us.Yeah I think I think this is a yeah.Thank you so much for bringing us up and.For explaining that multi-chain nature.Of honeycomb and I think that's also.Like where the future's headed right i.Think like we are kind of in the.Early days of the internet so to speak.Like in the 1980s 1990s like when you.Know like internet started to browse up.You have all these different things and.You know we're all growing as an.Ecosystem and and to find like.Interoperability where needed to really.Because the end goal really is to.Provide support or.Answer the needs for your user audience.Right whichever way is best so I'm.Very excited for that and I'm also very.Excited that david and nominee to see.Your product really grow. and also receive funding but we are.Definitely definitely on time now and i.Just you know before we dive into kind.Of like a bit of the details of the boot.Camps and the discussion.I wanted from each of from whoever.Wants to give give their opinion a.Kind of like if you were.Like if you were all going all over.Again you would apply to the boot camp.Like what would you really what would.You recommend new boot camp .Participants . to for yeah to do to do or like for.Any advice you wanted to give. I think I can chime in there first.I would say just keep an open mind the.Thing that you think you might be.Entering that we're going to build might.Not be the actual thing that you'd end.Up building which is a very.It's very good to be open minded if you.Stay rigid it might limit you from you.Know the very thing that you probably.Would you know be more better off.Building instead of the one that you had.In your mind going into the boost.Yeah go go ahead it's free for all now.Okay so I think my advice to other.People who are coming in is .Just have an open mind like I said.Earlier on the kind of value that you.Can get from the.Stella.Blockchain network which is more like .It's a network not just a bootcamp so i.Think this is.That kind of perspective on the value of.This bootcamp I think something else.Just some general advice for founders.Out there.I think my co-founder chris mentioned.That it's really important to have a.Product that that's relatable that's.Easy to onboard that really takes out.And abstracts away the some of the.Complexities of the.Early internet like anchor said and i.Think for me the other component which.Is something that I found to.From phone bank is.Solving problems.In africa right now you know and a lot.Of those problems are how can we get.More young people jobs how can we get.More young people.Earning in the gig economy how can we.Likely leave them of some of their daily.Expenses whether it's air time or data.Or whatever else you know just.Whatever it is you can do to help these.Young people their pockets and they are.Not living I think it's really going to.Go.A long way in addressing those problems.And and as someone who's running growth.Activities for phone bank it really.Makes it easy to sell the product I'm.Having the easiest time selling the.Because I'm just telling people look.This is something that could help you .Save up on your airtime and your data.Bills per month you know that's a very.Strong proposition so.Those two points for me.I was going to say .You know I would encourage everybody to.Just apply apply for the bootcamp.You know don't.You know I mean yeah just apply because.I think you know once you sort of get.Over the hump of application and you get.Accepted it sort of unfolds and unfolds.Itself where you know the the amount.Of support. both technical and just.Emotional and you know everything comes.Into play. but also.You know the opportunities that this.Wall sort of opens up like you said i.Think you know anybody who's in doubt as.To whether this is a wave of the future.Or not needs to you really get with the.Program and so to be part of of of this.Sort of not necessarily wild wild west.But I think that unfolding be part of.That journey is very critical. and again you're we're all part of a.Network now of people who are sort of.Trying to figure this out together so.You're not by yourself you're not alone. so again i'll just say please please.Please.Apply and opportunities will sort of.You know one thing sort of builds up.After the other you do this and then.Another opportunity opens up you know .You know through anki's suggestion we.Applied for the berkeley accelerator.Program and you know hopefully we'll.We'll get into the program knock on wood.But those are opportunities that we.Would never have ever thought about. you know if again we didn't even.Apply for the you know the boot camp so.Again please please please if you're.Listening just apply just start start.The application and don't leave it too.Late make sure you hit the deadline.Apply.Yeah I love that I love that just apply.And also you're not alone in the space.Like it's it's like there's like I think.Like because we're all here like we're.All together at you know all struggling.We're all like building on furthering.Innovation and it's not easy and so.We're together as a community and also.The Stellar community I'm I'm I'm very.Closely connected with and I think.That's a really great place to get.Started as well and you know like thank.You for for your I just quickly.Quickly wanted to because like one thing.That's from ope and and also like wanted.To hear since like what opportunities.And kind of like in in the investment.Advice like a like what are their .What are the opportunities like and into.Getting investment in this space look.Like and like what is your advice for.For for. future bootcamp participants.Yeah I would I would quickly talk.About that definitely webtree is very.Odds now and .Clearly companies that didn't stop in.This space as long as there's a real.Job to be done for users there are.Investors that are willing to back you.But the challenge with a lot of.Entrepreneurs is figuring out how to.Reach out to those investors how do you.Get coinbase.How do you get cracking how do you get.You know stella.On your captive I would say this is.One of those those ways you can start.Getting to some zombies inwards so yes.I'm following from those words yeah.Click on that body I'm your business on.Webtree apply.For the next bootcamp.Amazing all right well i've kept you.Here long enough longer than you wanted. no but you know thank you so much.To each and every one of.You like I am I am so excited and i.Honestly like I feel very proud.Of what we've accomplished and I'm very.Proud of all of your all of your.Growth I take it personally.It's like i've been part of this process.And I feel like it's kind of like part.Of of your growth so definitely .You know are very excited and also you.Know like going into that we have.Another.Boot camp coming up.I am super excited and I would love.Joseph if you wanted to I'm going to.Share my screen so we actually have some.Fancy slides coming up one second. for joseph to present and then we can.We can start to end the boot camp but.Not and this the discussion of. beautiful growth among these.Companies so joseph take it away.Yeah so you know it's like we've spent.Like the past like our floors talking.About the boots camp and we're we.Have another one coming up it's a.Three-day virtual boot camp .We basically work with you know teams to.Go from you know your idea to a.Prototype in those three days and.The idea is to basically help you like.Think fast and think through like some.Of the problems you face some of the.Challenges you face and then kind of.Come to like.A very simple like you know solution.That you can immediately like start.Playing around with you get to work.With mentors you know whatever. idea you have you you'll have a.Mentor to work with you have the.Exciting.Amazing team from SDF that everyone has.Been talking about so far to also guide.You from anything you know from.Business cases to technical .Challenges and then even past like.The boots camp you have all that support.Still you still have the community .There's going to be a demo day at the.End of the boots camp where you present.You know your prototype and we are you.Know awarding prizes with the SDF for.The foundation from anywhere from you.Know five thousand.To twenty thousand dollars a lot of .Excellent and so and there's of.Course like funto has pointed out.Opportunity for follow-up funding you.Know from a bunch of you know.People including the Stellar the wider.Stellar community itself. so applications are ongoing now you.Should definitely apply. you just go to the link as seen on.This screen and apply we you know.Extended the application date again just.So like more people can get get the.Opportunity so applications close on the.27th so please please please do apply.It's really it's it's like it's .It's it's challenging in many ways .But it's also like very rewarding I i.Can assure you and just like you know.Most of the panelists here said like.It's it's really it's a really great.Opportunity yeah thanks.You did.Awesome well thank you so much everyone.For being here.For sharing your stories for your.Experience and I really look forward to.Your growth as companies please keep me.Updated and stay in the Stellar.Community and the SDF because the stf is.Also upcoming.And definitely has a lot of.Opportunities this round. and yeah I'm excited to hear from you.And definitely to all of future bootcamp.Participating participants watching.Applications are open as joseph.Mentioned and definitely apply.So thank you so much again to everyone.Really grateful for your work and yeah.Let's stay in touch.
