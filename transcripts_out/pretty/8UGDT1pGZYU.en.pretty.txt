Hello everyone and welcome to this.Week's Stellar uh developer me.If you uh were joining us last week you.Would uh have seen orbit lens uh I.Invited him back again because we had so.Much to cover last time that we didn't.Go through everything we we wanted and.Um so obit Lance has actually built.Quite a few uh projects on on stellar.And and one of them uh I'm sure you're.Very familiar with is is still our.Expert so we're going to cover that a.Little bit today uh but first uh uh we.Will hear more about sell broker so yeah.Just please just introduce yourself.Again I know introduced you last week.But for new people on here please go.Ahead and introduce yourself yeah sure.Uh hello everyone.Uh everybody knows me as orbit LS uh I'm.The lead of Stellar expert team um we're.Building different infrastructure.Services on Stellar Network.Um and uh basically today I'd like to.Talk about two of them um Stellar broker.Um yeah so uh Stellar broker is a.Multisource um liquidity swap tool.Um uh and swap rotor for.Stellar um currently uh star star has.Several issues.Uh with fragmented liquidity basically.It leads to worse price for end users uh.Complexity using varas.Protocols um and uh as a result uh it's.Quite difficult to find the best price.Between all of them um because some.Assets are located mainly on classic.Stellar decks and others on new protocol.Imms um but someone executes uh like uh.Large trade if someone trades a scale um.Usually uh such large volume trades are.Vulnerable to um front.Running uh and uh front running actually.Leads to profit loss on.Multiart trades because uh splitting.Each trade into several.Uh smaller trades uh results in a.Situation when somebody can front run.Your Swap and try.To try to be faster and extract The.Profit um and of course there is simply.The question of liquidity because um I.Do remember there was a situation where.People couldn't simply uh.Swap on chain and execute the settlement.Uh for about 100,000 usdc in one trade.Uh with.One uh pass payment trate uh which is.Also not the best user.Experience um so we've been working uh.On the project called U Stellar broker.The with a team from uh Ultra stellar.Uh so uh our original idea was uh to.Implement the solution that will cover.Everything in one um in one uh One Stop.Uh when you uh that will allow you to.Swap uh anything and uh execute your.Transactions on chain classic and.San uh it provides a lot of benefits uh.For and users providing better uh.Exchange rates uh front running.Protection and uh on large trades uh it.Will it will lead to the minimal price.Impact uh non-custodial swaps uh allow.Us to avoid um centralization issues uh.And um.Also um there is no need uh to.Uh retry failed transactions because.Everything will be retried automatically.And even if the swap fails for some.Reasons for example liquidity isn't.There.Anymore um then um the system will.Propose a new um like uh a new trade.Opportunity which will be automatically.Executed um for applications uh that.Want to integrate uh our service uh um.We can offer revenue from user.Swaps um reliable execution flow um.Seamless uh API integration uh which.Means that you just um connected to your.Existing wallet and uh it will work just.Fine and of course it's uh a fling the.Complexity of uh building for two.Different Networks like classic andoran.Which is a bit separated despite that.It's under the.Same uh Stellar network grof uh and.Um like managing multiple connections to.Various uh swap.Protocols um so uh partner um uh which.Uh connects to the system uh can view.The uh Revenue.And um receive payouts for the swaps.Executed by the users uh this kind of.Monetizations benefits and users and.Developers alike because uh users still.Get better rates and uh developers can.Receive like micro bonuses from these uh.Transactions from their user base um the.Integration will be pretty is.Straightforward um we already published.Uh the SDK for it uh and everything you.Will need you'll just need to insert AP.Uh from the website and uh from this.Point um will work will just work and as.A hood it's much more complex than um.Than it looks because.Uh it works with varas uh liquidity.Pools on the uh San uh So currently we.Have uh Aquarius and S SW pools.Connected at our production.Website uh and um we also have two more.Pools in the pipeline which expected um.To come next week it will be um forx Hub.And um it will be uh comment pool uh so.Um our execution engine like finds uh.The best opportunities uh and um first.Of all uh analyzes how the trade can be.Split into many multiple trades uh.Because uh executing several different.Trades instead of one large transaction.Means that there are chances.To to get front run or to just.Uh end up with a failed transaction uh.Because um the market is always a.Dynamic scene it's moving a lot and uh.It's virtually impossible to guess which.Liquidity will be there like in the next.Ledger uh so our engine fls all the.Complexity here uh because uh it.Provides tracking of submitted.Transactions uh it automatically.Connects uh to Sellar core uh fetching.All the required information from there.And uh we basically can basically have.The entire uh graph of all.Available Dex uh orders there uh in.Memory and uh of course uh graph for.Soran.Tools um this is uh um everything is.Located uh in the same place and uh.Provides you a very convenient interface.On top of web soet uh API which is uh.Pretty fast um we made some measurements.And um like average quart response time.Is less than 300 milliseconds uh which.Is very fast and um usually uh like our.Nod receives updates and send it to user.Uh like more than two seconds uh faster.Than uh Horizon because um we uh connect.Directly to Stellar core to receive uh.All the trade information as uh as fast.As possible and uh we can execute uh.Like multiple trade simulation per.Seconds it's tens of thousands it scales.Well.With paralyzation of CPU threats uh so.It means that uh getting more.Simulations uh results in.Better um price quotes for end.Users um so that's basically pretty much.All of it uh I just wanted to say that.Is it is already connected.To uh albida.Wallet and um we're working.To connected to.Stellar and other Ultra Stellar.Applications um if you are interested.Interested to try it uh to play around.Um just let us know and let's talk uh.Any wallet or.Um like uh application that uh works.With user trades U can benefit from this.Optimized transaction execution flow so.Just let us know um probably if if we.Have any questions in the chat I'll be.Happy to.Answer yeah let's uh let's see if.There's any.Any questions in the.Chat uh there was one about public.Facing uh docks I think uh I've shared a.Link to to GitHub um is there anything.Else uh people can go look.At uh yeah it's.Basically um the J Hub link and um.Currently it's the npm package which.Shows uh um the example of connection to.The to the system so that's basically.Everything you need uh to integrate.Great I think it's super interesting.Also and not not just because of the the.The ease of use but also the speed and.And and the fact that you can bring.Bring bring the swap in on on your own.Application and and and decide what what.Fee you're going to charge for for for.Doing the the swap so super interesting.Uh if we don't have any other questions.Uh we can also see if we have some time.At the end of it of it.But uh we can move to Stella expert and.That should be a tool that is known by.Most Stella developers uh it was.Probably the first tool I started using.Uh trying to verify that my transactions.Were going through and just playing.Around with with different um uh.Different uh Quest and.Onboarding games so uh so yeah it's I I.Think it's familiar to most so be.Interesting to hear from the creator of.It yeah uh happy to hear that uh and.Um that's the tool that been around for.Years and I'd like to thank you for all.The users that keep up with us and uh.Despite um sometimes U arise in small.Bugs uh problems with it uh um we're.Trying to keep it.As as functional as it could be and um.Today I'd like to talk a bit about uh.Smart contract stats and uh analyzes of.Smart contract transactions uh because.We've been receiving some questions um.By email and other communication.Channels uh on how it works and I think.It might be interes in not only for.Newcomers but also for season developers.Still uh so first of all uh how can you.Get uh to the transaction and how can.You find something you just need to copy.Paste like account address contract.Address or proit name into the search.Box on the website and will lead you.Directly uh to the the account or.Contract history uh where you can see uh.This list of.Transactions um here you can see uh.Operation type and um like execution.Date um to check a particular uh.Operation you just need to click this.Small uh uh small arrow and uh it will.Present you the expanded view uh I know.It's a bit.Scary uh but no need to panic uh it's.Only from the first glance we'll go.Through it and it will be.Quite there is nothing too complex about.It uh first of all um it shows the C.Tree uh of the top level contract.Invocations uh so we have uh this um.Level contract.That can invoke some other contracts and.Uh provide.[Music].Um.Uh additional um functionality through.This um when you click uh this uh info.Icon uh you can see um the expanded view.Of the contract function itself uh it.Automatically shows you parameters of.The function.Um return.Value.Uh uh like version of the runtime and.SDK and uh if um developers.Left uh Commander then uh you will also.See this um R commands in this.Section um debit uh and credit records.Show um the amount of token.Which have been.Transferred like spent received in the.Trans during the transaction.Execution uh so we can see here for.Example that uh this amount of tokens.Has been debited from this account and.Credited to another.Account.Um contracts uh can save the data on The.Ledger with uh different storage.Retention options so like in.Data is uh basically the data that is.Inside the contract itself uh and every.Time.Um like the environment loads the.Instance of the contract it also loads.All the data attached to it resistent.Entries stored.Separately uh and temporary items uh can.Be used to uh store some cheap temporary.Information that can be easily.Evicted.Um additionally uh some contracts May.Emit events.Uh which is U this mechanism is intended.For publishing um data for.Indexers um the event consist of the.Header of the event and some arbitrary.Contract.Data um so uh these uh events can be.Further analyzed by indexers by.Rpcs or some other.Applications um and at the bottom uh of.The invocation you can see um what.Happens uh on the system level so like.Uh input output uh memory usage.Ledger entries written and U read and um.Many other.Very low um very low level statistics.And uh additional of course here you can.See also fees charged for these.Particular.Transactions uh which can be analyzed.Further um now if we uh uh scale up a.Bit um we have a contract view uh if you.Just click uh.The address of any contract you will end.Up here uh at the contract View and it.Will display like the general summary of.The contract and uh current contract.Balances uh this is I think uh.Is is a liquidity pool contract that.Holds uh uh xlm and you DC.Assets um we have here the information.Who created the.Contract uh and um there was some hash.Of the contract also it was pretty.Active contract that made a lot of.Transfers uh data storage here uh shows.The number of uh entries uh that have.Been.Written and stored on.Chain um below it um you can see the.Detailed breakdown of.Um all the ocation stats here you can.Play around with functions uh selecting.Some spe specific function uh you want.To.Analyze choose the period uh for starts.Um and.Um analyze some specific uh statistics.So for example if you want to know why.Um these grew up after the recent.Deployment you can see it here you can.See how this value change over time and.Um how to analyze them uh history tab we.Already talked about iter and the.Interface tab uh contains um the list of.Public experts from the contract it's.Like functions uh uh all the structures.Enams everything that is declared in the.Contract and publicly available all the.Contract interfaces here um and it's.Quite handy tool if you want to build a.Transaction using CLI or any other Tool.Uh or you just maybe want to.Uh play around Vis it uh and uh check uh.What's inside the contract uh here is.Also the link uh for downloading the.Contract uh contract was and.Um here is the next interface uh which.Shows the the list of stor data entries.Uh for some particular.Contract um here we can see uh the that.Uh the entry is persistent or not it's.Uh TTL value so time to leave um when.The last it was updated uh and uh.Balances attached to these.Values.Um and uh one more thing that I'd like.To cover uh probably not everybody knows.About this functionality but uh we have.Uh protocol versions history uh in the.Interface uh it's under the main menu.Section and um in the protocols history.You can see uh changes uh that were.Applied to.The to The Ledger uh during prodal.Upgrades and of also during suran.Runtime F changes.Updates um it's uh the lowlevel view of.What happens uh when validators vote for.Increas in limits and uh basically here.You can easily check and say what are.Our current limits uh and uh what was.The last update uh and what changed.During uh I have a lot of more to cover.But let's wrap at it because I think.That uh we have already few minutes left.So if you have any question questions.Let.St yeah thank you for for the run.Through uh I I.Definitely have learned a little bit I'm.I'm still a pretty basic user but but I.Think it's it's it's a very it's it's.Very practical to to be able to see.Something like the the protocol upgrades.Um I think there's a lot of good.Features for for debuging and for for.Evaluating your your contracts do we.Have any questions from.From the comments I don't see.That um I don't think so but uh yeah.Let's.See there's one.Here.Soron is this uh in the context of.Stellar.Expert yes so um we already show uh.The transaction history and trades and.Everything for classic uh.Operations uh but um trades history and.Some specific for example liquidity pool.Stats or um for example blend pool stats.They are still unavailable because uh.Like right now we still have uh the.Process of um standardization in.Progress uh so right now um the.Committee is talking about uh moving to.Some more.Uh uh more obvious standards for.Publishing for example events uh what.Will be the format of these events and.How they can be further analyzed by.Downstream systems to produce all the.DAT um it it should be available soon in.Star expert all the price history all.The stats from surban.Contrition okay great I think that's all.We have time for today thank you for for.Joining again thank you for inviting.This was really interesting I I love to.See some of the community build tools uh.It's it's a it was a pleasure to to chat.To you again and um yeah if anyone else.Has some some questions I'm sure they.Can they can reach out to you on on.Discord but um yeah definitely for.Joining and thank you all this thank you.Okay thank you bye bye.
