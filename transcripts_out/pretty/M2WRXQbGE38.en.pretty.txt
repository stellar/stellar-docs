Does that mean we're actually live it's.Likely.Okay.Would you like to take it away for us no.Dude you go ahead and intro.All right welcome welcome welcome.Everyone. it is fantastic to be live once again. with my with my good buddy.Colton we're to be talking about.Stellar community funding .We've we've we've talked about.This in the past.But it was kind of looking forward to.A future date when it would actually.All go live and lo and behold that day.Has finally arrived.And so scf 2.0 after many many months of.Planning.And building the ecosystem team is.Finally ready to release.Scf 2.0 and that's what.We're going to be talking about today.This is engineering talk so we will get.Into the weeds a little bit on some of.The technical decisions.And implementations that we have in this.New version of the Stellar community.Fund but it's also going to be.A bit longer than normal engineering.Talks so normally in journey talks for.Like 15.20 minutes this will probably go a.Little bit longer than that to make sure.We do.Justice to all the updates and have all.The information available to those who.Are interested.In this update to the Stellar community.Fund.So i've got my my fancy slide deck.Open here and we're just gonna start.Walking.Straight through this I think it's worth.Taking a little bit of a look back. as well as the the look ahead to kind.Of see where we've come from.And to understand a little bit better.Why as well as where we're going. so to kind of inform our.Discussion here let's look at our.Mandate so the Stellar has a mandate.And the SDF is aiming to follow that.This is something we make public.And if you just type in google Stellar.Mandate you can find.This particular quote somewhere buried.In there with all the other. missions and visions and mandates.That we follow at the sdf.When building Stellar the Stellar.Community fund so one of our allocations.Of lumens.Is dedicated towards the Stellar.Community fund this this community.Funding initiative.And it gives the broader Stellar.Community the opportunity to vote.On which projects deserve excellent.Grants this is a very unique.Fund in that it is the only one that.Really gives.The the greater community a direct.Opportunity to impact.The allocation of xlm grants the SDF has.A pool of lumens that it has mandated. to give out in certain scenarios and.To certain entities to accomplish.Specific goals and tasks.And one of those is this pool of lumens. 12 million.Lumens a year that we give out via.The community so the community can take.Part in allocating those and that's kind.Of what we're doing with this big update.Is to get closer and continue to iterate.On what we've done in the past.To align with this goal this mandate.As well as. getting closer so .We've we've been close to it but as the.As the ecosystem matures we need to.Continuously update.And make sure that we're aligned with.Our with our mandate.So a little bit of history the.Stellar community fund I would.Lump it together with the Stellar build.Challenge so way back in june.2016 the SDF released.A project called the Stellar build.Challenge.And the first place winner.Of that they had a different.Categories and different you know.First place second. first second and third place and.First place was going to win 55 million.Limbs the price of lumens back at that.Time was actually less than a penny so.We've.We've come a long way since june 2016. entries in that very first Stellar.Bill challenge included.Galactic talk and lobster amongst others.So.Two projects that we at least I know i.Use just about every single day. and then we move all the way through.September 2018 to the last.Spc so the Stellar build challenge was.Shut down at the number seven and then.Shortly after that zach who hopefully.A lot of you.In this community know the hero really.Of the sbc kind of took over. ownership of that and then.Transitioned or.As the spc went out he brought back in.What we call the Stellar community fund.Which was really starting to align more.Closely with the.Community vision of the .The mandate to have the community giving.Away these lumens are allocating where. those 12 million lumens should go.And so that was carried out by by zach.He built it.Designed it we've been running that for.A little over a year now. five different rounds and now we find.Ourselves here august 2020.With the scf 2.0 and .These these different sbcs and scf like.They were all. good and they all worked well in.Their in their time there may have been.Things that would.Could have been improved or changed .But we did that right so as.As things can be better we make efforts.To improve them.And that's really what the scf 2.0 is.Trying to do and it's it's making maybe.A little bit bigger stab.An improvement something maybe akin to.What zack did when he.Initially created or invented the.Scf the original scf we're kind of.Taking a big step at that so rather than.Just adjusting some rules.We're actually restructuring it in a.Pretty significant way taking the best.Of both the spc and the scf into a into.A new fund.Which we hope will provide.A fantastic funding mechanism for a long.Time yet.Before you keep going I do think it's.Worth highlighting .The original the very first round of scf.Do you remember how voting.Took place I do I do yes the the very.Original round of sef we did a vote.In a reddit thread where people just.Like typed in their .Their preferences or their votes and we.Had to like hand count them.Zack hand counted them and I hand.Counted them and then a community member.Came up with a script to help count them.So we were like.Manually counting comments in a reddit.Thread so even scf 1.0 has come a long.Way since the very first iteration.Yeah that's exactly right we're always.Trying to iterate and a lot of it again.Like it's not.That something was bad and we're trying.To make it good it's that.As the ecosystem matures we have more.Members more participants.And interest grows necessarily the.Fund itself needs to change to better.Suit and host the kind of growth that.We're seeing.A little bit of a fun fact the spc and.Scf is actually where I came from.My intro to Stellar came from the sbc.With entries like popcorn color glyph.And Stellar ql.And then in the scf I had Stellar.Auth.And I think so one of the one of the big.Focuses for me is i've thought about the.Redesign of an scf and like where can we.Actually make.Important and meaningful changes .Is to like the the funding obviously a.Big focus of that.Is the funding right the actual money.That's handed out. but Stellar community funding is as.Much about people and relationships as.It is about giving money away if you.Talk to.Winners or or participants that really.Took the scf.Or sbcs seriously a large.Majority will say that the relationships.And feedback.That they received were actually more.Valuable than the money that they.Received the money is obviously helpful.And that's why you're here.But a huge part of participating in this.Is also the relationships and the actual.Community aspect.So sure it's funding yes it's Stellar.But the community aspect is more than.Just.The world can vote it's also the world.Can participate.Anybody who's interested in still.Anybody wants to talk about .Fintech and finance and moving money.Around and transferring value anybody.That that's interesting to they can.Participate and talk and give feedback.And.Find projects that are interesting to.Them and find their place.To communicate whether that's competing.Actually submitting entries.Writing documents you know submitting.With.Events or documentation or actual.Projects.Or just combing through entries and.Seeing which ones you feel like are.Valuable.And interesting and something that.Should actually receive funding.It's a it's a community fund and being.Able to focus a bit more.On that aspect is something that was.Really important to me in the redesign.Of the sef is yes the funds are great.And we need to make sure we do the best.Job possible of allocating those.Appropriately.But a community is a huge part of this.So making sure the people are still at.The center.So if I were to summarize kind of the.Driving.Principle behind the redesign for me.It's the right resources in the right.Hands at the right time.Resources being funds as well as.Feedback.Right hands being making sure that we're.Getting these to actual projects.Making sure the filtering process by.Which entries come in and then get.Funding that that flow.Makes sense that nobody's being.Overworked.In the review process that there's this.Little angst and struggle. I mean it is a competition so you're.Going to have.Some of that but combing down on the.Unnecessary pieces of that.And then at the right time so making.Sure that our our funds.Reflect the amount of money for.The time that the project has spent. on it and the amount of effort that's.Gone in. so this to me is really kind of the.Driving force behind. the theme of the redesign.And so with that those who aren't.Familiar with.The scf currently it's it's a single.That happens four times a year where.Three million lumens are given out. split between eight different.In this new scf 2.0 there are two funds.There's a lab fund and a seed fund the.Lab fund being.The smaller experimental kind of open.Source focused.Documentation events the idea of like.Seo market presence getting the.The word out there as well as real.World's real world stress tests so.Building things that maybe aren't.Necessarily perfect for the Stellar use.Case as it stands but might help stress.Test the network. that would be our lab fund and that.Is.500 000 lumens given out four times per.Year.Split between about 12 different.Projects and then we have the seed fund.The seed fund is for bigger projects.This is to help viable.Innovative first-mover businesses and.Utilities.To get started on Stellar these are.Projects that we hope will still be.Around.In the prize pool for that is five.Million lumens split between three to.Five projects and that.Seed fund will happen twice a year.And so by splitting these funds I mean.What we see right now in the scf is.These two different kinds of entries.Larger projects as well as like.Hackathon type projects.And they're both very valuable to the.Ecosystem both can generate a lot of.Excitement.The problem is right now they both.Receive about the same amount of funding.Where a lab fund a hackathon project.Really it's it's.Worth doing it it's worth competing for.A much lower price.And so you'd still be willing to.Participate whereas in the seed fund if.You don't get enough money if you don't.Get enough funding it's really hard to.Keep that project.Alive and keep it going and so by.Splitting this up into two very specific.And defined funds.Hopefully you'll know better which one.Your project fits into.And then you receive the funding that's.Appropriate more appropriate for.The kind of project that you have I will.Say that this.Necessarily means that we also have to.Introduce.A brand new component really two.Components but maybe one's more of an.Update but.We need to introduce the idea of panel.Of judges as well as an update to our.Voting mechanism.So we have a voting mechanism right now. and we.Technically have a panel of judges but.Right now it's the whole wide world.It's the whole community and .So let's say we have 20 entries that.Come in how do we narrow that down to.Like a final entry say with 300 entries.Come in how do we narrow that down.To some sort of manageable list that a.Final. voting round can happen where a.Reasonable.Amount of funds can be allocated and.There's not a lot of voter fatigue. with having to comb through 300.Different entries the problem right now.Is that the community the same community.Technically will will vote in both of.Those.So you're voting once you're picking all.The projects you're combing through lots.Of entries.And then you kind of have to do a whole.Thing over again in the final round.So you narrow down and then you you have.A final vote to allocate funds.In this new scf 2.0 we're removing or.Really.Splitting that so there'll be a panel of.Judges which is a very select group.Of community members who have .Dedicated a lot of time and effort and.Energy.Into Stellar building on Stellar so they.Maybe have won spcs or scfs in the past.They might be part of the infrastructure.Grants or the enterprise fund people.That are really core.To the Stellar ecosystem as well as a.Few sdf.Employees like myself colton zack anka.And others and then those the the the.Role of the panel of judges will be to.Filter through all of the entries that.Come in for either the seed of the lab.And narrow that down to a final list.That they feel is.Of highest quality and then those.Finalists will make it into the.Community.Round voting which is this flaggable.Quadratic voting.And with this we're really trying to add.Velocity or add .Sentiment to a community vote right now.It's very one-sided.Where or at least it's very static.Where when you have a vote you can say i.Like this project this project.And this project there's no intensity.You can't say I really like this project.Or.I kind of like this project or even i.Really don't like this project.All of those sentiments are quite.Important to ensuring that.The actual amount of lumens the the.Voting power. allows the sentiment or that that.Curve.To most closely represent the actual.Community sentiment that's.Participating in that voting round and.We're hoping that through this flaggable.Quadratic voting that we can achieve.That. this is kind of more of the the.Technical aspect of this talk and.Colton is actually he's the one who sold.Me on the idea of quadratic voting and.I'm going to hand it over to him for a.Little bit I'm going to bring up a.Screen here with a demo.Of quadratic voting and then just.Kind of let him.Explain where we stumbled upon quadratic.Voting.How we've implemented ourselves and why.We think it's worth trying.Yeah so we kind of came across quadratic.Voting when. looking at how the sort of ethereum.Ecosystem handles funding. in particular a project on ethereum.Called git coin. they have this sort of funding.Mechanism called quadratic funding.Which is another flavor of sort of.Quadratic voting where.Basically they allow a group of people.To make donations to a project.You basically take this square root.Of each project or each donation you.Like add them all together and then you.Square that and you kind of get a.Matching number for that poll of.Donations.And so we kind of borrowed from that.Idea.And took the sort of original iteration.Of quadratic funding.Which is ultimately quadratic voting and.Like tyler was saying.This idea of quadratic voting allows you.To.Specify intensity towards your.Preference of a boat.So in a traditional voting system where.It's just one person one boat.You have this problem where when you're.Voting for multiple projects.You can't express how positively or.Negatively.You feel about that project and we.Thought you know what since we're doing.This.Community boat we want experts in the.Community to be able to double down on.Projects they really like.We want people who are avid users of a.Project to double down on projects they.Really like.But we also want people to be able to.Give super valid opinions.About projects they really like so if.They think something is over performing.Then they can also downvote.That project which I think tyler will.Show in this demo here so i'll kind of.Let you show how it works and it's much.More intuitive once.You kind of start clicking around and.Get a feel for how the voting mechanism.Works. but we we have a better explainer on.The website and we also.Have some resources we can provide for.Anybody who wants to.Sort of hear it out or learn more about.It yeah absolutely.Yep and I think it's worth mentioning.Too like this is an experiment.In a sense because I mean colin.Remind you every single time that. like we're trying this I think it's.Gonna be fantastic we'll see. that's the beauty of the scf is we.Get to iterate and make improvements and.Really see what works and what doesn't.But to kind of go through a demo here .Ultimately there's a prize pool right so.You've got an amount of money.That's being allocated by percentage.Vote so.As votes are given for or against.A project their percentage compared to.Other projects changes and that.Necessarily means the amount of prize.Money.That they're winning changes and this is.Something that we really want to.Highlight.In the new voting design which by the.Way this is a demo this isn't.Actually what the voting site looks like.But this is a this is a good demo very.Clean.And I hope it will help kind of allow.You to play around with what you have.In quadratic voting but as you have.Like let's say we really like this.Unbranded wooden soap project and we.Would like to give it some.Some votes we would like to say I like.This project if you give it a single.Vote.You'll see right here by that by adding.A single vote you're going to give it.27.69.And so that is going to increase this.Number by that 27.To get us to this number you've added.27.69 but that 2769.Has to come from somewhere and it came.From.All these other projects 227 from here.30 bucks and and two pennies from.This project and.Like that's how you can kind of upvote.Download you can.Sort of take money from other projects.And allocate it here but it's important.To understand.That that's what's happening as you.Start to add votes to a project.Really you start with this number of.Credits and then as you vote.Those credits are burnt and the.Quadratic the the scaling part of this.Happens is you start to upvote or.Downvote a particular project multiple.Times so if I click this again.It's going to be two votes but two times.Two is four.And so it's going to burn four.Credits so we voted twice but we've.Burned.Four credits so what that means is as.You start to click on this project more.We voted five times but five times five.Is 25 so we've burned.25 credits voting for this project five.Times.If we start voting for other projects.Let's say I also really like this.Refined cotton shoes.I'm a big cotton shoes fan myself we.Don't want this project to lose its.27.76 so we need to make sure we get.That back up.And so we're going to start to add a.Little bit of money back to this project.So that this one comes up.And so we've added 661 to this and 24.Now we haven't necessarily like.It's still coming from the same pool.It's just allocating from all these.Other ones taking money from those.And putting it back in there but you can.In real time start to see how your votes.Directly affect the outcome as it stands.When you're voting.And you have these credits that you can.Start to burn but instead of it just.Being static.Five and two it scales quadratically.So that you can't overpower.A vote in a particular direction.And you allow that that sentiment.Again.To to translate much more closely to.The the way that people would actually.Vote and actually share their sentiment.If you were to.Poll a community another thing that i.Think is really important again this is.This is static this is standard.Quadratic.Voting but you might start to see a.Problem here and this is.This starts to get into a little bit of.The issues that you find when you.Are giving away money in the public is.Manipulation.And there's lots you can do . when you're registering accounts like.You make sure you have accounts.That are voting are using a system.That's not free to create like .In our system we're using SMS.Verification so you have to have a phone.That can receive SMS messages to be able.To vote in the past we've used key base.Which has.Some ability to to find who's voting to.Decide like to make a decision on.Whether or not. you believe them to be a legitimate.Individual human being that doesn't have.A lot of copies of themselves in the.Database.That's voting but manipulation out in.The public is is quite difficult.To do in the sbc right we just had a.Panel of judges that would.Pick the projects who we were we were.Sure were we knew who they were.But when you open that up and you say.Well let's let's open this up to a real.Community vote it's great until the word.Starts to get out and you start to see.Wow we can actually win a lot of money.And the manipulation.Becomes much more worth it.And if you don't increase the friction.If you don't add a layer of friction.Then that manipulation will just start.To scale and that's really what we've.Seen in the past particularly two scfs.Four and five and really really strongly.In five you can go back and read our.Post-mortem on.Scf5 where voter manipulation just kind.Of blew out of control and we knew this.Was going to be the case because we were.Using key base and it's free.To create a key base account and so once.People start to get the word.Like i'll just create a free key base.Account start using that to vote.And so you have to find ways to.Counteract that and so circling all the.Way back.To quadratic voting it's not enough to.Just allow.Kind of sentiment changes you also need.The ability to sort of flag things so if.A particular project is.Way over performing or underperforming.What you believe they should.Like let's say this project down here .Well let's say a refined granite chair.Just it's taking off we like this is.They their website doesn't even work why.Is this project doing so well.You might be tempted to use all of your.Credits right 10 times 10 is 100 credits.To to burn and try and get them down. from where you believe you know they.Shouldn't get this much like they don't.Have anything why are they getting this.Much.But the problem is by downvoting them 10.Times you haven't really affected the.Vote at all you've just tried to.Counteract. the bad acting that they that you.Believe that they're doing.And so a better alternative is adding.Idea of flaggable quadratic voting where.Rather than using all your credits to.Counteract a bad actor.You just put a sentiment so I want it to.Go up I feel like this is.Under performing like somebody's.Attacking this project and down voting.It and they shouldn't.And then I'm going to use 16 credits in.This case.To add a flag that basically just says.Hey moderators can you please take a.Look at this something's fishy.And you could also go in the other.Direction too you say this is way over.Performing.I think somebody needs to take a look at.This the the panel needs to take another.Look something's fishy with this.But now you've only burned a few credits.To make that flag and you still have in.This case 83 left.To just carry about your normal business.Of upvoting.And down voting other projects as you.Please so rather than having to spend.All of your credits.On counteracting bad actors you can just.Flag it.The panel will take a look at it and you.Don't have to worry about it anymore you.Can carry on with your vote I think.That's really important. in the iteration process of figuring.Out the best way to have an open.Fund where you are giving away a.Relative.Relatively large amount of money and.Manipulation is going to happen it's.Just how do we counteract that.And how do we allow the community to.Take part in fighting against that so.That the fund is. the easiest the lowest friction but.Also incredibly fair.And well run and as time goes on we'll.See how this works.And we'll make changes as necessary yeah.And we have a we have a couple questions.Coming in about this so. one of them is can you recast votes.And the answer is.Yes until you like submit your final.Vote right so you'll be able to kind of.Dynamically adjust your votes.However you want throughout the system.So say say you upvoted. one or two projects and you decide to.Change your mind.Before you submit you'll be able to do.That like it's not set in stone until.Yeah it's not click submit.That's a really good question it's.Something i've kind of gone back and.Forth on could you like update votes. so there's two kind of problems that.I see with that one if you're able to.Like update votes.Essentially you would make a change and.Then that changes public to anybody else.That's also voting.And in the case of a bad actor you could.Create a bunch of fake accounts.Really skew up the vote and then kind of.Reactively go back and change all of.That you know like remove all your votes.Or update your votes in a particular.Direction and.Now it's not all that helpful and so. I don't think being able to update.Your votes is all that .Necessary I think would probably do more.Damage than it would do.Good the issue then obviously is well if.I if I'm allocating my funds.But then the project changes.Significantly it gets a lot more votes.Than it did when I voted then maybe i.Should just wait to vote to the very.Last minute.And I think we'll have to see that.Because I don't really want people to.Wait until the very last minute to vote. but I don't I don't think in general.That's going to happen it's just.Something we'll have to evaluate and i.Feel like.The way we've done it now is probably.The best way to start and then we just.Have to see what happens.Through the first like lab and seed.Funds and then if adjustments are.Needed either on updates or like the.Frequency that you can make updates or.I don't know there's different.Parameters you can add that might .Help with some of the pros and cons.Of either one of those options yeah i.Don't think retro.Like going back and changing a vote.After you submit it will.Really ever be like a viable option but.You'll be able to do it before you.Submit the other one.Are there any features built in to.Prevent flag spamming. not I don't think not in the ui or.Anything like that there's nothing to.Prevent it like.Ultimately if people flag spam that.Doesn't guarantee that a project will be.Disqualified or anything like that it's.More of just like a.Hey you guys really need to take a look.At this so if there's one particular.Like say one project.Gets one flag response it probably.Won't get looked at but if it gets 20.Flag responses then it'll probably end.Up getting looked at. and if somebody is just flag spamming.And there's no obvious manipulation.Taking place and they just.Won't be disqualified or anything like.That yeah and that's.A it's a really good question and i.Think .Hopefully a good answer to that is that.Flags don't actually affect.The prize allocation it's just a flag.You have to spend.Credits to flag things so you can't flag.Every project you can only flag.Up to one less than half or I think.Maybe one more than half.Of the projects when when you're.Actually making a flag but flags don't.Count.For a positive or a negative when it.Comes to the final prize allocation it's.Just like hey take a look at this.This this one vote will count towards a.Positive and so you can add more.Positivity if you're like well.If this doesn't get improved I want to.Make sure that they get something. like you could do that but at the end.Of the day the flag doesn't really do.Anything as far as changing the vote.Like nobody else is going to see.Projects that have been flagged it's.Just a note to the panels to the jud the.Panel of judges for that round.That something might be fishy and.Somebody needs to take a look at this.This entry.All right let me double check make sure.I did not miss anything.Okay I think we're good on like the.Specifics of.Quadratic voting the other did we did we.Touch on why we think like linear.Distribution is not ideal.And we did not call them would you like.To .Wax eloquently sure let's talk about.Linear distributions.So one of the big pro you know and we.Call it a problem but it's easy to say.This in hindsight but one of the big.Problems we identified with.The current model of scf is that the.Distribution of funds is really linear.Right like if you look at it on a graph.It looks like something like that.But the big problem with that is that.The. complexity of any given project in a.Round can be very different so like.A project that gets second place and one.Round could be like a full-on business.And the project that gets second place.And another round could be like a.Hackathon project and if you have this.Linear distribution of funds.That means those two projects got the.Same amount of money.Just based on which round they submitted.This isn't ideal.Obviously because those projects are of.Varying quality they need different.Amounts of money to function properly.They need different amounts of money to.Scale up properly.So we had a the reason we consider.Quadratic voting is that.The community can kind of decide okay.Look this.Project is it needs way more money than.The project next to it in the.Competition.And so we can allocate our votes.Proportionately and get them more money.In the current voting system you just.Literally can't do that. so we wanted it to be more dynamic.Somebody just asked another question.Sorry that distracted me anyway so we.Wanted the allocation of funds to be.More dynamic.To be able to fit the needs of the.Projects who were submitted and allow.The community to.Fit those needs with their vote as well.Yeah yep absolutely and I think like a.Linear when you don't have.A quadratic system or you don't have a.Panel of judges you have to be really.Careful.With how you allow votes to be allocated.Because it would be really easy for.The wrong project to receive .A ridiculous amount of money through.Manipulation and so you kind of.Counteract some of the.Manipulation by not allowing a project.To vote for themselves three times.Or only and so you enforce like okay and.In the final round for example right now.You have to vote for three projects you.Can't just vote for yourself. and that's that's really important.Because if there is a project that's.Kind of running away with the vote. they still have to allocate two of.Their percentages they're 33.66 70 percent of their vote has to go to.Other projects. but that necessarily means that the.The the.Projection of votes or the distribution.Of votes is going to be linear because.You don't have a lot of influence over.A really strong opinion in one way or.Another and so once you have.Both a panel of judges that ensures the.Finalists list is always high quality.You have quadratic voting which allows.Individuals to very strongly.Point in the direction that they want.But also if you vote.Exclusively on one project you only have.10 votes.Whereas if you spread it out you have up.To like 100 votes like.You can really spread that out your.Influence out over a large range.Of projects if you want to and so the.Ability to manipulate even without the.Other.Features that we have built in through.Sms messaging and .Kind of the the improvement that that is.Over key base.That's already better and so once you.Add on top of it the SMS verification. hopefully again the the theory is.That we'll have a much.More dynamic voting mechan.Mechanism that will better reflect the.Actual entries in a particular round.Rather than just kind of always being.Linear.Yeah for sure and like even you know if.It even if it ends up being a problem.Where like.We have first place always wait out.Performing or something like that you.Can always tweet quadratic voting like.For example you can remove. one of the you can reduce the credits.From 100 to 99.And all of a sudden in order to vote.That requires you to distribute your.Tokens.Across I think three projects or.Something like that to use all of them.So you can make small tweets like that.And it can have you know big effects so.If there comes a time where.It feels like we need to make changes.Like that we can easily do so.One of the projects that came up was.Or not projects questions.Was will we be able to engage judges.Ahead of time to address any concerns.They may have regarding technical.Feasibility or other issues.Yeah fantastic question absolutely you.Will the panel of judges is probably.Going to be about 10. individuals per round and there'll be.A lot of.Discussion back and forth on on the.Projects that they feel.The panel feels our potential for.Finalists.And there's still some like the panels.Like we're going to have to figure it.Out how how the judging actually works.Like.If you only have to go through 20.Projects 30 projects that's pretty.That's relatively easy to do and to.Give a bit more.Hands-on experience for every single.Entry whereas if you have 500.Which I think our last spc had something.Like 500 entries. not everybody's going to be able to.Be reached out to.And so there'll be a little bit of back.And forth and you need to make sure that.Your entry.Is really strong and really solid and.You don't feel like there should be a.Whole lot of back and forth because what.You've put out there is really good. you need to put your best foot.Forward and really make an impression.And make it a proven and not assume that.If I put something out there that's kind.Of half-hearted.That it still has a chance because.Someone will reach out to me that may or.May not be the case.So I would always encourage entrants to.Really put maximum effort.That they that they feel is worth it for.Them into their entry.And then as the panelists go through the.Entries.Hopefully you get someone to to kind of.Adopt your project and start reaching.Out and.Kind of provide some of that.Relationship and that feedback and if.Not. the community is always available.Like there's there's a ton of people out.There that are never going to be on a.Panel but that can still provide.Feedback for your project and.Help you improve it so that when it does.Come time for the next lab fund or.A seed fund your project's even stronger.But it will be important to kind of.Serve yourself.First in this in this competition.Particularly as we start we continue to.Grow and. have more entries to not assume.Too much.Of our panelists but to make it as easy.As possible for them to recognize.That your project is insane that it's.Amazing and it deserves.A little bit of a longer look in the.Same way that you would make a pitch to.Any other fund any other funding.Opportunity.Really make that strong sort of elevator.Pitch if you will.Yeah and somebody asks if the quadratic.Voting demo is on.Github or if it'll be on github later. it might be I can make sure we put.That up .For sure yeah it would be good for other.People to look through that you can.Obviously play around with it at.Fqv.versal.app. but i'll make sure I have the code.Available for. for review and.Tweaking sweet and then somebody said if.A project is very ambitious.Its product has to be way more advanced.Than others because people can sell the.Idea that they need way more funds when.This is not true yeah of course I mean.That's kind of the nature of like a.Competition right you have to sell.People on.On your vision and what you're building.Anyway and if somebody does.A better job of selling the fact that.They might need more funding or.Something like that.And the community supports it and wants.To get behind it that's.You know more power to those people.Right like they've they've done a good.Job of pitching the community.And it can also be the case that a.Project very obviously.Needs way more funding but they do a way.Worse job of pitching their idea to the.And they won't receive as much funding.That's kind of like an inherent. feature of competitions rather than.Like some problem that you can kind of.Easily solve outside of having.You know one entity pick where money.Should go yeah.Yeah I think it's worth speaking to that.A little bit particularly as somebody.Myself who competed in both the spc.And the scf it's not it's not crazy easy.It isn't easy to win these competitions.But.If you treat it serious and you treat it.For the fun that it is.And really put your heart and soul not.Just into the code and into your idea.And kind of. I don't know attaching yourself.Personally to your project but kind of.Saying that this is a.Community effort I want to make.Something that's valuable to other.People.That necessarily like if that's a.Priority of yours to make something that.Other people care about.Necessarily that means you're going to.Promote it you're going to talk about it.Because you want people to use it you.Want it to improve their lives.If you're just making something that's.Fun and you don't really care if people.Interact with it or benefit from it.Again that might be a really good lab.Fund entry but you're still going to.Need to market you're still going to.Need to get people's eyeballs on it and.Some buzz around it and that can be a.Little bit.Challenging I think as developers .To like think about how do I promote.This thing I just want to code it and i.Understand that challenge but it also.Gives you that opportunity to kind of.Get a leg up on on other developers or.Entrants that aren't willing to do that. and.Like we want projects to win not just.Because they did a good job but because.Other people are going to use.The the project that they're building.And see the value and get it if you.Build something amazing but nobody knows.About it that's that's kind of sad.That's unfortunate and i'd like i'd like.To see amazing projects.Get visibility and I want to help with.That as well as as you taking that.Effort.And and putting it out there but it's.It's both of us the the.Actual fund itself putting facetime on.To the projects that are.Highest quality and putting the most.Effort in as well as you really selling.That and saying that i've built.Something and it's amazing.And here's why doing blog posts and.Putting a little bit of.Good care into the design the actual ui.And ux.Thinking through what would it be like.To judge this project and how can i.Improve that making sure that they're a.Good. demo username and password available.If your.If your project has a login barrier.Like simple things like that a video.Explainer showcasing your team putting.Your face on a camera like.Those things can really go a long way .And that's not.It's not like the scf's the only fund.That's like that anywhere you try and.Get funding anywhere that it's a.That's going to be true that those who.Put the most effort into.Communicating and selling their project.They're going to do the best. particularly if they've spent a lot.Of time actually making their project.Good right like you don't want to.Promote something that really isn't all.That great but if you have both of those.Things together.Like maybe skip a round of lab fund and.Really dive into. having both of those pieces a really.Good project.And really good marketing and really.Good blog posts and and.Combining both of those things together.To really give yourself the best chance.At succeeding in the lab or or in.The seed fund.Yeah and it is worth noting like I think.Going forward.In different rounds of seo if we're.Going to do a really we're going to try.To do a really good job of like.Highlighting what made projects.Successful in any given round.That way like everybody can kind of.Learn from each other and there's not.This like black hole of you trying to.Figure out. you know what do I need to do to to.Perform well.In scf I think we're going to try to do.A way better job of of getting that.Information out there so everybody can.Kind of learn from each other and it.Makes the competition. you know better for everybody yeah.Absolutely yep some blog posts on how to.Place well in the scf you know what what.Are judges looking for like.Again adding the relationship piece and.Putting a little bit more focus on that.I think treating the scf.Like it's a product like it's a thing.Rather than kind of just a.Something that's also going on somewhere.Out there you know good luck. as it's kind of been a little bit in.The past trying to focus a little bit.More on this is really important.To the ecosystem and building up the.Resources.And the marketing and the the.Communication relationship aspect of the.Seller community fund so that it.Just provides that really strong.Opportunity to get funding.And recognition for the work that you're.Doing instead and really incentivize you. to want to build on seller and to.Give you the right route to succeed.Whether that's through funding.Relationships building you know going.From the lab fund to the seed fund from.Something fun to a business like.There's a lot of different tracks that.Individuals can take .But really making like highlighting.Those and helping people along.And including the community in that so.It's not just me and colton trying to do.Everything. but that the community knows where.They can get involved and.Where the gaps are that need to be.Filled so that this thing can really.Take on.A much stronger community sense.And finding where that where that is.Where that's needed and where it can.Best fit. as the fund again continues to mature.As it has been.Sweet I think we're caught up on.Questions so we can move on in the.Presentation.All right super duper not not too much.Further to go appreciate everyone for.The for the fantastic questions these.Are obviously two very important.Components that really highlight.The difference between what we have.Right now and.What we're launching today so.Kind of in conclusion two key takeaways. the SDF funds projects. and so if you've got a contact you.Know clients.Or yourself who's looking .Either maybe isn't a good fit for the.Infrastructure again or the enterprise.Fund which we also have but are.Strictly SDF managed refer them to the.Scf you know point people towards us.Get yourself involved whether as a judge.Or as a participant.With a split between the lab and the.Seed funds we have a strong funding.Avenue for more mature and serious.Entrepreneurs.While still providing a profitable.Playground for new.And curious developers so we've really.Got that platform that's going to.Support.A much wider ecosystem in a much more.Effective way. so we fund projects but you can also.Help and I cannot emphasize this.Enough.Like we we get you know this is a.Stellar fund we get that it's a fund.But let's let's let's really take.Some time thinking about the community.Aspect of this to get involved. join the seller dot community fund.Key base group. I would highly encourage that that if.This is something that's interesting to.You whether the design of the fund.Itself the.The participation as a voter or your got.Questions about the entry.How to enter or you know anything.Related this is kind of where the.Community is going to talk.About about this other community fund.So make sure you jump into.Stellar.community.Fund and then also make sure you.Participate.In community discussion whether that's.On key base or in different.Discussion groups as well as the voting.Phases so when voting comes out.Participate get involved you know spend.Those credits.Put them where you think they should go.And then also help to share the story of.Solid entries.As well as referring those potential.Participants so .As you have social media accounts and.You want to get the word out of projects.That you care about that you I mean if.You've put credits toward them.Share their story like get them out.There so that they can not just receive.Funding from.From the SDF but they can actually .Get involvement from the greater.Community maybe they come back and.Participate in another lab fund with new.Improvements.And you're starting to invest and put.Energy towards people and not just.Projects and really want to see.Individual developers.And contributors creators succeed.Whether that's in a particular project.Or across multiple entries. starting to invest not just in.Projects but people.Is something that i'd really like to see.Coming out of this.This update so that's the that's the.Close.There's no context behind that picture.You get no context this is. inside joke now this is .Yeah thanks for watching.Before no before we before we wrap it up.We do need to share. the announcement blog post and we.Need to show the site.That's correct so you're ahead of.Yourself sir. I'm gonna share the announcement blog.Post right now in the chat.So if people want to head over and read.That it's basically like a nice.Shareable summary of everything we just.Said fantastic will you be able to pull.Up the site.Nice tada amazing so this is the.All new and and how convenient somebody.Just asked what the dates are for the.First round so we can go.Over that fantastic question but the.New site.Is over at communityfun.Stellar.org a.Lot of work has gone into the site over.The past.I don't even know how long it's been.Huge collapse.She she's a web flow wizard now.Designed this built this whole site.Basically on our own.Unbelievable incredible huge props to.Anka.For this incredible site but yes the.Stellar community fund has a marketing.Page and it's not just here's the rules. it actually outlines what it is the.Two different funds.We've got we've got we got an art we.Got a marketing video what.We're big we're big leagues colton yeah.I know.But anyways the website has a breakdown.Of both the funds.It has you know a couple.Step-by-steps it's got some featured.Projects it's got some.Cool illustrations of little astronauts.Which are amazing.But each each tab on there so the seed.Fund tab and.The lab fund tab I believe have not.Only prize pools but the dates.On when they start and a countdown timer..Which one are we on right now this is.The lab fund okay.So the lab fund actually I don't know.What the today's date is.August 28th which technically the the .The lab and the seed fund are open.For submissions right now which i.Don't know if I would submit today.Unless you've just been sitting on an.Entry but.They're officially both open right now.So you are welcome.To begin submitting projects to these.Brand new.Lab and seed funds so the lab fund.Obviously will close first it's the.Shorter fund. opens up today submissions will close.On september 21st so according to our.Countdown timer that gives you. about 23 days to submit to our very.First lab fund. the community discussion will then.I'm sorry the panel discussion.Will begin then on september 21st and go.Through october 12th.Then october 26th after the community.Discussion where the community will kind.Of go through the entries and ask any.Follow-up questions and have an.Opportunity to engage in.The entries the community voting will.Begin that'll go on for a week as normal.On that new flaggable quadratic voting.And it all happens right here so rather.Than there being galactic talk.And the voting page it's all integrated.Straight into start.I'm sorry communityfun.stiller.org all.Integrator right here you can go and.Log in if you are an entrant log in with.Your phone number and that allows you to.Enter.Your project if you're a panel judge.Which there's not too many of you but. if you are a panel judge panel judges.Will log in with their key base account.That's how we differentiate between.Entrants.And panelists and then you can go.Through.Your projects either to enter or to.Begin the selection.So this is all very obviously brand new.Experimental in a sense but we're very.Excited we put a lot of time and effort.Into this but as you have questions.Or feedback you can reach out on that.Stellar.Community fund key base channel or go to.This connect page where we've got a form.Down the bottom where you can also reach.Out as you have.Issues bug reports other questions if.You've got.Partnership opportunities anything like.That you can reach out.Through that form and then just to cover.Really quick on the seed fund.Timing you can check it out yourself but.Submissions are open now.And those will actually go all the way.Through january 18.2021.this is because seed fund projects.Are big projects these are not.Quick hey i've got an idea this weekend.These are big projects we want to see.Businesses coming out of this that will.Last.A year so we're putting lots of time.Submitting your idea to the seed fund.And then panels will begin selecting.Those january 18th that'll go on through.Till march 15th.Where the community discussion will.Begin that'll go through april 26th and.Then finally on. may 10th the community voting will.End the community voting for this is.Actually two weeks. but then may 10th the first seed fund.Will.Close out if you have other questions.About.The rest of the dates those are also.In another community post that we're.Putting out talking a little bit more.About the technical details.Behind the Stellar community fund.Yeah and if you if you go through some.Of the like submission requirements and.It's still not clear.Please reach out to tyler or me or.Anybody else to kind of discuss.Where your project might fit whether.In the seed fund or the lab fund.And we can definitely have that.Discussion and then you know see.Which part of those sort of requirements.And descriptions were confusing because.It's extremely important. that we clearly communicate the.Separation between the two.Yep so we've done quite a bit of writing.Both on those blog posts to explain the.New sef as well as.On these kind of these couple how-to.Articles as well as the guidelines rules.The phases. in the projects or in the rounds .As well as just a look at previous.Winners but as you go through that.Content if there are.Things you feel like we could do better.I mean again this is a community effort.Not just in the fund itself but in the.Actual design.Of the community fund so we're would.Love feedback and.Improvement ideas or are the articles.That you would find helpful.You can always submit those through that.Form or just in the key based group to.Make suggestions.Sweet and I think we've been going for a.Long time so.We can wrap this thing up yeah I mean.It's I'm super excited I'm I mean if you.Can't tell I'm i've we've spent so much.Time on this. as someone who used to participate.Like this is the fund I would have.Wanted.So I I'm so happy and excited to have.This live can't wait to see what people.Build. watching to see how it continues to.Mature.And iterate I would love to see the.Community get more wrapped up.In the community fund and engaged and.Have a bit of.Ownership around what it is and how it.Operates. so excited to be at a spot where we.Can finally launch this new thing.And really be starting continuing but.Starting from a strong place.To continue our community fund efforts.In aligning with the mandate that we.Have.For this particular allocation of lumens.Sweet thanks everybody.Yep thanks guys as you have questions.Again reach out.Otherwise it's been a lot of fun.Explaining it walking through it.And I can't wait to see what you build.And hopefully won't be too long before. before we have another one of these. live hangout shows.Maybe even next week Stellar podcast.Live next week.There's the plug.
