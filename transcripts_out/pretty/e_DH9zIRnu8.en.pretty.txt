Hello and welcome everyone to this.Week's Stellar Developer Meeting today.I have Christen from open sein here and. he's going to give a quick.Introduction to to open sein and the.Collaboration we've we've been having.For for a while and just have a quick.Checkin in on where where we are on on.Things with getting Stellar on open sein.So welcome.Christian nice question nice to meet you.Yeah so it's great to be here I.I'll give I think I can give more a bit.Of introduction about open zapping and.For the people that might have missed it.Our partnership the work that we're.Going to do with with Stellar if that's.That's okay yeah that sounds good that's.Great yeah I mean for the one that.Missed it open zein signed.Basically a partnership with Stellar.That is going to be two years long and.The goal is to improve the developer.Experience on on Stellar why why is that.The reason is that OpenZeppelin is of.Course known for being a security.Blockchain company we are like one of.The top auditing firm for security.Services but we built we built that.Based on our solidity contracts Library.So to give you the reference our.Solidity contract Library as basically.Processed over 20 trillion in total.Value transferred it now secured over.150 billion in total value lock.Processing over three billion of.Transaction 250 million active wallet.Use use opens app in contract like.That's huge adoption of course to.Give like a percentage like 35% of .Evm blockchain transaction are processed.For open Zing contracts and it's like a.Of course a big number that tells for .How simple how safe and how good is.For developers to build on top open.Zling contracts so the goal of of the.Partnership of with seller is to bring.That easy of building and that.Nice developer experience to to the.Stellar ecosystem we believe a lot in in.In the Stellar ecosystem and we want to.Grieve Stellar.Developers and Stellar develop. a great experience to build.Application better and and easier so .Over this year we're going we're.Basically going to develop a full soran.Contract Library bringing many of the.Flagship cont that we have on the on the.Solity library so like erc20 that is.Like fible token RC71 that are like.Nonf fungible token volt the volt.Standard and many others that are .Tailor it to the to the Stellar.Ecosystem and on top of that we're also.Going to build open source developer.Tooling that is going to help a lot .Developers to automate a lot of a lot.Of tasks one of those tools is Rel.Layers that allow for like gasless meta.Transaction and it works together.With monitors that we're also going to.Bring on Stellar so basically you might.Want to set some specific condition on.Your contract and what you want.Transaction of course to run.Automatically based on the parameters.You you set you will be able to do that.Very soon also Stellar and that's I.Think great and in general yeah we'll.Work on improving developer experience.Based on feedback by by the community.That's a bit on the general overview of.What we're going to build over the next.Two years it's going to be a long.Partnership yeah it's great I love.That it's it's going to make it easier.For developers to to add tokenization or.Add payments and also the secure part of.It the audit part of it I think is is is.A very it's a very appealing option for.Developers yes yes exactly.So yeah exactly the goal is to is to.Bring the more the more tools that.Can help really developers to to to.Build in an easy and of course .Safe Way and actually I mean it's we.We did very recently the first release.Of the of the.Library we actually released the.Fible token standard along with some.Extension that allow the allow for token.To have extension like minable.Burnable posable and a couple of.Other things it's just of course a.First simple release but it's it's.Already being used and that's that's.Amazing and actually part of this in.As part of this release we also added.Stellar to the OpenZeppelin wizard.Which is a smart contract interactive.Generator that I can share right now I.Guess right yep I actually have an.Opportunity to play with the the Wizard.A little bit and I must say this this.Makes it so much easier there's a lot of.There's a lot of thoughts put into.Building this it's very obvious and it.Makes it very easy and productive for.Developers yeah yeah exactly we this is.Basically the wizard interface we have.Many many users over over the over.10,000 users using our solidity wizard.That you can see as many standard that.You can take as a reference of how the.Stellar wizard might look like but yeah.We did the first release and the great.Thing of the wizard is that you can .Go to wizard.openpr.com Stellar and.It's completely free like you don't need.To create an account or anything you.Just go on the application and you can.Basically get your fible token.Stellar contract in in seconds I'm not a.Developer disclaimer I'm not a developer.I Le marketing at open zpp by the way I.Didn't introduce myself but it's.Actually also for me very simple to use.Like for instance like you just set.The name of the token I'm going to call.It like Christan.Token give it a.Sybol and you can see like the.Automatically parameters are changing in.The contract you can give a a premi.Amount of token this is the amount.Initial amount of Supply that he gives.To the token deployer address set.Like 10,000 token and you can see.It's appearing here on the wizard.Already with the decimals that it needs.To have and then you can set also like.Some features the first one they do.Basically what you see on the screen so.The first one is minable and it gives.Basically right to the the the token.Deployer to create more Supply at a.Certain point and if I click on it.You're going to see that it's atlet add.The code that he needs to.Add another feature that is barnable.And on this one the token deployer.Address is able to bar destroy some.Token at at will and the last one.Which I think is very useful also.Outside of token is posable that gives.The token deployer address the right to.Exactly own the contract and it's.Gonna basically input all the parameters.That you need you need to deploy the.Contract in here and I think POS is very.Interesting it's a very interesting.Extension not just for token but in.General for smart contracts that I.Think one one of the main things like I. I've been in the blockchain industry.For some time and like one of the.Core things of blockchain is always that.We always we always spe is like.Immutability which is a great thing on.One side but on the other side we know.That developing application is a custom.Process and sometime you're going.To need you know to have that function.That allow you know to oppose a contract.For security reason we work with many.Ds like compound scroll and others and. is a is a very important extension in.Case of security security events so.That's an important one and finally yeah.You have the license by default open.Zepp license are under MIT it's just.A note but anyway like you can select.Like your parameters and the the final.Thing you can just copy the contract and.Put it in your seller CLE or yeah you.Can also download it and do whatever you.Need it but that's a bit the overview.For for.Wizard great yeah and when you talk all.These features you just see that it just.Adds the the functions to to to the.Code it's really.Easy yeah exactly I mean it's great as I.Told you like I'm I'm not a developer.But I'm able to create a contract .A contract myself so exactly that's.Great you just toggle the button and.Exactly is going to change parameters.It's going to import what he needs to.Import and adding other function.Here at the end.So that's that's exactly the thing.And I think that James bakini also .Did a video did a video for for the.Wizard that both open zein and build.Stellar POS on X or.Twitter you can check more on that is.Actually put bring the wizard into into.Action and he really is able to deploy a.Contract on Stellar blockchain in.Five minutes with the Wizard and I think.That's a great thing right what I said.At the beginning the goal of partnership.Is to make development on Stellar easy.Fast and safe and Wier is a great tool.That now developers and Stellar can can.Use great yeah I can see I see James.Link to to James video and I'll.Recommend everyone to go watch it it's.It's it's it's really it's really a neat.Neat video and project so you mentioned.A little bit about Tooling in the.Beginning what kind of tooling are.You providing and what kind of what.What do I get if if if I sign up for for.For open.Sein yes yeah Ian the cool thing is you.You let's say you don't need to sign up.In terms of open the app we have the.Tag line somewhere open up in equal open.Source we are committing to more and.More to open source development and.We mainly do that through through two.Ways first one is contact libraries and.Again like every everything we release.Is you know on GitHub is public and we.Also encourage like we we encourage a.Lot of community feedback to improve .Our contract and that's one side right.You can take just open uping contract.Import in in the protocol that you.Need and you can build on top of that.And it's it's already great in terms.Of tooling we are building on top of.Defender that's an application that.We built with a lot of development.Operation tooling I mentioned before a.Couple that are Rel layers and monitors.But we will actually bring many more. so yeah I can give the round down.That is the first one is called Cod.Spector U that is basically used .To quickly analyze a a code base that.You can input into the tool to to.Basically give you back some known.Issues it's like a a mini audit.You're not getting the audit but you're.Getting you know the round down of the.Main unknown issues that your Cod.Might have so that's already a a great.Addition to check for you know non.Non issue another one ex I mentioned.Rel layers is very important like to .The automation process of transaction.And to working together with monitors.That you can set up really on any any.Parameters or condition that you want is. is great so you basically can create.Workflows right for your protocol .That are very interesting so to give.More like practical examples like you.Might want for instance you you.Let's say you know defi application.Can check on specific transaction that.On a liquidity pool for instance if you.See some suspicious transaction you.Might be able to like post the market or.You know CH change some parameters that.You want to change or something like.That or for instance another application.That maybe when maybe when .Users like sign up into the application.You want to send some you know a.Little bit of token to let them you let.Users play into your app because it.Requires some token you can do that.Through Rel layers and monitor so that's.Very powerful for building developer.Automations we're also going to build.Some other tools like deploy that is.Like basically a a tool that will.Help a lot with like actually deploying.Deploying smart contracts and making.That actually safe safe and easy.Especially when you know sometimes when.Deploying like new protocol version.Actually new protocol from scratch you.Have a lot of contracts to deploy all at.The same time and these tools come.Handy and we're also gonna build.Basically a tool that is I think for for.The first time we're building this to.Exactly for cell that is the test.Tool we still have to Define with.Together with the community what that.Actually will look like but the goal is.To bring a lot of more testing.Feature for sound contracts and make.Sure you know you can developers can.Easily test test early smart contct.Before actually putting into into.Production that's a bit of the overview.But as I told before like this is.Just the starting point two years is a.Long time in blockchain to build a lot.And we really welcome developer.Developer seller Community feedback to. let us know what they think what.They need and we'll definitely work with.Them to to make the best developer.Experience possible on.Stellar great thank you I don't know if.You have anything else otherwise we.Could maybe see if there's a couple of.Questions yeah no that's it let's see.If we have some questions but yeah.That's it let's go.Through I can see there's a lot of.Excitement about open integration in.The.Comments I see I see see one question. it's about if the partnership.Includes Upstream things to Sor B.Itself I do not know.That unfortunately I don't have to.Answer I don't know I don't know.Either I would need to check with the.Team. but yeah I'm sorry I don't have.The answer for that yeah no it's it's.It's early on it's it's like you said.It's a two-year project so we we just we.Just scr ing the surface right now and. and yeah I'm I'm super excited about.This about what what can come out of.This this partnership and and and what.It means for for developers I think it.Definitely offers some some some ways.For developers who may not have.Extensive experience in in working with.With tokens or or payments it's an easy.Way to integrate it so yeah thank you. if if we.Don't I see I see some question about.Nft that's exactly non fungible token.Are next on the list.To to be your list to B very soon.Very loose very soon and of course like.Actually something that I probably.Didn't stress is stress enough before.Actually you know putting every release.Into production phase we have a too.Internal audit opens up is again one of.The top auditing firm we have audited.Really so many of the.Leading blockchain protocols like.Unop before 1 inch compound Mor for.Very any of the top protocol you can.Think of in in blockchain opens up.I've audited many of those guys so.That comes you know with a lot of of.Security yeah nft is next on the list.Upgradeable contact are.Also coming.Soon okay great.See I don't know if you have anything .About there's a question from Matias.About the USC 6900 I don't know if you.Have any any thoughts about.That I don't to be honest I think.I mean what we can do is also what we.Shared before we can have another.Developer me.And we can have like actually the.Developers from open Zepp that are.Building the library at the tools that.Can give more insights.Into into the tech that we're going to.Build yeah I think we should do we.Should do we should do some followup. follow-up meetings because as as .As everything develops I think it could.Be interesting to get get some of of.Your engineers on board and maybe do.Some do some examples of how to how to.Use the the open S integration so so.Yeah I'm I'm looking forward to see.What's coming up and I'm happy to to.To do another session later so yeah.Exactly exactly I see last question.About like U from t like if the the.Parcl like audit for seller funded.Project we are also bringing like.Audit to Stellar but I you can.Check with like the Stellar Foundation. that it's up to the Stellar.Foundation if you know do such a program.But we're also bringing like auditing.Services to to Stellar if that's the.Question okay and then there's one .About point of view on classic SL soron..Bridging I see I see I don't have an.Opinion to be honest on yeah it seems it.Seems to be maybe a little bit out.Outside the scope of what's yeah yeah.Yeah plan for a little bit but yeah it's.Nice to to be honest many interesting.Questions and I can tell from the.Marketing side I've been seeing a lot.Of excitement from the Stellar community.And that's like great we work again.With many other successful chains and.And protocols and the Stellar.Committee is one that is really. something that you notice you know. when you do stuff so that's amazing.I'm really excited again for the.Partnership and having another session.Of this involving our developers .Answering more technical question I'm.Sorry.But I can't go any deeper than that.No no and that was not that was not the.Plan for for this this is more like an.Introduction to the the partnership that.We have and a little bit of an look.Into what's what's coming up and and.What's already there so so so yeah we.Will do a more technical session at a at.A later time but thank you so much.Question for for joining here today I I.Think this is super interesting this is.A good it's it's a good addition to our.Tool belt for the developers so so.Yeah thank you for joining and thank you.Everyone else for for joining today and.For all the questions so see you next.Week thank you thank you very much Caron.And thank you to everyone all these.Amazing question and the people you see.You next.Time right.
