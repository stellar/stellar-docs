All right all right all right.Here we are finally the .The Stellar round table on .On nft so we are going to talk about.Non-fungible tokens today.I will admit it wasn't that long ago.Before I thought.This had something to do with mushrooms.Or.Fungus I didn't know what a fungible or.Non-fungible token was that was.Definitely one of my most.Earliest google queries.Back when I was first getting introduced.To this concept. we've got we've got a a fun little.Discussion for the next hour or so we've.Got some. fantastic guests on .I'll start with myself my name is tyler.Vanderhooven I'm the ecosystem.Evangelist at the Stellar development.Foundation.I spend my day writing documentation.And doing workshops and building apps.And understanding what the ecosystem.What folks like.These panelists here are up to.Day-to-day so i.I think I have the best job but could be.Wrong. if you all can go ahead and make sure.You are unmuted.And and we'll go ahead and go around.This.Proverbial round table maybe steve if.You want to .If you want to go first a little bit.About yourself how you got into Stellar.In what you're up to.Yeah absolutely cheers so my name's.Steve I'm the ceo. at task we've got involved with.Stella.Moore through the community fund. we've been working with Stellar for.Two and a half years.Task is a is a system that allows.Organizations to. connect and engage with their their.Teams gather information.Provide rewards and incentives through.To teams and then take all that.Information and report back to investors.And donors in the market in general.You know that's predominantly what we do.Interesting aspects about how we believe.Nfts can be used which.Looking forward to getting into later.And that's all from us.That is me super fantastic really.Excited to have you on particularly.For that.Less than traditional use case that we.Might think about when .When we when we use that word nft .Fred how about you.Yeah hi everyone and thanks for.Having me so .And also I wanted to say anion gaseo j.And all korean still up.And watching at that time so my name.Is federico.I am the founder of lightmint I'm also.The owner of.Teleport so lightmint is a gaming.Platform basically connecting.Gamers to the crypto world with game.Asset ownership. cross currency decentralized.In-app purchases.And also a lot of other features that.Leverage the Stellar blockchain.So just recently and it was alive with.Sam conner on monday we unveiled our.Nft and collectible marketplace on.Stellar.And the marketplace basically was.Created to.Connect the dots between between all.Our products.To provide more synergies and it will.Accept any kind of nfts.It will be available publicly within the.Next few days we are still fixing a few.Stuff.And yeah I will talk about it a bit more.Later.Super yeah very excited to have you on.Board you've been around for a long time.In the nft space.Super excited about that nft platform.Can't wait to start playing on that. zach how about yourself Stellar zack.Hello hi my name is zach I am the.Director of marketing.Solar development foundation which may.Make you wonder why am i.Here to talk about nfts on an ft.Roundtable.My actual introduction to the space .Was actually blockchain collectibles. pre like 2018 like 2017 2016 kind of.And it's been interesting to watch.The evolution of that kind of thing and.The evolution of digital ownership.And i've got a lot of thoughts just.Generally just having explored this.Before.My time at SDF and yeah I'm excited.To hear.What how we how you guys are.Implementing this stuff. into your current solutions or use.Cases so yeah.Super yeah very excited .Zach and I have a fun little history of.Before either of us worked at SDF we.Were we were doing some stuff around.Color glyph that's how we were.Introduced. not exactly nfts but still the idea.Of crypto.Gaming items and memeing the internet.With.Strange and wonderful digital items .So for our first discussion topic i.Think it's good to lay a groundwork kind.Of create a foundation.Around definitions were you going to use.The word nft.A lot I think.It's an acronym but the acronym maybe.Has grown a bit.Beyond just that or nfts have grown a.Bit beyond that.Fred I remember when you were talking.With sam connor a couple days ago you.You touched on this a bit.That nfts is an acronym but it's grown.Beyond that a little bit so if you can.If you can briefly touch on when.Somebody says nft.Or when you think about it what does.That mean to you what does that mean to.Your users. and how does that affect the way that.You build .Build enlightenment or products.Supporting nfts.Yeah I mean so nft is essentially .Like yes strict definitions they are.Unique assets.And that means they are not.Interchangeable but yes the way people.Use.The term nfts these days is more to.Describe a wider range.Of non-fractionable assets right so.So they are not necessarily unique.And yes this definition fits better much.Better.The the current use case of nfts which.Is essentially.To provide proof of ownership for .Digital content. within a decentralized world right so. so yeah that I think with the more.And more decentralized. and the more and more disengaged our.Digital.Platforms become the more nfcs.Are meaningful yeah I remember when .Because nfts for me obviously kind of.Meant that that acronym but then I saw.An auction or a sale or something that.Was a one of 10 nft sale I'm like.I feel like we're moving beyond what.Nfts actually are and they're starting.To take on.There's nothing wrong with a one of 10.Sale of something but that's not what an.Nft.The acronym is so maybe it's starting to.Move beyond that I don't know zack maybe.You have some thoughts around. this concept of moving away from.Just an acronym to.Taking on more of a ideological .Ownership.Freedom there I mean I i'll echo fred.I mean 100 it's it's like digital.Ownership stuff.Early on I mean if you look at I mean.Outside of like colored coins and stuff.But moving into like early ethereum.Collectibles all you had.Were to work with erc20 like contracts.And you know my like the stuff we were.Working on were.Modified erc20 contracts that like.Tracked ownership. but they were like single like .Not no decimal thing so like we were.Thinking about things like trading cards.Or like.You know rare like rare items and.Drops and video games or something like.That.Like those things aren't unique in that.You can.Like you'll have multiple mickey mantle.Cards in a baseball card pack.But there's only so many that exist and.So I think.The acro acronym doesn't bother me.Because before there was nfts that.That concept existed anyway and so if.That if we're calling them nfps now as.Like.The broader space term I don't think it.Matters if it's a one of one.Or a one of one thousand because the.Principle is the same it's not it's not.Like a currency or something else.Yeah yep yes that digital ownership that.I think is so interesting and. that that being what people mean when.They're talking about nfts is taking.Whatever we used to mean.When it was physical ownership of.Something and finding a way to turn that.Into.Digital ownership where you can transfer.And.Gain a lot of that same value where I'm.Holding the one thing or.There's only ten people in the world.That have this somehow you can replicate.That digitally where you're not.Physically holding an item but that same. that same construct is is existing.Steve did you have something to add.There.You know what I mean I agree with zach.In that I don't.For me if this allows generation of.Limited editions which.Really is the kind of one to ten or one.To a thousand the.The lovely thing about nfts is it's.Empowering artists again. you know art from pictures to music.And all sorts of creativity.I think when you combine nfts with smart.Contracts.We're going to see a wave back I mean if.We had.Digitization came in you could copy and.Paste everything we saw.File sharing if you look at the music.Industry.The only musicians you can see now.Typically a huge artist because you make.All your money going on the road.I think with the nfts and smart.Contracts and the way that.In which you can start to reward people.We can go back to the.Old kind of cottage industry of.Someone's in their bedroom.They're pumping out great tunes and.They're making great art and there's a.Way of them having a revenue stream.Which respects them as an artist and.They they don't need to be.You know going on the road I think that.Will.Be really lovely to see because it's a.Kind of it's going back to.The value of art before digitization.Kind of took that away.I would even take a step further and say.You know the art stuff is really cool.From a perspective of the artists are.Are basically the guinea pigs in this.Nft experiment they're out there and.They're putting these pieces out.And they don't know what the like long.Term how the format's gonna treat them.Like what they're gonna do.But you know they're they're testing the.Medium but like.They're there breaking grounds for i.Think things we talk about.Like there's projects in our ecosystem.Already that are thinking about like.Fractional analyzing things like real.Estate.But if you're just like a normal like.Person and you're buying like a home.You currently have to go through.Something like a title company.And multiple parties and there's an.Evolution in the future where nfts.Like an artist could create a.A beautiful piece and it could be.Basically the digital representation of.The title.For for a home so you could have thing.Other things represented as nfts like a.Home title or something like that.It does end up circumventing like.Processes right now that.We have to have a title company because.The title company is the source of truth.For the owners like who owns the house.Or who owes the title to the house.But like nfts you know that that.That concept applies very nicely to to.And I think the artists are breaking the.Ground here but the digital ownership.Doesn't stop just with art.And it doesn't just and I think fred's.Take like.Yeah I think you guys are obviously.Pushing beyond just the art stuff.Here as well yeah I mean to me one of.The.The main use case as well of nfts and.Basically being able to address the.Digital goods needs.Is the fact that if you look at the.Industry today you will see for.Example in the music industry.Spotify is a platform that controls most.Of the paycheck of all those artists.And we have the same in the gaming.Industry with the app store the play.Store.And with this the availability of those.Items.Outside of those platforms and on the.Centralized platforms on decentralized.Networks.Then we can really like break out from.From this model.There was a I just wanted to add with.You know.As you break out from that model as you.Look at things like .You know land ownership I mean for me.I'm very interested in that aspect of.Actually taking the digital certificate.Having it mapping on to physical objects.I think there's a lot of potential there.But I think when people say well.What's the point.A really easy way of summarizing it is.You look at something like.Fake degrees any of us can go out on the.Internet we can we can go and grab a.Fake degree of of whatever.And you know it's not the biggest.Problem we have in the world but.In terms of fixing that problem with a.Which is you know simply tied to.Someone's domain with a.Tamil file with an issue you know an.Asset that's being issued.Now you've got your nft certificate. it's very you know and it's. you know you've got a degree .That tumble file can be at harvard or.Whatever the education institute is.You've got a you've got a yeah two.Second check.And the the other bit that I think can.Become interesting is that can become.Automated. background checks just get automated.No one needs to actually go and have a.Look at anything.And you could extend that further into a.Personality test so.If you want to apply for a job i.Complete some personality tests I'm.Quite happy to.Open that up for someone to look at so.I'm sending.Nfts which is you know here's proof of.My degree.Here's some personality insights to see.If I'm right for the team.There's various other kind of digital .Aspects of my personality.I could be putting forward and then you.Know you you almost start to get rid of.Hr.And recruiting departments as that.Automates loads of systems there and it.It's not the biggest problem in the.World but I think it's a.I think there's interesting models of.Using nfts in that type of way.Yeah it's something that's been.Interesting even on .Stellar quest because we we have these.Different challenges that people do and.They.Earn badges and it'll be it'll be.Neat like.You don't get those badges unless you've.Completed the challenges and so.Having those badges in a wallet that you.Can verifiably prove that you have.Ownership over.Is a stamp of i've gone through Stellar.Quest series one or Stellar quest series.Two and. that that that means that I know.Something about Stellar because I can't.Get these badges any other way. that's that's really neat and so the.Nft is a vehicle. for for trust or a vehicle for .Assurance for an employer to say okay.Well we need somebody who knows Stellar.I hope they I hope they do oh look I can.As long as you can prove ownership over.This account that you say you own.I I can have some level of assurance and.Seeing that model moved out where nfts.Are a vehicle rather than.Only a piece of art or something that.You you.Own is as the item itself but more.Vehicle towards something else is kind.Of cool. so that was that was kind of our our.Initial introduction to what nfts are.And how they're being used.A bit in the real world today and i.Think we've already touched on it a bit.But if we could transition slightly .To there's so much hype and and buzz.And noise around nfts if we boil some of.That away.For you all personally what what do you.See the value of nfts. for the for the spheres in the realms.You're in we've already started touching.A little bit those.Those begin to show themselves in like.Product use cases and.The things that you all are building .But if you can touch on those. a bit more in depth of what if you if.You scrape away the.The noise what do you think will be left.From.From nfts in in five or six years. maybe steve if you want to take that.One first. well in five six years.We will definitely be collecting nfts.Because I think as humans we just love.Collecting stuff so that you know that.The collectible aspect and you know the.Getting away from the ridiculousness of.Buying pixels for.For millions of dollars there's gonna.Be.A steady state of very happy adults and.School kids.Collecting lots of interesting stuff.Because we just love doing it so I mean.You know that that's great there's.There's that.Certification aspect which I think is.Personally I find that.Interesting I think it can solve a lot.Of problems if you.If you expand that certification concept.In terms of.Who is doing what who you know who's.Doing what which can be at an.Individual level it can be a.Organizational level.I think if you look at Stellar .Or any blockchain similar to Stellar in.That mission which is get the finances.Through.Get you know get finance financial.Fluidity globally.That's that's one problem you solve the.Next problem is.Is it going to the right person one of.The key issues that we have is.Finances finances being misdirected i.Think if you combine the certification.You can start to direct finances in the.Right way because you can start to get.It through depending on particular.Certification and deciding that that's.Going to be the way that you.Would send finances through so I think.Reputation and building reputation. certification can work in all sorts.Of ways that tie and automate.Financial distribution I think.The the other bit that.I hope will be something we see in.Four five six years and it's certainly.An area that I'm interested.In personally is that.If we look at the key issues we face. globally the incentive schemes don't.Work.And I remember a friend talking to me a.Couple of years ago.Talking about you know natural assets.How can you take national.Natural assets and convert them into.Investment propositions.If you could if we accept that human.Greed is is typically what drives things.Then could you harness natural assets in.A way and turn them into investment.Vehicles.Where they give financial roi.And there's then a desire to protect.There's a desire to.You know whether it's you know.Reforestation whatever it happens to be.Now if you take the nft and you can.Track that.You can use that to track physical.Assets.Natural assets you can then have.Investments into.Say forestry there's a.The potential of you know as you as you.Purchase younger trees if there's.Evidence that they're growing that asset.Goes up in value.Naturally over time and if you're using.It as an nft which is tradable. you have a natural asset which people.Can be trading and I think.It's a it's an idea which I think if you.Get the economics right you could.Go out and start to solve some of these.Problems because a lot of the problems.We have are just because the incentive.Schemes are totally wrong.So I'm hoping that there's potential.There long term for nfts in terms of.Natural asset investment yeah.Fantastic I echo a lot of those.Sentiments personally myself. fred how about you.Yeah so I mean there's a thing that says.There's no bad publicity right but .So I think somehow these stunts are also.They are not the ultimate use case for.Nfts. but you know we we can't stop the.Excitement.Of of this part of the human nature.And then also. you know nfts as a as a much.Wider appeal to mainstream than.Cryptocurrencies for example so I think.All this is part of it we need to be.Careful. to not engage into too much.Destructive reckless behavior.But I think somehow there's also good.Side.Into this this kind of hype and.Around nfgs so yeah definitely not.Everyone is gonna sell. the first five thousand days for 69.Million.And that's definitely not the use case.But so the way I see.Nfts in the that contributing to to a.Better world is.Is essentially being able to to power. decentralized world right that's what.I was saying just before.The the ability to to disengage.Completely from those platforms.Because currently let's say you are a.Game developer.The only opportunity for we for for.For you to to sell nfts .Or sell in-app purchases is to go on the.App store on the play store on steam.On all those centralized places which .Somehow they impose their rules and we.Saw for example with the.Games like fortnight what happened.When the store suddenly.Decides to put you out and same.For the.For for the music industry so basically.That's the way I see nft is.Powering a decentralized world of.Tomorrow.Yeah zach I mean I was just going to say.Like I'm going to take fred's thing.And what steve says and then I'm going.To say you said did not hype. but I feel like this is going to come.Off feeling a little bit like hype.So the current like situation obviously.All this like.The the art trade stuff there's a really.Unique thing happening where you're.Seeing.Like boutique shops now open up that are.Going to they're like labels I would say.If you look at music industry or like.Art world or they're like an.Agent where they are going out and.Seeking people and they're like trying.To set them up.With like an nft strategy for releasing.Their stuff.And that's going to go away at some.Point there will always be boutique.Stuff but like.Right now that's where the opportunity.Is but as people figure out like the.Strategies for this themselves it will.Grow.And I think you know what I was writing.About a lot back in 2016 and 2017 was.Like where are we going to go as far as.Like working in the future I wasn't.Expecting like pandemics and stuff but.Like we have this everybody virtually.Now has introduced the internet because.Everybody was at home for a year.And so you know offices may not.Necessarily be the same kind of thing so.You can have virtual neighborhoods you.Can have virtual workspaces you can have.Like this weird match between virtual.Reality and augmented reality you need.To still have.Traditional things like like people.Still will live in houses people will.Still own cars there will still be.Like things that need to be bridged from.The traditional world into this world.But like I think what i've seen happen.And even going back to fortnite like.Yesterday I think epic.Announced that they had gotten a billion.Dollars in funding for.Something called the metaverse which is.Going to be like brand disney world i.Guess like vr.Brand disney world it'll be like ready.Player one I see those kind of.Environments growing.Second life is a great best bet.Experiment for virtual real estate.Like they're all this stuff to fred's.Point about like.Decentralized world like that will come.It may not come in the next year and it.May not come out of this immediate cycle.But people like are are definitely.I think thinking about where to get to.That point.And what that means like am I going to.Be here in 25 years is this a five year.Thing a 25-year thing like.How long will it take for adoption and.What steps are required to make it.Easier but I think there's just.Infinite applications it just depends.On how.Digital we decide to get as .As a people.Yeah it's just to comment on that this.Is.Going off piste a little bit so pull me.Back if it's gone going too far but.I think I think there's when you look.At collaborative currencies. if you look at collaborative.Currencies which then complement a.Traditional currency so you have.Communities that can use a currency.Between each other.Then again in my brain I see.I always see the nft with a smart.Contract and being connected with some.Sort of inputs.The outputs can be certificates in.The form of nfts and.If you look at a collaborative currency.Where communities are working together.And you're looking at reputation and.Understanding trust between the.Different stakeholders within the.Community.Then I think nfts can come in there if.You look at that kind of.Absolutely digital future .Decentralized future.Then you know how do you how do you.Automate.Reputation and and understanding the.Different players within that community.I have a another thing that kind of goes.Off of that that i've been.Chewing on recently and that's on.Legality of nfd stuff and ownership like.What when.I'm purchasing an nfc now what does that.Actually guarantee me as far as rights.I know you know if platform developers.Have to consider copyright.And like cease and desist and you have.To there will be tools to hide things.From platforms. platforms that allow you to mint.Through them obviously will have terms.Of service that are like.Hey you can't do these things but.Because of how.Their these assets are represented on.Chain like.Just removing them from a platform.Doesn't remove them from existence.And so I I'm wondering if there will be.A big giant lawsuit one day where you.Have all these collectors.Basically suing for rights to use art.That they've purchased.And or vice versa and what those.Actually guarantee and I'm curious if.There's a whole industry for like terms.Of service that may need to come out of.Like like what I suspect there will be a.Court case that resolves that if you put.The terms as a service on your nft.Itself when you mint it then that will.Be the legal.Grounds but anything done without that i.Feel like is going to.Have a bad time but I don't know what do.You guys think as far as like what.What does owning an nft guarantee you.Fred I think.For steve or tyler.That's definitely something that for.Example in the ethereum world they.Started to work on that.You can see dapper labs I think .They started to specify.A license called the nft license you.Can you can read it on nft license.org i.Think.And it specifies a lot of things about.This but yeah that's definitely a rule.Nfts cannot address with the address.Ownership they don't address the.Copyright.And you can obviously have a lot of.Votes they're..Difficult to to address the.Question to the group what's the.Situation with gdp.Gdpr blockchain nfts because.If you're let's say a blockchain.Provider and someone decides to put.Personal identification information.And Stellar would be in the memo field.What happens whereas the.Where's the blame where's the right to.Be forgotten exercise.That must have come up in conversation.I'm I'm just intrigued to know. well fred do you want to tackle it.Or I'm not I'm not expert on that yeah.So.Yeah I'm not legal I'm not a legal.Counsel or anything like that so I don't.Know if I necessarily have.Have the greatest answer for you but i.You know something like we maintain like.In through a service that.May be something like mailchimp or like.Emma or whatever like some digital.Database of.Things that's easy to go into and remove.Because there's.Personal information identified with the.Service that.Has those tools but with a decent just.Distributed network like.Like bitcoin or like ethereum or even.Stellar like.What's on the network part of using it.Is you understand that that's what.Happened there's no it's immutable.Right so you're not like you can't undo.This stuff. so I don't I don't know I mean I feel.Like that's probably a whole different.Conversation of like what happens when.Personal data is on the blockchain. about kyc aml stuff to roll into it's.A big question.I I don't know I don't have an answer i.Think it's pretty.Yeah for sure I mean so much of the the.Liability there is.On the entity that that put that data.There but because.I mean the the assumption is or the the.Way these laws have been written is the.Assumption that if you put it there you.Can also take it off and so.The laws revolve around take it off you.Know remove it delete it but when that.When that assumption is no longer true.You're going to need different rules. and I don't know what those are going.To be other than I think it's probably.Going to boil down to.You need to be really careful what you.Put on a blockchain and that there's.Liability for you.As as someone having access to the.Blockchain particularly.Less around tools like Stellar which.Aren't designed for.Arbitrary data storage you can put.Arbitrary data on there but it's not.Designed for that but I would that my.Concern is more around things like.Ipfs and filecoin and.Our weave and these these blockchains.That are specifically designed for.Arbitrary data storage. that becomes more that becomes a.Bigger issue where.Your purpose is to store arbitrary data.And so the assumption will be I'm going.To use this instead of my database.But if you don't understand what you're.Putting on there is immutable. you might end up in trouble yeah you.Know what.It leads me to believe though like i.Feel like any.Like based on no precedent or like court.Cases I can't pull anything up I'm just.Pulling this out of thin air but I feel.Like with you know with the internet.Everybody's just using browsers to.Interpret like things like you can have.A hardcore user that like.That's you know doing it through I don't.Know them.Like like they like how david uses the.Internet I think is the best way. but like you can also and and that's.Gonna be very specialized and people are.Aware that like there's a dark net as.Well like there's a.Or you can use onion like routers like.Whatever like but that's not the primary.So my assumption would be just like any.Platform it if a primary.Way to display this information like.Foreign is a great example because nfp.Let's say an ethereum one that's just a.Smart contract there's not.An image associated with that there's.Not you have to like.Interpret that through whatever thing.And and like called ipfs so you're.Viewing it in a viewer or something like.Most people you know if they can't see.That or they can't view it they're never.Going to see it so I feel like that's.Good enough.As long as it's for a majority I mean i.Don't think that's.Going to settle a court case you know.Saying oh that's good enough they can't.See it but I think.You know that's kind of how the.Internet's treated currently like you.Know what's.You know as a user on the internet what.Acceptable use is.To some degree I feel like maybe not.Maybe that's.A wrong interpretation.Yeah it'll be it'll be interesting for.Sure to see and that that to me is one.Of the biggest.Outlying I wonder.So for example the nft license that.Has been specified by. by depot labs so they say that we can.Take.An nft on a marketplace as long as we.Can prove the ownership. that the ownership is is proper.Before putting it on the marketplace so.I think the marketplace will have to.Do a lot of things in order to to to.Prevent.Being being under all sorts of things.Like that.When when you look at the future I mean.You're going again going back to.You know zach said about that digitized.Future when it will happen of course.The the lovely thing is when a system is.In is invented which is.What we have with with blockchain where.It's released and it can't be stopped.So with nfts I suppose there's that same.Question which is and and tyler you were.Talking about you know.True decentralization of nfts the other.Day you know how did you how did you get.To that state now you have.You have these and we perhaps should. talk about this which is you do have.That you're talking about your.Description was you're looking through a.Window you have to go to the shop look.Through the window and.And look at your nft how do we.Decentralize that the second you.Decentralize it.Then the laws have to wrap around the.Nfts and not the other way around I mean.Do you want to could you go into the.Opportunity for decentralization and.And creating that sort of system yeah so.I mean the way that almost all if not.All.Nft marketplaces work is is there is.Interface that you're accessing your.Nfts through.And there is some where you can you can.Take your nfts and view them on some.Other blockchain explorer or some other.Interface but there tends to be that.I can only get at this through a browser.Through a particular website.And particularly when you split the the.The nft.Between the contract that allows you to.Sell it.And the actual representation.Of that asset the the and the ipfs.Address or.Whatever it might be that actually holds.The image or the art. you're you're beginning to to.Centralize you're at least beginning to.Silo.The usability of that thing to where.Yeah.If if your nft is inside ethereum.You have to look through a window .Open c or look through the the.Foundation to to.See your nft but if they decide.To pull the shade on that and you view.That url.And they've they've decided that nft is.No good anymore.You've essentially lost access to that..And so being by decentralizing that.Again yeah you're what you're doing is.You kind of have to take the reason that.They might pull the shade and address.That before you ever mint it.And almost put the the viewing mechanics.Or the access.Mechanics and bake that into the nft.Itself so whether that's.The code to view the nft along with the.Actual art for the nft.But all of the pieces for how this thing.Is represented.And x access so not just the security.But and not just the the trading of the.Thing but the actual.Access to the thing the way that you.Hold it and identify to.Those around you look at this thing that.I own whatever that mechanic is that has.To be part of the nft too so that.Access to it is is just as central to.The thing itself so that you're able to.Show it.But when you show it it's also still.There it's so strange.That these things are split because if i.Hold a baseball card all of that.Is contained in that baseball card but.When we've transferred that digitally.We've split these things up and siloed.Them to where each one can fail.Individually.And now you're holding up a baseball.Card but there's no image on it.Or you're holding an image in your brain.Like no I can see it in my head.But nobody else can access that picture.By having the card that you're showing.Them it's.It's weird to think about but that's.That's the world that we've created when.We've siloed all of these things.We have to find ways to bring those.Things together. in my mind or else.Invariably you give it enough time these.Things are going to be siloed things are.Going to go away.And all of the things that we're.Purchasing and accessing now are going.To be so broken. that they won't have the value that.They have and there's going to be a lot.Of.This sort of hype that goes way up none.Of it's going to work.And it's going to leave that bad taste.In everybody's mouth and we're going to.Have to slowly crawl.Back up before we're able to.To start innovating again.How much does that fit with did stella.Want to fix that problem or does it.Conflict too much with.Being fast so there's obviously a big.Difference between.The Stellar development foundation and.How we use Stellar and how we build.But Stellar itself is an open protocol.That anyone can use for their purposes.So it's.If you approach seller and you think it.Can work for your purposes.Go for it I don't think it's something.That SDF is going to.Work on where we're cross-border.Payments where .Open access to the world's global.Financial system it's.It's a different goal I think there are.Some crossovers particularly when you.Start to.Define what is value or what is a.Financial like what is that what does.Financial access actually mean what is.Finance.Those things I think begin to be.Answered differently when it's digital.But when you look at Stellar itself the.The protocol in the network and how.Changes are made to the the ledger. the cryptography behind it that works.Great for all kinds of use cases outside.Of this there are certainly ones that.Don't fit.But if you approach.The network and and see that it works.Well for your use case there's nobody.Standing in line saying sorry.Yes it can't do that and I think I mean.I think any of this stuff like.Even if SDF is not like we're not.Internally developing nft.Standards I think that you know we're.Having this conversation because.Some of you guys are and you know.I think that it would be worthwhile to.See.A conform standard or two for this.Across the platform you know we've been.We've been talking about it now since i.Started sdf.And I'm like i've seen fred's.Ideas for like how he's doing it i've.Seen other people.Working on projects there's a couple of.Other marketplaces that have been.Launched.Simultaneously and it's just been.Interesting to see.How the conversations that have happened.Over three.Four years are now starting to like.That work is now dropping and it's.Really cool that it's dropping.Simultaneous to the.Like hype cycle because it's not like.Like the work that fred for example has.Done is new it's not like he just spun.This up because suddenly.People sold stuff it's something that.He's been doing for a long time.And you know some of these other.Projects that are also issuing entities.On Stellar.So I think a standard would be great.Like an ecosystem standard but I think.You know it's going to require use cases.Which I guess is my.Other point is like I think a big thing.We're seeing is a lot of people want to.Issue nfts on Stellar because nfts are a.Big deal but if you look at.Like right now in the space and you'll.See other networks and.Not name or bash any of them because i.Don't think there's anything wrong with.It.Saying like you can issue stuff on ours.Here's here's the platform to do it.I think you know people will try that.Stuff out.But the nft collector the one that.People are thinking of right now they're.All in ethereum.They all have and and I think the way.That you really.Get people to use nfps is through use.Cases like lightmint is a great.Like you make the game the users just.Want to play the game if the nft is part.Of that experience.You know they can learn about how that.Functions as they learn.Like that community and environment and.Ecosystem and platform.And I think like actual use cases will.Bring people.To networks and they'll get nfts through.Those use cases.I think that just issuing an nft on.Stellar because you want to do an nft.But you don't want to pay 70 dollars in.Gas on.Ethereum that makes logical sense but.It's not going to attract.The current like insanity that you're. in other like on ethereum around it.Does that make sense yeah I mean i.Wanted to.Get back just about the because the.The way. on the storage first for nfts.The way I chose to approach this.Problem with enlightenment is basically. by not addressing this problem so.Essentially .I use what steve was pointing out .There's a step one specifications from.Stellar ecosystem a proposal standard.That allows us to describe an asset.Through a normal file and that's the.Only thing that the lightweight.Market.Place we will basically care about so.Whether the item is stored on ipfs.Whether it's.It's stored as a managed data inside.The asset itself.Is not something that the marketplace.Will address basically as long as.Your item is described properly within.The domain file.Then it will be displayed properly to.Users on the marketplace.And I decided to use that because at.The end it's.Currently a standard that is used for. Stellar for describing all assets from.And this way I don't make.Assumptions about how.An event will stand out will come later.On for for.For storing the data because there's.Also another thing that I was.Wondering and is.Yes it's nice to have access to the.Art.In a kind of a permanent way but is it.Really where the value is because if you.Look at.For example the way the first.Five thousand days has been sold for 69.It doesn't really matter if someone gets..And you can actually get the high.Resolution copy on ipfs for that app.It's it's not what carries the value of.The item.What here is the value is the fact that.Someone has the signature to sign a.Transfer. transaction to to pass ownership of.That of that up.And even if tomorrow the only trace.Remaining of that art is. like five by five pixel resolution .Of of it I think the value will still be.There because someone has. the ability to sign the the.Transaction.I would agree with you on that point.To.To most degree I think you know.Newcomers the space.They want the art and so when people.Pull things like.Change the art on open sea like that.Becomes a pseudo-news article because.People are like well.It's gone but if you look and listen to.You know the people who are doing art.With bitcoin like colored coins or.Rare pepes or like if you listen the the.Early ethereum.Like style nft things that have been.Converted there's arguments about like.Are you purchasing the ledger history.The signature like the ownership here.If you can track the origin of like the.The first press.Then that and like it goes back all the.Way so like.Even if it started you know on one.Chain and ended up somewhere.As long as you can trace all that back i.Think I think there was an article.On italic recently published around.Similar.Idea it's like that's that's what you're.Purchasing and I think to fred's point.About.Art is like art people are minting these.Pieces as art currently.There's no reason that that people piece.Can't be like a legendary sword in.Somebody else's game.And in that regard that aspect that.Asset is going to be represented.Differently.It exists on chains so if you hold in.Your wallet you can like.You know it's proof your ownership so.They can pull that from you know whether.That's.Albedo or metamask or whatever you're.Using from like these things or.However the game interacts with these.Assets so just because it was minted as.And there's an ipfs that goes along with.It doesn't mean that every application.Of that.Asset that exists has to be art related.I agree 100 and I think that's a really.Important distinction to make.Particularly for the future of.Of nfts even in just identifying what.Are people actually buying what are they.Actually getting what's the legally.Defensible item that you're arguing over.What's the thing that's valuable and.It's interesting because the.Representation.Like traditionally in our brains when we.Think about art we think about.What are you getting it is the music it.The picture it is but because it's so.Often tied to the medium by which you.Got it it's hard to separate those.Things out.But when you actually look at what are.You selling like if I go and i.Steal that image and and mint it myself.Outside of there being copyright issues.It's not valuable because I'm not the.Artist.And I can you can prove that I'm not the.Artist I didn't actually make that thing. and that's where you get an art fraud.Now is you're not trying to find which.One.Looks good you're trying to find this.Artist was famous.This artist was the real deal and he.Painted something.We need to find that one because he.Actually touched it and.It's less the the item and more the.Assurance that.The person behind it the the the.Certification that it's legitimate. that's what the blockchain gives you.Not not the.The connection to the pixels or the the.Sound.Waves or whatever scratches on the hard.Drive.Might be like the thing that's valuable.Is is the.That are that origination the.Certificate .And that's I think we need to keep that.In mind particularly because I think.It's extremely interesting that art.Might change.That as something gets purchased it's.It's programmed to change in a certain.Way over time and.We even start to do represent like if.You had you know. this 69 million dollar nft but you.Could somehow load it up into a game.Maybe it becomes this weird meme thing.That no matter what game you're in you.Can load.In this nft and it gives you superpowers.Like that's really interesting.That's something you can't do with.Physical art .That would be fascinating when you start.To approach what can we do.With this medium that's innovation.That's something that we can we can only.Do because it's digital there's some.Really fascinating things that I think.We need to start exploring.By moving away from assuming that people.Are buying.Pixels and instead assuming what's.True is they're buying certification.They're buying something on the.Blockchain they're buying their stamp.Their.Their part of history in the in the.Chain of whatever.This thing originally was because it's.Actually quite simple when you get down.To what is something value like what.Makes something valuable it's just what.Is someone else willing to pay for it.And so long as you can make that a large.Group or large amounts of money. the assurance there is on the.Blockchain and that is good that that.Does work that's already been proven the.Attaching images to that that's that's.Difficult and there's legal issues.Around there but if.If you can rather just have this.Chain of things this chain of events and.Transactions and assurance of ownership.Particularly.Originally which you can do now.I think you've got something that you.Can really begin to innovate on.Cool super sorry are you.Off to you tyler no go ahead well I was.Just going to.Come up but there was a just a model.Which I had a conversation with.Someone the other day.It was a interesting brainstorm yet it.It's combining smart contracts with nfts.Is using an nft.To to represent some physical. in this case let's take a tree so.The person I was speaking to was saying.That they wanted to plant trees.And they hate the these models where you.You know a dollar a tree.The tree gets planted it gets ripped up.Six months later the.The question is if you want to plant.Trees. you need them to be there five ten.Years to get the benefit.So that's an asset which is which is.Developing over time.It has more value the older it gets.Typically and.So if you take a smart contract and you.Tie it to an nft the nft is tied to this.Case let's just take a tree it's.Probably going to be a number of trees.Together.And in the smart contract you say to the.Donor okay you're going to.Invest 10 into this smart contract and.When you do that.You're going to get the nft which.Represents the tree.The smart contract then is where there's.Checks going on to look at that asset.Over time.And put inputs into the smart contract.Saying hey tree's still here.Everything's good it's being watered and.On that basis you've had the ten dollars.Going to the pool.Say there was a dollar pushed out at the.Beginning to plant the tree.A year later you have a couple more.Dollars goes and it's going through the.Community that's.Looking after these trees so you can use.A smart contract combined with an nft. and if the tree goes you can burn the. you have a way of of relating. and having a long-term investment.Around.Natural assets I think you know.My the way I explain it is probably not.Not that clear but I think there's a.A useful way of investors being able to.Put money into a smart contract.Nft representation and a long-term view.I don't know what you think if that.Makes any sense at all.It's super interesting and I think that.The issue for me becomes around how do.You make assurances.Between something that's strictly.Digital and programmed and something.That's very much not like what's to.There there has to be those reward.Mechanisms kind of like what you.Mentioned that.Like what's to keep me from taking an.Axe and chopping down the trees so that.I can plant another one and mint more.Tokens and get more money like.Somehow make it monetarily worth keeping.That tree alive.And I think some of the problem is there.But I also think there's opportunities.In in nft spaces or even just.Tokenization spaces.Where you can get retail investors.Involved where it's not big corporations.But individuals have.A tree token and somehow there is that.Ability to.To keep tabs on what's happening though. implement economic models that make.It more worth it.To to keep these things as as long-term.Investments or. opportunities for for foresters to. ensure that they're they're doing the.Right thing that there's monetary.Incentives for that because.Right now so much of that is flipped.Where as long as it's.More worth it for me to do the wrong.Thing will I will I choose to do that.More often so we have to flip those.Economic models to where. either either there are smart.Contracts or or legal contracts in place.That disallow that or disincentivize.That or.More preferably there are economic.Models in place that are more worth it.For you to do the right thing that you.Actually.Earn more money that way and those those.Are tricky but I think one of the.Reasons they're tricky is because.There's so many middlemen and.So much of these investment.Opportunities are locked out to little.Bits of money.Who don't have large they're not trying.To make a million dollars off of an.Investment they're trying to make.A small moral decision of I want to do.Some good in the world and it doesn't.Matter if my one dollar makes two.Dollars in five years.I just want to do some good and and have.Some assurance that the good I want to.Do will actually happen. I think I think blockchain has a lot.Of potential to open up opportunities.For just by the nature of removing so.Many middlemen.Because rather than having human.Contracts in place.You have computers again it's it's math.Instead of morals that are.Addressing these things and I think.That's that's a powerful.Tool that we that we're only really.Starting to scratch the surface on how.That moves just beyond.Kind of converting traditional finance.To digital finance.There's some really interesting.Opportunities there but they definitely.Remain to be seen.How successful those can be over the.Next few years but innovation in that.Space is definitely needed and I think.It's.It's valuable to look at that .Not to throw a loop here because I i.Wonder if there's some questions. available but I also had a quick.Question for fred regarding his.Platform that I got a sneak peek of the.Other day. because I think you know.Similar to how well I don't know let me.Let me just ask the question fred.For your platform like you you're.Sharing.That you had some like cross-chain kind.Of compatibility.And that you it looks like light mint.Marketplace you become an anchor.Essentially right like you are an nft.Anchor.For ethereum ones with that.I mean essentially during the live i.Wanted to show that artists let's say.You had issued some.Assets on some nfcs on ethereum so.The goal was to show.How you can benefit from Stellar to.Alleviate all the fees.And then also still sell your heart you.Know because what what people may not.Realize is that.Stellar is actually a lot of tools.For working with nft so for example you.Can use.Path payments in order to have not.Just cross-asset.Exchanges but you can also have bid and.Offer discoveries.Which means that basically it's a very.Powerful tool to connect.Buyers and sellers and if you are an.Artist on ethereum then Stellar is a.Very. it will become a very valuable.Platform for for.The goal is to make it an alternative.Platform for those sellers.In order to allocate the fees there's.Also another things that can run on.Ds decks that people may not realize. it's for example you can use a.Time-bound .Transaction in order to settle all the.Bidders and the participant in an.Auction.At the end of an auction after a.Specific predetermined.Period and you can also use.You can you can use the path payments.Tricks and.At the end of the auction also to.Implement a reserve price and things.So Stellar is extremely versatile as a.Protocol in order to.Implement all those and people need to.Realize that.It could become a very good alternative.To to those.Networks that at the moment have a big.Problem with speed.Do you see compatibility with other .Networks as well outside of ethereum.Potentially.No I did not investigate more but.Yeah I think the yeah their goal is.Really to make it.Like that if you if you are an artist on.Ethereum then i.I want to make it that you can try.Stellars and alternative and.Benefit sweet.I think that clarifies my my question.On that.All right well this is I don't know if.Anybody has any last minute otherwise.We're going to open we have a couple of.Questions from our engaged and.Interested audience which I would like.To pose to.Post to the group .So maybe for this would be an.Interesting one any plans.And this this is kind of a little bit.Towards . SDF or at least the the Stellar side.Of things but there are there any plans.To make non-fractionable.An option in the tamil file it'd be.Great to issue.Whole coin nfts instead of 0.00001.Nfts so how are you addressing that how.Do you think we should address that.There's a.There's SEP work to be done here there's.Also smart contract stuff that can be.Done here. some of it's just display mechanics.Right on.The platform that you're displaying your.Nft on because you don't.At the end of the day it's it's a.Display thing but I don't know fred how.Are you addressing the zero zero zero.Zero zero one.Issue yeah so this is like this has.Been a hurdle. for for developing the the.Marketplace because.First it's not very friendly to users.But there's also some limitations on.These dates because of the.32 limit so there's you can't price.Easily an item over 214.75.Of any unit so in order to solve that.For example what we do we use a.Intermediate market so in instead of.Posting just one big offer we post two.And we issue an asset and price this.Asset the problem is that it creates.Cryptic orders on these decks.So I think there's definitely a need for.For addressing this.In order to make it clearer to prevent.The the creation of those.Buffering assets and yeah that could be. I'm not sure my favorite ways.Would be to go with lifting the limit.Of it in 32.On the on the s decks that would be my.Favorite way the most natural.And then also in terms of being able to.Create.Non-fractionable assets or fractionable.At.Very specific decimal place then that.Would be.That would be the best the best foster.Yeah there's definitely a lot of.Different ways to.Address the issue there's a lot of.Reasons that they are issues whether.Selling issues or selling issues on the.Decks or just visibility issues where.It's weird to see that much fraction.But I will say you don't you can issue.Particularly because we have.Functionality around auth required flags. you could issue one of something.And then if you built a smart contract. through either the Stellar turret.Network or.Even just a centralized service that.Allows people to sell.Buy and sell that asset you would .Basically allow that that sell that sale.Of the nft only through. this one like endpoint where it.Opened up. authorization to whoever was.Purchasing it sold that asset.In an atomic swap on with the operations.And then closed.Access so you could you can absolutely.Do this already.It's just not incredibly natural .But it can absolutely work I'm.Particularly interested in the atomic.Swap stuff because that removes so much.Of the math issue.Where you can you can sell 0.0000.Whatever for.An infinite amount of the the counter.Asset or the max.Amount of the counter asset and not run.Into any math issues it's just that.How do you create that transaction in a.Decentralized way where there isn't a.Third party that.Boy I sure hope they don't go down or i.Can't move my asset.So work in that arena is something.That's super interesting and to me and.Stuff something that I'm I'm.Particularly focused on. good any any follow-up.Questions around that otherwise we'll.Move on.So here's one I want to buy a house with.A stranger.This has been historically a horrible.Idea is there any way.Xlm or nfts can alleviate all of the.Problems with co-ownership of homes.Or real estate I don't know steve.Zack thoughts around co-ownership with.Strangers on houses i'll let steve go.First.I'm happy to as well I was gonna say.After you but i.The short answer to the question is no i.I think you still fall out the same ways.I mean it's there's going to be a.Contract of some sort between you.But maybe I'm being limited in my.Thinking what do you think.I think that nfts can solve a lot of.Issues with traditional real estate.I think if you but I think one of the.Things and this is.A spiel that I'm working on so I'm going.To test it here it's like.With all these other networks you know.Decentralized.Distributed trustless systems or that's.The highlight right so like bitcoin is.Pressless period of your payments.Ethereum is stressless like applica.Decentralized applications.And you can you know build on topic for.Financial stuff.Stellar is interesting because there's.This inherent requirement for trust.On the network because it tethers not.Only digital assets but also real world.And so if you take that kind of same.Principle to nfts like.You know there will be things that exist.In real life that.Can exist in both worlds but you will.Still need to have a.Trust in like whatever that custodial.Power is so when I'm talking about nft's.Like circumvent the title company you.Know.Ideally you know that the title.Companies would.Anchor these assets and just adapt to.The space instead of.Be relegated out it creates new.Economies for them.They could have better processes maybe.That lowers the cost for even doing the.Signing table stuff.Instead of getting everybody in a room.To sign like they can just.Click a button and digitally transfer.That and so.While you still have a record of the.Physical thing in their vault you now.Also have a.Digital representation that anyone can.View on ledger. and I think that you have to have.Trust when it comes to real world.Assets and there will always be have to.Be a facilitator for that.But I don't think that means that you.Can't disrupt.Systems like housing now with.Fractionalized stuff through the.Questions point you already have.Projects on Stellar that are.Are doing that kind of stuff where it's.Like an apartment like share like.You can fractionalize that and that's.Been a big use case that i've seen. there's yeah I think a small handful.Of companies doing some cool stuff with.Already on the network so that's that.Use case is.Proof like that that can work but that's.A different.That's a different model completely than.Like something like just.I want to give self tyler my house.Here's the title.Okay bye like it can't do that we can do.It with cars for some reason though.But the government still verifies that.Here in the united states.Yeah there's reinvention of systems.Which is great I suppose I interpreted.The question of. will I better live with the person.That would be using fft.Oh yeah I may have misinterpreted it as.Well then.Yeah yeah depends on the .The use case here we are we you know.Gonna live in the house or are we just.Using as an investment because.Investment I think there is opportunity.But.If you're just buying with a random.Stranger on craigslist that's .I don't know they're still humans .Well sorry.Just just to comment on that tyler it.That is it gets really interesting.Because.If you look at ownership if you if you.Do if you take what zach says and you.You create a system where.The house is is kind of containerized.Within.Nft or nf it'll have to be a number of.Nfts and if you can then.Easily split ownership.You know you can then take you know a.50th.Share of a house have that as part of.Your investment portfolio.Have everything transparent that you.Know that's.That's interesting and from a portfolio.Point of view I think so too.Particularly when you start again.Opening up to retail investors or this.Idea of.Patronage where you tokenize. a restaurant or something and .People who.Who like that restaurant or when you.Look at art.It's not so much an investment that i.Hope to resell this thing I just want to.Support the people that I love and the.Art that they do and the things that.They make. there's a huge target for that and.It's not it's not driven by.Greed necessarily at least it's not.Monetary greed it's just I like this.Thing I want to see it exist and.Thrive and there's a whole market out.There that I think we're only beginning.To really start to tap into that has.Nothing to do with me getting rich.And more me enriching the the artists.And creators that I love .So we need to we need to close out here.This has been this has been a fantastic.Conversation one last question here.For those who are not developers or.People that . maybe more on the art side of things.This would be a good question perhaps.For .For fred how can they get involved how.Can we start issuing art.And music and begin to take advantage. marketplaces like what you're what.You're building fred when.When are we going to get access what .What's the plan for the future.For non-developers what's the what's the.Path forward so it's going to be.Live very soon just fixing the.Last details especially about.Trust stress testing and and security.Because we have created some some kind.Of .Like contracts with pre-order.Transactions just want to make sure that.There's no issues with this.And this is going to be live on.Lightning.com on the website you will.Have tools.To create and without any programming.Required.To create to issue your asset on Stellar.Just need to specify the art and if you.Want to you can store it on ipfs you can.Install it.Somewhere else and also we are also.Going to.Run an anchor for you so there will.Be a review. we but yeah you will be able to.Issue your assets.Without any technical knowledge.Fantastic very excited well thank you.Any closing closing thoughts comments.I mean.I I only have two closing things santa.Won the first to bounce off of fred i.Think there's. I think keep an eye out for that I'm.Eager to experiment with it after seeing.There's also others I think around the.Ecosystem already that you can play.Around with that do it.Like ever trying I think account based. nfps and I don't.Have the urls off the top of my head but.I'm sure you can like dig around a.Little bit if you're part of the Stellar.What I would say to do is that if you'd.Want to see and if more nft projects on.Stellar get involved in the.Conversations on.The dev group about it and like start.Talking to other people that are.Developing.Nft based projects so some standards can.Get.Uniform across so these different things.Can begin to interpret.The same like different assets that are.Published the same way.That would be my closing statement yep.Yep absolutely Stellar global find us on.Discord and .Start start the discussion that's a.Great place to land I don't know if .Anybody wants to call out where they can.Keep up with you and the work that.You're doing.And then we will we will close out steve.If you want to start where.People can keep track of the work that.Yeah absolutely well come and say.Hello at task.I o.My like to be on on twitter I'm. at steve walker without an e at the.End so steve w-a-i-l-k-r.And great to connect and really.Appreciate you.Inviting me in today it's it's been a.Great experience thank you.Super yup it's been great to have you.Fred.And sam so if you want to connect.With the project you can come and join.Our community.We are we have a discord community over.A thousand members.Lightmint.js you can type in your.Browser and you will.Get the invite link and then I'm there.Almost every day to talk so if you have.Any questions just.Don't hesitate and zach where can people.Pester you.You guys can tag at `stellar.org` on.Twitter and I will.See every single thing that you have.Ever pasted .There multiple times and yeah and.Then also.You know the regular places .Cubase all right super and once again.I'm tyler vanderhofen you can find me.T-y-v-d-h.On twitter that's the best place to find.Me I also do hang out on discord.Occasionally.This has been a ton of fun thank you all.For joining .We will catch you later hopefully .Conversing around art.Thank you very much see you all thank.
