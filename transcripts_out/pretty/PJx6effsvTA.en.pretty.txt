Maybe with that box a little bit this.Way I don't it makes much difference but.Okay hello everyone this is a very.Special edition of our weekly meeting .With me today I have the entire deal.Team so.Hello and to kick it off I'll hand it.Over to to Nicole hello everyone I'm so.Excited to be here with the entire deil.Team we are in San Francisco having a.Deil offsite and talking about all the.Really cool fun stuff we have planned.For this year and so we thought while.We're here all together we should you.Know get together on this call and .Say hi to everybody introduce ourselves.Probably and talk about a couple of.Things we really loved last year and.Some of the things we're excited about.This year so I'm really excited to.Here and I'm excited to have everybody.Here with us. let me see I guess I'll kick it off.So hi everyone I am Nicole I am.The manager of the deal team I've.Been here for almost two years at SCF .And I guess let me start with what I.Loved about last year and then I'm.Going to go around and let everybody.Else introduce themselves but last year.Two highlights for me were protocol.20 soron sorry nobody else can take that. and Meridian ha Meridian Meridian.Were really really awesome it was really.Cool and fun to just be there and.Like see builders and see all the.Amazing projects that came out over like.24 hours and it was really awesome so.I'm going to go this way to LA.Hello everybody I'm Elliot I'm your.Friend I'm so excited just to be aart.I've been around Stellar for like a long.Long time and I still just feel so lucky.That I get to do this like for work and.It's amazing one of the things that.There's.What we are excited to do also not yet.Not yet yeah.Saying it's.Frozen dead for me we're.Frozen oh yeah yeah the frame rate looks.Kind of janky can you hear.Us.Weird okay they said we're back okay.Yeah.Yeah the all right nice are yes monitor.Yeah yeah I'll just do this the whole.Time.Okay so they did see me waving all.Right oh they want to zoom in I don't.Know how to do that we can do.That control camera frame people we're.Experimenting live.Really really bad.Hey you don't know how these cameras.Work real tight on Ty yeah hey.Everybody I'll move to like whoever's.Talking if you just let it do this thing.All right let.Me braing.People.Okay Elliot are you done yeah I'm done.Sorry okay go ahead.Okay hi everybody my name is Bri wild .I'm a writer on the deil team I've been.Around for three years and I love it.Here very much I know Nicole took the.Sor Bond.Launching which is a very exciting thing.But so one thing that we did last year.That was it's not very glamorous or. fun but we Elliot and I worked a lot.On bringing the soron documentation to.The Stellar documentation site so.Lots of docs work and then making.Sure everything is yeah updated in the.Documentation or yeah soron being on.Stellar and something that I really.Really enjoyed is kale so if you all are.Not farming kale you should be and.Yeah that's probably like one of the.Most fun things that we've done she's.Just saying after she's on my lead board.I Am Number 10 10 on the leaderboard so.She do.Address so that's that's it for me.So hey everyone I am Chris natalo .Last year I escaped the ethereum evm.Ecosystem and joined Stellar in.July and yeah definitely not looking.Back I am biased but the community.Here is like way more authentic way more.Legit if if you go to like most.Solana or ethereum discords people are.Asking when Moon people are asking when.Air drop you know but in the Stellar.Ecosystem people are like really helping.Each other people are building real.Things people are just really excited.About like actually authentically you.Know building on the ecosystem so that.That's a really awesome change for me .I guess like last year I think one of.The things was like putting Stellar back.Like on the map you know we had big.Presents at a lot of major events like.Decon and people are talking about.Stellar and yeah we were getting a lot.Of exposure on on the like in media in.The in the crypto Twitter sphere yeah.Just see lots of lots of great activity.Around Stellar you.Know with we we actually just fixed.Fa it is working again we're.Actually at the dev offsite right now.Talking about.When she.C 2.0 we will let you know.Soon but yeah yeah just thank you all.For being a part of the community and .Yeah yeah yeah my name is carsten I'm a.Developer advocate in the dev team and. I joined in July last year and I.Would say the the one reason I joined.Was San but at least that was why I got.Super interested in in Stellar I think.Adding smart contracts just made a huge.Difference for me it it was all of a.Sudden a really interesting chain you.Could build whatever you wanted the.Sky was a limit so I thought that was a.Really that was a really interesting.Time to to join I love to see what.Developers are building I love to help.Them in any way I can Meridian was a.Is was super exciting last year getting.To meet a lot of the developers yeah.Lots of interesting talks it was.Super great experience to to network.With a lot of the builders on on and.San yeah.Tyler hello everyone I'm Tyler I'm.Also a developer advocate here I've been.Here for five.Years last year a highlight for me .Was kind of well we we knew pretty early.On that we wanted to add the SE p256 R1.Signing curve which doesn't mean.Anything to really anybody unless you.Maybe a little bit more Technical and.Understand like that's that's what the.The signing curve that's used in for p.Keys but taking that like journey of.Super technical all the way through to.Now you can sign transactions with your.Face or your fingerprint and having to.Build all the technology to .Facilitate that happening that was a.Huge highlight for me I've also I.Have a long history on trying to give.People xlm and it's very hard to do.Without having to go through a whole.Long process of kyc and collecting tax.Stocks and like I just want to give away.Xlm and let people play games and.Launch tube was a a huge I mean it kind.Of killed two birds when we don't kill.Birds it what did we say fed two birds.With one seed. where where we can with a launch tube.Token I can give away a launch tube.Token without having to do any YC let me.Do any tax do collection and allows.Developers to submit transactions on.Main net using the the xlm that's.Held within that launch tube token.Because they can't go and farm those xlm.Out of that launch tube token and take.It and do nefarious things which is why.We have to do kyc and collect tax stocks. and that that is awesome but then.Also there's the problem of when you.Actually want to do something on mainnet.Yeah you got to like source xlm to pay.Those fees and it's like students on.Sell is really cheap but you still need.To have that xlm so it doesn't really.Matter how cheap it is if you have to.Like create a coinbase account or a.Binance account and figure out a way to.Like connect your bank and then you got.To wait and that Journey from I want to.Go to mainnet to actually being able to.Do that is pretty tricky until you.Introduce something like launch which.Basically lets you get transactions on.Chain for free and it handles all of the.Coordination of paying the feed.Simulating the transaction super super.Neat Service was was really excited.To get that online last year and it's.Kind of been something that I've been.Trying to press and work towards for for.A long time so those are definitely two.Two big highlights for me from from.Last year.Awesome all right what about this year. I get to go first which means I get.To take the best ones but no I so.This year we have a ton of you know I.Plans and ideas and we're g to share.Them as like they develop but I think.Like for me as we're at this offsite as.We're thinking as we're making some.Of those plans I'm really really excited.That like this is the first year.Obviously that we're starting off with.Smart contracts on Stellar like.Obviously we had all of last year but.Like we can hit the ground running this.Year with smart contracts and there's a.Lot of really really fun stuff I think.We can do and that we want to do and.That we're planning to do and.I think I am GNA share my screen.Because that we're looking for that.We're.Us audio back my check all right so it's.All.Right I stop talking confirmed can you.Hear.Me all right let's just keep it here.We'll share that link got it yeah yeah.Okay so yes his audio goes with me.Screen share okay big takeaway more.Monthly active devs coming in sticking.Around that is one of our big numbers.Number go up and I think it's really.Exciting so number one Tyler number.Two yeah the the other. number that we're trying to .Press up to the roof is daily contract.Invocations I think I can share a.Link since I'm not going to be able to.Maybe screen.Share yeah can we can't do waiting is.That one right there so there's a dune.Analytics this is the number this is the.Graph that I'm most interested this.Next year is pushing his daily contract.Invocations off I want to see.Sorbon be very active there's a lot.Of different ways to do that there's a.Lot of reasons that you may want that to.Happen but the technolog is awesome.And if you're looking at that graph you.Can kind of see that it hasn't been used.A whole lot I mean we we're hitting an.Average maybe before November of.About 2,000 or so invocations per day.Which isn't terrible but it's certainly.There's a lot of room to grow there .And then you can see this massive Spike.That happens in November December so.That triggers off when Enrique.Launched his.Fcm proof of work contract that I.Think was one of the first like fun.Things goofy things to do on Soroban that.To me really pointed to this punch of.If you if you introduce some fun things.To do on so not just the serious grownup.Blockchain things but just fun things to.Do goofy things things with stories and.Lore and what not that you can actually.Get a lot of activity and so I also.Built a improve of work asset that.Addressed some of fcms just had a.Different philosophy of how to grow.And introduce people to the platform and.That's where these numbers really start.To to take off where you have a minor.That you could use the CLI for that's.Kind of that first time.And then I introduce the website for.Farming kale and it just kind of goes.Through the roof you can see it's.Starting to taper off now these these.Fun activations often have a pretty.Short life cycle where they Spike up.People have fun and then they're ready.For the next thing I've likened it to. kind of like going on vacation or.Going to a water park like you're not.Going to stay there for the rest of your.Life you're going to go there you're.Gonna have fun and then you're gonna be.Done and you're going to go home and.Then you'll do something fun another day. that's sort of kind of things that I.Like to work on are flashes in the pan.Lightning in a bottle you work on.Something that's fun see what works what.Doesn't then you iterate work on.Something else so I definitely am.Working on my next big idea to try.And keep pushing these numbers up and I.Kind of my challenge to the developer.Ecosystem is to also think of fun things.To do on chain and make 2025 a year.Where we're really trying to push up.These daily contract invocations which. make the chain look very active and.Engaged so when you combine those two.Things of monthly active devs and daily.Contract invocations those are really.Good numbers those are numbers that will.Attract more and more attention.Attention activity beets more attention.And activity so combining those two.Things together I think will help us win. over other change that maybe when you.Start to dig into the ecosystem a little.Bit more and you do want to begin to do.More serious things it's quite hard.To do because the those relationships.Haven't been built with traditional web.To technology or traditional Finance.We've solved that problem but we need to.Solve the attraction developer attention.And. just getting developers to build.Stuff on chain so there's lots of great.Things you can do and now we just need.To bring the attentional build the water.Part as it were one little fun side. I can't share my screen so I can't.Share that one but I think it is really.Fascinating on this particular graph it.Says that 1.5 almost 1.5 total smart.Contract invocations 43% of those came.From launch tube so almost half of all.Of our smart contract invocations went.Through launch tube which to me again is.Pointing to this idea that when you make.It really easy for people to submit.Transactions on chain without having to.Fiddle with xlm that combined with the.Smart wallets where you don't have to.Download anything you know there 24w.Passphrase and all this sense and you.Can just click a button and you're on .You get a lot of traction you get a lot.Of users like kale has only been around.For a while it's also like what are we.Supposed to do with this game like it.Doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.But people love to play it make.Something that's maybe you know a little.Bit more interesting this number will.Just continue to to go up and up and up.Because we have these tools like the.Pass key kit smart wallets and launch.Tube we're getting on chain and doing.Something on chain is very easy for.Users. so now that we have those tools in.Place it's time to build so we just need.To build build fun.Things sweet awesome so monthly active.Devs.Invitations per day those are our two.Main goals as a team again I'm really.Excited about the fact that we can hit.The ground running in this like new.Exciting way and that we've got all.These resources these you know tools.That Tyler's built that can like.Extrapolate out from build upon as a.Team and as an ecos in general what is.Everybody else excited about so a lot of.Developers tend to have brilliant and.Creative ideas and my strategy is to.Wait for them to do that and then snatch.It so Tyler has done a lot of really.Cool stuff or a lot of really amazing .Tools and projects and just really.Creative and Innovative things and my.Plan very soon is to try and break some.Of those things I'm going to build some.Projects on not not like on his I'm.Gonna break my own duplicate or modify.Or build on top of the things that he's.Building like a a taale marketplace.Where you can exchange different.Produces maybe depending on how much.You're willing to stake different.Invokers contracts for that kind of.Stuff and just generally having fun.Messing around with the things that he.Built and trying to show other people.How they can do it.Too sweet.Awesome I can go next oh Carson go ahead.Guys I'm actually going to talk a little.Bit to what Elliot said and what Tyler.Said because I think for for Elliott to.Become successful in Building Things.Based on launch tube keys and and all.These things just like any other.Developer I'm sure he would appreciate a.Lot of good documentation showing how to.Use all these great tools and and that's.Something that I'm excited about taking.Some of the really cool ideas and cool.Projects Pass key is a game changer in.My in my opinion but we need to make it.Accessible we we need to make it easy.For developers to adopt that also OT so.It's easier for him to do all his fun.Projects.You can just go and read the.Documentation so so that's that's.Actually something I'm really excited.About getting these Technologies more.Accessible for developers make it easier.Make their adoption time faster they.They they we need to get these brilliant.Ideas out there and have them used by by.Developers they should not just end.Up in a repo somewhere they need to.Get out and get get to work so that's.What I'm excited about that I can take.Some of the ideas that Tyler has and.Some of the projects he's built and.Document that and show develop us how.They can do something similar and.Hopefully that'll Inspire them to build.Something different but maybe based.On on on some of these ideas so so yeah.I I just felt it was kind of a little.Bit natural to jump in here.Perfect cool yeah so I'll good next .Yeah so yeah I feel like the outfit in.The room for all of web 3 has always.Been self- cust is a non-starter for.Most users it's too complex you know.Honestly passwords aren't secure you.Know the number one password is one two.Three four five six seven you know so.Pass keys are a game changer you know.And all the major companies are are.Using it are implementing pass Keys you.Know GitHub Google you know so once.You lower this this onboarding.Friction people are going to start.Coming into it you know and if and once.You lower the development friction.People are going to start building you.Know so with pass Keys kit with launch.Tube with all these amazing tools that.Are facilitating and enabling developers.To build it's it's going to unleash the.Floodgates and what's going to come.Through those floodgates I think it's.Gonna be a lot of D5 protocols you know. like some people say TBL is is kind.Of a vity metric but honestly I think in.Web 3 defi is going to enable whole new.Business models right we for for.Instance in web 2 the only two ways you.Monetize are ads and cers so like once.You have defi as a foundation you.Enable all of these new amazing use.Cases on Stellar and that's that's.Really what it's all about you know is.Just like unleashing the creativity of.The developer work for us and just.Seeing what what you guys build you know.I'm just like super excited to see like.What do things new models new paradigms.People build built on D5 built on chain. just totally changing the game you.Know because Stellar Stellar has has.You know a lot going for it it's super.Fast it's super cheap and it's where.Blockchain it's the real world our audit.Offer ecosystem is you know way better.Than any other G so like yeah I'm just.Super excited to see what people build. I can't wait once we put these tools.In your hands and you guys build some.Magicw.Excitement excited for.Bri a lot of things I guess I'm.Really excited to bring.Yeah just like I'm a writer so bringing.Awareness to all the really cool things.That all these amazing people are.Building in this room and also the.Ecosystem as well I did write a piece.On blend recently that was really fun .So talking about yeah talking about.Projects and how projects are working.Together and putting together blog.Pieces to kind of bring awareness to.The really cool things that are being.Done is what I'm really excited about.And hopefully continuing to kale lure.Because I'm obsessed kale and I just.Write more.More so.Yeah Tyler I think you already said what.You were excited about.Right yeah I mean I'm excited to see.The daily invocations go up I really.Want to see I want to see a a pass.Key a smart wallet get like an actual.Interface get audited like we're using.Them on Main net and we're holding pale.In them. but I want to see one of these.Actually get audited and get much.Wider use I want to see a lot of.Fun things to do on chain that are.Orbiting around these pasy wallets where.There's an ecosystem that kind of grows.Up that knows has buil some standards.Around how.To interoperate between websites like.Pesis are not terribly intuitive to.Figure out how to share them so we'll.Need some coordination and standards but.I think you know 2025 is the year the G.Address dies and and the C address reign.Supreme it's not everyone agrees with.Me but they're wrong because address is.Going to take over the world and I'm.I'm here for it all right well that's.Prediction.So all right another thing we thought.We might do just as a team in the same.Room is you know we are very very close.I think we're like a month and a couple.Days from the anniversary of svon a.Net and so we thought we would you know.Either share a favorite story from the.Last year cool development you.Know projects that were awesome that we.Saw come into the ecosystem. who would like to start I won't take.The first one so I you know whoever.Submitted that first transaction on.Inter they that was so fun and smart of.Them to do that I wonder who that was I.Just thought they that was amazing I.Mean within literal seconds that it.Closed it's like they really worked hard.To prepare for that.Moment for that to happen and had.Waited for for many many years for smart.Contract so I don't know you know who.That was but tudos to them for working.And doing that and putting a little poem.On chain is the first.Transaction you know it's funny because.Tyler really likes to be.First really really liked.It sometimes he's not first though and.It's really fun that is like the most.Fun when he comes in second you.Know please yes what will we share oh.Favorite Memories the the other thing.That I think was really cool was blend.Launching because I've followed their.Story so closely since way back when we.Were doing turrets and we were using.JavaScript VMS as like an L2 to try and.Figure out a way to do smart things on.Stellar and so following their Journey.From really when I first joined as a.Contractor at SDF way way back when.They had found Stellar and were trying.To figure out how to do some of their.Advanced stuff they were still like in.College and super smart but trying to.Like figure out to do what they wanted.To do on Stellar and then working.Through with the the turret smart.Contract protocol and then actually.Building a smart contract protocol and.Convincing the network that we needed.It and that we should build it and then.Working through to actually see that go.Onto Main net and then seeing blend.Launch on mainnet and people actually.Using it and now there's tvl there that.That narrative kind of seeing that come.All the way full circle and go live .After just years and years and years of.Watching that team and working with that.Team that was was a really cool moment.For.Me.Awesome everyone.Else stories.Favorites from last.Year one year of Sor.Bom I think I can something that that I.Think is has been a really good.Experience is that we we have worked.With an incubator in collaboration.With cell Community Fund and and Ru and.A couple of us have been a mentor for.Some of these teams and see them come in.Some of them not having any experience.Writing smart contracts they had an idea.They had something that they thought.They could build and in a matter of.In some cases days but in a couple of.Weeks some of them have the first smart.Contracts up and running they they.Building they they're really.Enthusiastic and I think when you.Consider that that soran is not even one.Year old that we had the tooling we had.The documentation we had sample code I.Think that that's we can't give the the.Team that worked on San enough credit.For that I think a lot of in a lot of.Other cases it takes years to build.Out documentation sample code have a.Support system and and being able to.Really do something substantial and I.Think I think U I came in later I can't.Take any credit for that but I just.Think it's amazing to see developers get.Up and running writing smart contracts. deploying deploying their contracts.To to to test net and to main that.Within few days after the first time.They ever get to know about soran so.So I think I think that's I think.That's a that's a really cool thing and.I think I have a lot of appreciation.For all the work that went into that up.To the the launch of.Soran yeah that's.Awesome yeah I think a big narrative for.Last year was the onchain effect so.Having narratives if you're familiar.With the story basically there there's.An entrepreneur who was in San Francisco.Columbia that was able to extend.Opportunity to be a remote personal.Assisted to people that live in a cash.Only Village and they were able to.Basically hold their Savings in stable.Coins on Sellar and get money out.Through money graah via our our.Integration in their local currency and.That was like a narrative U that I saw.Like repeated on you know on LinkedIn on.Twitter by by non web3 people I saw.People on Web Two In traditional Tech.Even not tech people like Echo the story.That just makes sense normal people you.Know it's like it's a story you could.Tell Grandma to you can tell to Grandma.Over the Thanksgiving table that you'll.Understand so like seeing a A Narrative.Of story that actually resonates with.The like non crypto people it like shows.A real use case like this is what you.Can do on chain that that was an.Amazing story and it was only possible.On Stellar that was one of the big.Highlights for me last here for just.Seeing the real potential of crypto.Other than meem coins you know other.Than PP do fund not that there's.Anything wrong with Bean points you know.Fun is fun people love fun but.Yeah okay I guess like one thing that's.Been really fun as I've just like.Been able to write about Soroban is kind.Of why sorond developers have made.Certain decisions such as like State.Exploration and you know how metering.Works for fees and that sort of thing.And just kind of how the platform is.Being built for sustainability and.Learning from the experiences of like.Other networks has been really really.Cool to learn about and gives me a lot.Of faith and you know I just.Really think that our I don't know that.The developers are amazing that I've.Built the platform and making these.Kind of hard decisions and talking about.It has been really fun and interesting.To see and also really fun and.Interesting to write about so yeah.Yeah yeah that's awesome I mean I feel.Like I'm just gonna Echo what everybody.Else is saying but like you know it was.I feel like there was there there were.Moments of kind of crystallization of.These things like half.Meridian everybody who was there sat in.That room and didn't sleep and made.Stuff that was really really awesome.Overnight and you know like. I mean I just think it was it was.Really awesome to see you know we had we.Had a lot of the team present on pass.Keys and kind of run through workshops.And then and then you know have have.P Tyler's pasky kit and have a lot of.These teams kind of take that and and.Build things like by the next day and.That that was really awesome and so.You know as far as being a a soron.Narrative that was pretty cool so one of.The things I've had my hand in over the.Last year is trying to get.Stellar's representation on places.Like defi Lama and coin gecko like more.Prominent and more reflective of what.Actually is happening on the network and.If you look at like art tvl perhaps a.Vanity metric perhaps not but it shows.Like at least the utilization to some.Degree of what people are putting onto.The network if you look at def llama's.Tvl Soroban went main net on February.20th and at that time our tvl was.Like right around eight million or so.And a week later it doubles like.Overnight to 16 17 million and now we're.Like at 60.Million just like obviously smart.Contracts or something that the.Community was hungry for and we listened.And we did the thing and like.Surprisingly people are using it oh my.Gosh they said they wanted to use it and.They're gonna actually use it who knew. it's just so exciting to see it like.All the work that we put into it.Validated and actually going to like use.Cases going to do things that people are.Going to take advantage of and use yeah.And yeah it's awesome and like when we.Say to it's like the entire ecosystem.You know like I mean but so crucially .It's.Awesome all right we had a question.About eth Denver I don't want to.Scoop anybody so this isn't GNA be an.Announcement but there will be something.Really fun at e Denver this year is.What I will say and I think somebody.Did share the link it may involve.Cards there was chips yeah poker poker.Game was shared on the build on.Stellar Twitter. I don't know how to interpret risk.Level shark infested that's I don't know.But details dropping soon so stay tuned.We are not gonna scoop anybody right now.Are the sh gonna have.Lasers stayed we're not sure.Yet. and yeah I mean I think we can can.Maybe take some.Questions from chat if there are.Questions other questions.Or or comments or things that people are.Thinking about or things that you want.To see or things you want to do in.The.Ecosystem let us.Know or if you need an address to send.All your tokens to.B yeah I don't.Know I mean well I guess like what what.Does everybody think about about Dev do.Don. Bri is going on a very committed.Maybe that's a strong we'll have to.See no I mean like I loved running the.Dock found it was it was good it's .Yeah it's a good way to get.Documentation and get community and.Ecosystem involvement so which is are.All wonderful things but it's there is.Much.Overhead for administering a program.Like.That what will Tyler Tinker with next.Yeah that's a good.Question after pasy aren't the hot thing.Anymore are they gonna paskis are always.Goody yeah heard of AI.Agents I might I might I might be.Tinkering with that I like AI a lot and.I did a I did a coding with.Kale just talked about this anything but.AI on AI agents yeah anything but AI.Agent yep sorry Mattias why Tyler why am.I gonna work on AI because Matias.Doesn't want me to.Right I have a life mission AI agents.Because I really like the idea of making.Bots that can do things for me so that I.Don't have to this particularly with.Like blend here's my I here's my. my use case for what I'm trying to.Pursue I like blend a lot I really.Don't like claiming my emissions or.Rebalancing between the different fols. so I want to build a bot that that.Will handle all of that for me by.Reading inbound transactions or like.Reading the current state of all the.Pools reading the current state of my .Balances in the emissions pools .Seeing if it's time to try and move.Between different.Pools but I don't want to have to like.Manually do any of that and so I want to.Build an AI agent that can handle all.That for me so when you combine things.Like the smart wallets with the policy.Designers and AI agents I think you.Can pretty easily build some tools.That are in this case custom built to.Blend but would be pretty easy to.Customize for a bunch of different.Contracts you can think of I don't.Know kale or whatever where you could.Chat with it or you could just send it.Into some sort of Cron job where the.Prompts are data that's being fit in so.An AI prompt doesn't have to be like.Written English it can be like Json.Files or if you've got a parser right it.Could be xdr it could be a meta from a.Transaction that could then feed into.Some sort of.Outcome like rebalancing or filling.Orders I mean there's so many.Interesting things that could happen.When you combine these smart wallets.Which now you don't have to like have a.Human involved in signing things with.Policy signers so you don't have to.Worry about giving too much permission.To some third party service you can very.Tight bound what they're allowed to do.Only claim emmissions only for me only.On the blend protocol only for a certain.Amount of money in a certain period of.Time give that to an AI agent that can.Then interpret those rules know its.Limitations and start to act on those.Rules for the benefit of the user that.Type of stuff's really interesting to me.It's a lot of.Experimentation but that's Sly.Something I'm interested in working on.And then just more kale type of games so.I've got one of those that I'm working.On right now hopefully it'll be here.Sometime in quarter one. we'll.See you have another.Question how do you feel about well.Apparently according to Stellar.Expert if you if you hold just the.Tiniest amount of kale you're a.Billionaire so you could you could .Show her.That look at all the M all the money.We've.Made I'm still waiting for someone to.Actually start Market making between.Like fcm and kale or to create a whole.Separate Farmers Market I want someone.To make a farmers market because that's.So funny because we have like dexes and.Market makers and amm and all of these.Things like what's the most.Fundamental base Market you could have.From the dawn of time like a farmers.Market where I can sell my kale for.Chickens or ve other vegetables or.Coffee or you know someone's bead work.It's just asking to be turned into some.Sort of farmers market game.So should do that and then your.Imagination can run wild because we.We've also you know like we've been.Throwing around ideas that would be.Really cool to see like we have a.Marketplace we have a farmers's market.Could you pick up ingredients for you.Know really nice suit or I don't know.The best kind of suit virtual suit yeah.Exactly kale soup you know yeah I've.Been trying to convince Tyler that like.Leaf Kale like real kale is delicious is.A disgusting vegetable and only.For digital.Representation.Farming future contract somebody should.Make a Marketplace and somebody should.Make recipes for kale and other.Vegetables kale soup stand.How yeah I think I think Al building all.That like Marketplace it's it's a lot of.Fun it it's fun to play with but if we.Break it down we could actually spin off.A lot of cool sample projects to show.How this is built and and I think.There's a lot of educational value in in.Doing something like this it sounds.Super fun and it's like just having a.Good time here but but there's actually.A lot of learning that goes into.Building something like that that we can.That we can pass on to the community so.I think even though it sounds like fun.And crazy ideas that there's a lot of.Learning in it and there's a lot of.Knowledge to to be extracted from that.And I think that's that's that's going.To be one of our big jobs in 2025 is to.Take all these fun ideas and actually.Turn it into a knowledge and educational.Content so it's not just fun all of it.It's there's a meaning to all this we.Have talked a lot about doing fun stuff.Doing fun games doing fun in educational.Stuff and it's it's it's a it's learning.Should be.Fun yeah yeah it's a great Point like.The kale contract along with the fcm.Contract like there's actually a lot of.Really good learnings in there I mean I.I spent a lot of time when I was writing.That contract to make it really.Efficient so there are a lot of like .Very technical decisions that I made in.Order to keep the cost of using kale .Low so that it wouldn't overwhelm the.Network and drive up the cost of a lot.Of stuff but it could be this thing that.Could scale could get a lot of traction.But wouldn't affect the bottom line of.The network too much so there actually a.Lot of stuff in there that could be.Really useful for anybody building.Contracts to employ into maybe more.Serious use.Questions collaborations with other.Community nonprofits or.Dows I feel like it maybe a little bit.More on the ecosystem growth side.Yeah yeah we did partner with funding.The comments which is a big D for.Public kids yeah but definitely more.Of an question but yeah there are future.Plans.Yeah any other questions or ideas by the.Way yeah any spicy questions what what.Other.Jalapeno that's not a hot pepper like.Green pepper green.The hot take speed.Round I already gave.Mine g addresses aios am mikos the year.Of the SE.Address..J.J all growing in.2025 stay tuned stay tuned see we can't.Answer anything it's so.[Laughter].Boring you don't ask for.Question one more question where's the.Alpha oh you want some.Alpha.Tuned on I already dropped that we're.Going to be working on another fun. I think they're working on docs V3.Mer oh my.Gosh we're we're going to delete the.Docks everything's gonna be AI.Generated there's gonna be this .Automated person that talks to you and.Answers all your questions all live that.Would be wild though like you you go to.A doc site this is a person that like.Talks to you answers your questions hi.My name is what's that Iron Man.The Iron Man character that Jarvis.Jarvis hi I'm Jarvis how can I help you.Build sorond.Contract this is one for the year of the.C address could it be helpful for.Contracts to interact with the decks it.Could be helpful I don't I don't know.What the team is thinking about like the.G Toc compatibility question of gry how.Do those things interact there's lots of.Debate between the current ecosystem.With G addresses and the new growing.Ecosystem with C addresses it's a good.Question.Question but I don't think there's a.Whole lot of answers here yet until we.Start to see how the ecosystem adapts to.Smart wallets policy.Signers defi where the liquidity goes.How different markets pop up that maybe.Either take the place of the deck or.Move faster than the deck. there's definitely a lot of.Inter like you got toor on one side.Saying we're going to remove the decks.You've got people on the other side.Saying the deck is the and will never.Never go away so lots of lots of.Outstanding questions and ideas and.Can't just I don't know you can't just.Remove stuff there has to be better.Things to put in this place and that.Just takes time to develop and do the.Research for and see who your.Partners will be who would Implement.Those things and can help with the.Design and the implementation and use.Cases and the wallets so it's never been.A better time to build but there's also.A lot of outstanding questions for what.The future actually looks like.Questions about the future where is.Meridian G to.Be what team you think we're on that's.Not our.Team.Well I don't know there if there are.There is one more.Question speed.Yeah I'm not sure about the status on.That I know they're still talking about.Speedex types of Technology but I'm not.Sure where they currently are it's.Not not where I spend my time so I'm not.Sure there's still research happening.Towards it I think I do know that I.Don't think it's speedex related but.There are some caps that they've got.Open for like the next upcoming protocol.Releases and I think they're planning.On doing some of those meetings on.Discord so and then I'm not sure if.It'll be on stream to Twitch as well but.Keep an eye out for some of those it's a.Great place to kind of see where the.Core team is thinking.About some of these types of questions.Of where are we goingon to go next what.Updates do we need what's the what's.What's coming next for.Stell my one of my favorite Meridian.Highlights to answer ruger's question.Was watching Tyler's Hy presentation as.He talked to his pre-recording self.And said well thank you Tyler in his.Beautiful podcaster voice as he.Presented between his live demo and.His a lot of comments about that I don't.Feel like many of them they were like .Just underhanded like oh that was that.Was interesting choice of you to.Pre-record everything.Yeah maybe we'll try to do it live and.Then the internet will out and.Everyone will just be sitting there.Watching me fumble.And then we'll see who's laughing.The dev meeting back on.YouTube wait do we do Dev meetings on.YouTube oh like putting them up on.YouTube yeah yeah it is the we have.Actually started uploading it there's.A playlist on the.St St YouTube channel there playlist for.Us .Meetings and this one will come up.Shortly too so yes 2025 year of De.Meeting on YouTube.Oh yeah yeah the playlist is up right.Now but we are going to stream it as.That's the plan to stream it both on.Twitch and and YouTube at the same.Time there you.Go cool all right well thanks.Everyone oh best way to reach the core.Team get have discussions Google group.Or something else show up with the SF.Office on the door.DM DM kale no that will that will not.Work they're in Discord right A lot of.Them are in Discord again you don't you.Don't Pi the route that everybody else.Takes it's talking in Discord and asking.Specific questions. being clear I can always get the.Attention that you might work.All right cool yeah coming to you live.From the.Orus it's the never thanks everyone.Thank you we'll see you all around.
