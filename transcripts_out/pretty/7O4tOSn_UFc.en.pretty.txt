Hi and welcome to this week's Stella.Developer meeting.Today I'm going to.Talk about.Quickstart.So what is quickstart?
Well,.Quickart is a local Stellar network.Environment.So quickart is a docker.Image that bundles Stellar core with.Horizon RPC friendbot and a database.And quick start can run locally as.Either mainet, testn net, future net or.Or a customizable local.Network.Quick start is great for.Developers who want to test smart.Contracts, experiment with the Stella.Network, and learn about Stella's.Features in a control environment.And I.Can tell you that SDF engineers use.Quickart quite a bit.There are two different operational.Modes.There's ephemeral mode that.Cleans the database and start up with a.Default config at each startup.And then.There's persistent mode that mounts a.Volume on your local machine and persist.The database and the.Configurations.It's very easy to set up.Quick start.All you need is Stellar CLI.And Docker installed on your local.Machine and then you can use the CLI.Command Stellar network container start.To set up quick start on your local.Machine.In this case, we use a command.To set it up as test net.And when the.Quick start is set up, you can access.Test net with these settings.After this presentation, I'm going to.Give a quick intro to how to actually.Use it in practice.And two ways to use.It is to use Stellar Lab.You can connect. Stellar Lab to quick.Start or you can deploy a smart.Contract and you deploy it just like.You're used to.First, you set up in.This case we use the hello world.You.Set up the smart contract, you create an.Identity and you build the contract.And then you deploy the smart contract.But instead of deploying it to the test.Net or mainet or future net you deploy.It to your local quick start.In this case we use the.Local host as the RPC URL to tell.Stellar contract deploy command that we.Want to deploy it onto quick start.And.Once deployed we can invoke the smart.Contract just like we're used to when we.Have deployed it to test net or mainet.I want to put a little bit of focus on.The documentation here.If you want to.Know more in details how how quickart.Works and how to set it up, you can go.To our documentation, go to tools and go.To quick.Start.Here you'll find all the relevant.Information you will need.You can read.About how to get it set up, the network.Modes, how to work the the friendbot.Faucet, how to debug, and do some.Advanced settings that I'm not going to.Cover in this.Presentation.But let's try to to set it.Up on my local machine.Okay, so here we have the.Terminal.First, if you remember, we can.Use a command from the Stellar CLI to set.Up.Our our quick start.And in this case, I.Want to use a test net.And I just name.This quick start.Minet.And that was it.Now the quick.Start is up and running on my local.System.So let's go ahead and and build.A smart contract.Actually we'll use the.Hello world example.User.Let's call this a different name.That I have not used before.Call.It Frank.Okay, the hello world smart contract is.Now built and now we want to deploy it.Onto quick.As mentioned before, we can here.See that instead of instead of deploying.It to the actual test net or mainet, we.Specify the RPC URL here and we use the.The local.Host / RPC and the rest is as we usually.Use when we deploy to test.Net.Okay, so now we actually have the.Hello world smart contract deployed to.Quick.Next, what we want to do is to.Try to invoke.It and let's use the contract.ID was given us here.And it was successful.So as you can see.Here once we have set up quick start we.Can deploy our smart contracts to quick.Start and run it locally instead of.Running it on the test net or the mainet.The public ones and it works exactly the.Same.Way.Now let's try to.Connect Stellar Lab instead of using the.The terminal.I have still a lab in this window.The way you connect it to your your.Local quick start is you go up to the.Network selector here and instead of.Test net here you choose.Custom.I have already tried this.So.These fields are already populated.But the quick start URLs are localhost.At port 8000/ RPC for the RPC and.Horizon is just the local host at port.8000.And the network phrase is the same.As if we were using the public test net.So let's switch to the custom network.So now Stellar Lab is connected to our.Start and we can do everything we.Usually do when we're connected to.Either test net or mainet or future net.Let's just try to generate a key.Pair and we can fund it with.Friendbot.So this works exactly like if.You were connected to a test net.One.Thing to notice here is that usually if.You use testn net you will get a link to.Stellar expert so you can go and take a.Look at at your user account there..Obviously we can't do that because our.Cell explorer is not looking at.Our local quick start but otherwise.It works exactly like if we were working.On the public test.I hope this little introduction to.Quick start was useful.If you have any.Questions feel free to ask. you can.Ask in in Discord.I know there's a.Lot of quick start users in in Discord.As well.But hopefully this will give.You an a a great tool to work with .For these special requirements where.Maybe you want to use some locking.There's some great locking features .With quick start.So go explore it.Go.Take a look at the documentation and see.How this can be useful for you.Thank.You for joining.
