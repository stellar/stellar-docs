Justin rice I'm the vp of the ecosystem.At the Stellar development foundation .Where I work with people to understand.How to use the network developers and.Enterprises and at the SDF our goal is.To support the open source open.Participation Stellar network of which.You will hear a lot about in a minute in.Order to.Increase equitable access to the world's.Financial infrastructure.Marta hello and yeah I'm martha lakova.I'm a software engineer on the Stellar.Core team.At cell development foundation and so i.Work on the actual implementation of a.Distributed ledger which is what powers.The Stellar network so really excited.To be here with you.We ready all right we are going to dive.In this is going to be a fairly in-depth.Explanation of Stellar and of the.Blockchain technology that powers it .We're going to talk for a while I'm.Going to talk for a while hand it to.Marta and then we'll probably pause.About halfway through for questions.And then we'll sort of dig roll up our.Sleeves and sort of do a little bit of.Playing around with the actual network.So.Technical deep dive interstellar.Quick agenda i'll explain how the.Stellar network works I guess I just.Sort of went through this give it to.Marta to talk about how it compares to.Other blockchains and then we will talk.About sort of open source and an open.Source project and then we'll use the.Stellar laboratory and leave some time.For q a okay.The Stellar network.The Stellar network is made up of nodes.Nodes.Nodes nodes what are nodes.Nodes are computers that connect and.Communicate with one another to keep a.Common accounting ledger and to approve.And ratify changes to it so on the image.On the right all those dots those are.Stellar's open participation so anyone.Can spin up one of these nodes and they.Run this thing called Stellar core that.Marta helps build.It's decentralized because these nodes.Are run by independent individuals and.Organizations all over the globe so each.Of those dots is a computer running.Style according to community. the common ledger that nodes work.Together to keep it's stable.Physics major in the.College nice and you guys are all.Students can you please mute your.Microphones thank you I thought that was.Like a like just like coming in hot with.A question at the top.And I would I approved that .That level of verve and engagement .Okay.Ledger understanding the ledger so i.Said that knowns work to keep a common.Ledger it's stable it's secure it's.Transparent stable because the network.Is spread over a bunch of servers and.Computers all over the world so you.Can't turn it off there's not a central.Server it's secure because the ledger.Entries are immutable right once a.Transaction has been processed no one.Can change the data or manipulate the.Numbers to their liking and it's.Transparent because like many.Blockchains like all black public.Blockchains.Everyone can see the ledger and trust.That the information is correct.That's the ledger so.Nodes keep the ledger and what's on the.Ledger well.Accounts.Accounts accounts accounts accounts are.The essential data structure in Stellar.They are saved on this global ledger .They hold balances they sign.Transactions they also issue assets.And account access is controlled by.Public private key cryptography so every.Stellar account has a public key usually.They start with g.And every account also has a secret key.Which always starts with an s the public.Key is safe to share right that's how.People identify your account so they.Verify you authorize the transaction.It's kind of like your email address.People need to know it to send you an.Email.That reference feels probably dated to.Many of you.Your secret key however is private.Information that proves that you own.Your account it's like your password.Can't share with anybody you use your.Secret key to sign transactions which.Essentially call functions that change.The state of the ledger so transactions.That's the next word transactions.Transactions transactions.Transactions on Stellar are made up of.Operations which are the actual.Functions that change the ledger so a.Payment that's an operation offered to.Buy an asset to sell an asset that is an.Operation.Now this is Stellar vernacular here it's.A little confusing because operations.Honestly that's what most people think.Of when they think of transactions but.On Stellar you can actually bundle 100.Operations.Into a single transaction you can put.Them in a specific order they execute in.That order.You can use that to do some interesting.Things we won't get into it right now.But when I say operations you can kind.Of think transactions.Most transactions in fact consist of a.Single operation .Each of the entries that you see in this.Example ledger that's a single operation.Transaction so lisa sends me fifty.Dollars thank you lisa.Transactions are time stamped. and they contain unique identifying.Information and every three to five.Seconds those nodes that we talked about.Earlier they bundle all the transactions.Together into a set they apply that set.To change the state of the ledger let us.Walk through that process so it all.Starts with a ledger which is again is.Essentially a list of accounts and.Balances it's like a giant spreadsheet.And a sql database.Users wherever they are in the world.They submit transactions to send and.Exchange assets on the network some of.These are individual users with Stellar.Wallets some of these are businesses.Using making b2b payments.And using Stellar they can move funds.Anywhere in the world they can convert.Currency along the way thanks to a.Built-in system of exchange that.Includes order books and automated.Market makers which we will talk about.Later. these transactions are essentially.Bundled into sets they're confirmed by.Validating nodes they are applied to the.Ledger at which point they're final and.Create an immutable record and then the.Whole process starts over.So why is a blockchain ledger immutable.Why can't someone change the previous.Entries on the ledger how do these.Transaction sets come together and get.Finalized anyway to answer those.Questions I'm going to pass the mic to.Marta who's going to dig in and explain.How blockchain protocols work generally.And also how the Stellar consensus.Protocol works specifically marta.Hello justin thank you always great to.Hear you talk about these things so .Yeah so let's dive a bit deeper into .Technical aspects of the Stellar network.And the Stellar consensus protocol in.Particular so to do this we're going to.Put things into perspective we're going.To compare Stellar to two biggest.Blockchains out there bitcoin and.Ethereum.So let's start with the intended.Function of these three blockchains so.Bitcoin was the first blockchain to show.A decentralized completely native.Store of value a completely internet.Native store of value excuse me so we.Think of it as the first internet native.Money.Recently more and more people have been.Referring to.Bitcoin as digital gold due to its.Scarcity and potentially a way to beat.Inflation but in this talk which is.Going to focus on kind of the initial .Goal of bitcoin as outlined in the.Bitcoin paper which is digital money.On the other hand.Ethereum acts as a general purpose.Decentralized computer so what I mean.Here is that it provides infrastructure.For developers to write programs or.Smart contracts that can really execute.Anything.So this allows a variety of different.Applications on the ethereum network so.Things like nfts or borrowing lending.Applications asset issuance and so forth.And so finally Stellar focuses on.Payments so Stellar is really good for.Fast and cheap payments as well as.Issuing digital assets on the network.For example on Stellar you can issue.Stable coins such as usdc.So next let's compare consensus.Mechanisms for each of these blockchains.So bitcoin and ethereum both use.Proof-of-work.Which we're going to discuss in a lot.More detail in the next slide but for.Now I also wanted to know that ethereum.Is actually.In the process of a major upgrade as.They're moving away from proof of work.Towards proof of stake.So while the intended.Proof of stake model actually has some.Better properties when it comes to.Securities and scalability in this.Talk we'll mostly focus on the current.State of ethereum.And then so for seller it actually.Used a completely different approach to.Consensus specifically it uses federated.Byzantine agreement which is implemented.Via the Stellar consensus protocol to.Achieve consensus.So let's actually dive a little deeper.And.Try to understand what different.Differentiates all these consensus.Mechanisms.So first I just want to kind of step.Back and emphasize that a consensus.Mechanism is vital for the security of.The blockchain it is essentially what.Allows all the nodes on the blockchain.To agree on something in a safe way.If nodes don't agree on transaction in a.Safe way it opens up a possibility for.Double spend attack.So a double spend attack is essentially.Spending the same money twice a quick.Example here imagine paying five dollars.For parking but then spending the same.Five dollars to buy an ice cream so you.Received the goods for a total of value.Of ten dollars meaning that you got the.Parking space time and you got an ice.Cream yet you only paid five dollars for.Everything so consensus mechanisms want.To ensure that.Such a scenario can happen.So now let's dive a little deeper into.What a proof-of-work system is.So to reach consensus nodes need to.Agree on transactions to confirm in the.Next block.In proof-of-work systems each validator.Solves a very difficult math problem.That requires a lot of computational.Resources it is also proven that.There's no shortcuts to the solution so.The only way to get to the right answer.Is to actually perform the computation.I.e show the proof of work.So validators.The first validator that solves that.Problem essentially gets to create the.And then validators that create creates.That block they broadcast it to everyone.Else on a network.So as other nodes on the network.Discover the new block they basically.Accept it.Since it's it's essentially a longer.Chain and then once they accept it they.Can start working on the next block on.Top of that newly created block.So here again I want to kind of.Emphasize that validators on the network.Accept the longest chain so.If the validator is first to mine the.Block it basically creates that longer.Chain that is later discovered and.Accepted by others.So another thing about proof-of-work is.That validators are incentivized to.Participate in the block creation that.We just discussed because they receive.Monetary rewards in the form of coins.For producing these new blocks and you.Might have heard about about this this.Process is called mining and it's very.Popular.So now let's shift gears a little bit.And talk about how Stellar approaches.Consensus it's actually a completely.Different consensus mechanism because.There are no computationally heavy tasks.So instead nodes select other nodes on a.Network that they trust.And they exchange messages with those.Nodes to agree on a set of transactions.To confirm in a particular block and we.Call these sets of trusted nodes quorum.Slices so.Let's unpack what quorum slices actually.Mean.So to understand how consensus is.Reached on Stellar let's first look at.The examples of these quantum slices.That we just discussed so recall that a.Quorum slice is a set of nodes that a.Validator chooses to trust.On the right we have a network of four.Nodes a b c and d and we express trust.Relationship between these nodes.With arrows so for example a has b and c.In its quorum slice.And another example is node b it has a c.And d in its quorum slice.So now that we know what quorum slices.Are let's define quorum.Quorum is a non-empty set of nodes that.Contains a slice for each member so for.Example a b and c is not a quorum why.Well because it actually does not.Contain a slice full slice for b and c.If you look at the diagram.So you see that d is in the quorum slice.For both b and c.So it must be in the form on the other.Hand a b c and d is a quorum because it.Includes a slice for each member.And forms are the key detail of.Consensus on Stellar is that network the.Network only confirms a block if a.Quorum agrees on that block so it needs.The agreement of a whole quorum to.Confirm the transactions.Great so now that we've talked a little.Bit about consensus let's switch to.Open participation so.What does it mean to have open.Participation.It means that there's no central.Authority allowing or preventing you.From participating on the network.Meaning that anyone can join and start.Validating transactions and.Participating in consensus and we wanted.To include this feature because it's.Just so vital for decentralization as.And as you can see all three networks.Have that but we thought it was.Important to include this feature as.Well.All right cool so next we have some.Key security properties to go over so as.You can see bitcoin and ethereum prefer.Liveness and Stellar prefers safety and.You're probably very confused because i.Haven't defined either liveness or.Safety so we're going to unpack this.So we're not going to spend too much.Time on the actual computer science.Theory here but the most important.Important point that I want to convey is.That there are three desired properties.That consensus mechanisms always want to.Have so.Those are safety liveness and full.Tolerance what do they mean.So safety is a guarantee that all nodes.Produce the same block the same valid.Block meaning that nodes can't produce.Contradicting block blocks aliveness.Guarantees that nodes will eventually.Produce a new block and won't just hold.And you know be not being unresponsive.And then finally fault tolerance ensures.That the network can tolerate node.Failure so either nodes going down or.Actually becoming malicious and sending.Like conflicting messages to other nodes.So in distributed systems it is proven.That you can only have two out of three.Of these properties and typically.Consensus protocols always want to.Guarantee fault tolerance.And because consensus protocols select.Fault tolerance they're left with.Deciding between safety and lightness so.What exactly happens when either safety.Or liveness are selected.So if we choose safety which guarantees.That all nodes will produce the same.Block.Nodes will get stuck until they can they.Can all produce the same block remember.Safety means that nodes can't produce.Differing blocks.If we choose liveness nodes choose to.Produce a blog any blog.Meaning that they choose to stay alive.But they may produce a block that will.Later be overridden by a different block.As network advances in consensus.So this this potentially invalid block.Is actually what can open up a.Possibility for a a double spend attack.And we'll look into example of this.A little bit closer in the next slide as.Yeah so let's see a visual example of.How liveness is picked over safety so.Here yeah each clipboard icon basically.Represents a block and.So as new blocks are propagated on the.Network.Nodes can learn about it at different.Speeds so it's actually possible for two.Blocks on the network to have a.Different view of the blockchain.So remember how nodes choose to follow.The longest chain in proof-of-work.Systems.But what if some nodes haven't learned.About the longer chain yet so they.Continue to follow the chain that.They currently consider the longest and.This is how you can end up with a.Different view of the blockchain as we.Try to show in in this example.So on the other hand let's look at the.Network that prefers safety over.Liveness which is what Stellar consensus.Protocol does so the important thing to.Realize here is that a split that we had.In proof of work systems can actually.Never happen because Stellar consensus.Protocol prefers or chooses safety over.Liveness so instead.Nodes hold if they can't agree on the.Same block.So if there is no quorum.That agrees on a particular block nodes.Just hold and stop processing.Transactions.So we just covered some important.Security properties.Let's actually see how long it takes to.Confirm a transaction on these.Blockchains so every bitcoin block takes.About 10 minutes while ethereum.Blocks block is about 13 seconds note.That we also included the number of.Confirmations needed to consider the.Transaction final and this data is .From from coinbase.So remember that in.Proof-of-work systems nodes continue.Producing blocks and as they discover.Newer blocks on the network they might.Switch to a longer chain potentially.Abandoning the previous chain they.Considered longest so because of this we.Typically want to wait for the.Network to confirm several blocks.After your transaction made it into a.Block so.And this is needed to reduce the chances.Of the network switching to another.Longer.Chain.And so on coinbase .As you see in it in a in a table.Users wait for three confirmations .For a bitcoin transactions and on.Ethereum it's a 35 confirmations.This is completely different on Stellar. there's actually no need to wait.Because.Exactly because of the feature that we.Just described in the previous slide.Where Stellar prefers safety over.Liveness.So because the agreement of the whole.Quorum is needed in order to produce a.Block once a block is produced.Operators can be sure that the block.Won't later be revoked so once it's.Confirmed it's confirmed.And on Stellar.A block is produced every five seconds.Only one confirmation is needed to deem.The transaction final.Exactly for the reasons that we just.Described.Okay so now let's also.Look at the average transaction cost so.Again we averaged the data over the past.12 months.As you can see it's quite different acro.Across these networks and I just.Also wanted to kind of point out that .This fees fluctuate is they depend a lot.On how much competition there is for.A particular transaction to be included.In the block but kind of the most.Important point that that I want to make.Here is that is the order of magnitude.Difference between Stellar and these.Other networks despite the fact that.These fees fluctuate.All right so.Now let's talk about sustainability. so as you can see proof-of-work.Systems require high energy consumption. and energy consumption on Stellar is.Quite low and why is.That so remember how we said that in.Proof-of-work systems nodes try to solve.A heavy computational task as fast as.They can.So this is directly related to energy.Impact so heavy computational tasks.Require a lot of cpu.Which in turn requires a lot of power.And in proof-of-work systems.Validators are essentially incentivized.To have high quality hardware that uses.A lot of power in order to increase.Their chances of producing the next.This is different on Stellar so because.Stellar does not require computationally.Intensive operations to reach consensus.And instead it has.Nodes establish trust relationship with.Each other and just exchange messages to.Reach consensus.This can actually be done on the very.Modest hardware and it does not require.A lot of power.All right so we just talked a lot about.A lot of things and the final feature.That I want to talk about is resistance.To 51 attacks so what are these attacks. so again remember that proof of work.Systems nodes that solve a.Computationally heavy task they get to.Produce the next block.So this is also directly related to how.Much computational power a validator has.If a validator has a lot of.Computational power it is more likely to.Win the block race and have the network.Accept that block.This means that if validators.With over 50 percent of the computing.Power become malicious they have the.Ability to take over the network and.Dictate every subsequent block.So as an example if a top few miners in.A bitcoin network colluded or.For example a large government felt.Threatened by bitcoin and invested a lot.Of resources into mining rigs the.Network could be taken over.So on Stellar such an attack is not.Possible because computing power is not.A feature of consensus.On Stellar nodes choose other nodes that.They trust to decide which transactions.To confirm in the blog.Nodes do not accept the block based on.Computational power so this means that.Even if an attacker adds a million nodes.To the network this will not impact.Consensus as long as nodes in network do.Not add those malicious nodes to the.Quorum slices.And so usually nodes on Stellar add.Organizations that they trust to the.Aquarium slices so this means an.Attacker will need to convince other.To you know on the network to add.Attackers nodes to the quorum sizes.Which.Can be difficult.All right great so to summarize the.Stellar consensus protocol is a.Federated byzantine agreement which.Allows for open membership to support.Growing decentralization.It has low latency which allows fast.Transaction times.It is resistant to malicious actors and.51 attacks and it prefers safety over.Liveness to prevent forks.And I know I just said a bunch of things.I'm going to stop here and see if there.Are any questions before giving back to.Justin.Any takers any questions about consensus.Protocols about the Stellar consensus.Protocol.I'm always thinking that.I trip over federated byzantine.Agreement system sometime and I'm like.Oh we should.I want to call proof of vote or.Something.That's not a question shy students if.You have questions sometimes they put.Them in the chat too marta oh yeah.Right we can do chat as well oh somebody.Really encourage you guys to ask.Questions.Yes yeah hi I was wondering if so if.When you're talking about security or.Safety versus liveness like how does.Seller have low isn't that what's the.Benefit of live of like liveliness if.The speed for transactions is still.Faster on like Stellar like why would.Anyone choose to value liveliness. I think it's just that those.Consensus protocols are like completely.Different like so on Stellar for.Example yeah you prefer safety but then.You have to also select your quorum set.Correctly and make sure that it's.Actually configured correctly which can.Be sometimes like difficult and so like.You know on this proof of work systems i.Think that's just like a feature of.Consensus .Yeah because you know this.You can basically have like.Multiple chains at the same time and.Because it's a distributed system and.You know these computers need to learn.About these different chains on the.Proof of work system then they can.Have like a partial view .Of the network at the time so.I I'm not sure that .Well you know one thing I sometimes.Think about with Stellar is like the.Validators on the network are known.Entities so as smart to point it out.Like they have to trust one another they.Have to.Opt into adding entities to their quorum.Set they know who those people are.And so when you value.Safe safety right if the network.Halts what that means is that.Remember it's a decentralized network.Nobody has the ability to turn it off no.One can just turn it back on either.Right like you actually have to.Coordinate validators if a network holds.And so I almost also think that like one.Feature one necessity for like a network.That does value safety over liveness is.That validators have to be able to find.One another right to restart the network.If something goes wrong and I think on a.Lot of like in in networks that are.Proof of work where miners are basically.Like anonymous..I don't even know if that would be.Possible.Yeah and I think like because Stellar.Was designed for payments like it was.Really important then if you know if.Something happens like some kind of.Split on the network like everybody just.Stops you know there's there's no.Kind of forking and continuing to.Different views of the world if.Nobody can agree on one view of the.World everybody just holds so it's kind.Of like a important feature given how.The network is used you know like for.Payments for cross-border payments .And like assets.Thank you marta that was awesome all.Right I'm going.Okay I'm picking it up and I'm talking.About open source contribution so.All of that that martin talked about is.Super awesome that is there is a code.Base that sort of all these nodes run.That allow them to run to sort of.Talk to one another to vote to come to.Consensus to ratify transactions.And a fundamental ethos behind the.Development of that code base and it's.Part of what makes me love SDF is that.It's open source right anyone can review.The code anyone can contribute to the.Code no one owes the owns the code right.It's open it's free it's participatory.You listening can join the good fight.Today you can work on the code all you.Need is a github account. there's a wide world of innovative.Stellar developers and while many of.Them are focused on building their own.Apps and services that make use of the.Network which we'll talk about in a.Second the sort of application layer.Many are also contributing to helping.Evolve the software that powers the.Network itself.And that software that powers the.Network it never sits still it's.Constantly being iterated improved on.Worked on in order to fulfill the needs.Of the ecosystem including all the.Projects that are built to the.Application level.So here's a question if you have this.Code base and it's evolving and no one.Owns it well how does it evolve and I'm.Going to talk about that quickly two.Main ways.Core advancement proposals and Stellar.Ecosystem proposals bear with me here.Court advancement proposals caps this is.A method that we sort of came up with.The foundation actually I don't even.Know who started it but at this point it.Is a codified process to allow.Contribution to come in and amend and.Update the code that runs Stellar core.That martin talked about so coordinates.My proposals they're suggested changes.To the protocol of Stellar they have a.Direct effect on how the network.Operates they're about 40 plus of.Them.Each one outlines a specific change and.They're used to add new features to the.Network itself so a recent example is.One called feedback transactions which.Allows fees to be paid by any account on.The network and it enables an.Application to cover its users.Transaction fees now network fees are.Handled at the protocol level so this.New feature it required a new operation.To be built into the protocol and that's.Why it had to be implemented in Stellar.Core and that's why it was a cap.According proposal.Had to be done that one incidentally we.Just added automated market making.Functionality to Stellar core CAP 38.I'm not gonna get into it right now but.It was super cool.Two weeks ago. so caps they have a life cycle right.It's it's it's a multi-step process to.Ensure it's high quality and backwards.Compatible for CAP to be qualified.Classified as final and go live on the.Network it has to go through all these.Stages has to be implemented in the code.But then fundamentally before it.Actually hits the network it has to be.Accepted by a majority of the network.Validators validators vote on the.Protocol number the network runs using.The same Stellar consensus protocol they.Use to ratify transactions so governance.Wise anyone can contribute to code.Code can be implemented but before it is.Actually adopted the network has to give.It the thumbs up.Now that's different that count process.Is different than the other kinds of.Standards that live outside of the.Stellar code Stellar eco system.Proposals seps for short these deal with.Changes to the standards and methods.Used to build on top of the network.Again there are 40 plus of these for.Various purposes they're labeled by.Numbers.These don't alter the Stellar code but.They are technical blueprints that allow.Developers to agree on how services.Using the network should be implemented.To allow for maximum interoperability.So basically a lot of the times these.Say here's how to set up an extra.Network api.There they detail like sort of two sides.Of an interaction server side how to.Create the api the client side how to.Consume the api .Again they also follow a a a life cycle.From draft to final.I'm going to give you an example so this.Is less abstract step 31 is a standard.That allows businesses to make compliant.Cross-border payments on behalf of two.Users so imagine a user wants to make a.Traditional remittance payment right.They log into admittance providers.Website they provide funds and they.Enter information about the recipient.And they want to have the money just.Show up in the recipients account they.Don't even know they're using Stellar.But they're working with companies that.Have integrated Stellar on the back end.So to complete the to complete the.Transaction and comply with regulations.The remittance provider they actually.Need to know the recipient's bank.Account and routing number and they need.To collect kyc information about the.Recipient.And to do all that they're receiving and.They need to share it with the receiving.Party right so. there isn't a direct path between two.Yet user Stellar account on network and.So instead the anchors.Will create use a SEP to create these.Extra network apis that allow them to.Share kyc information.Okay that was sort of a lot again that.Was the code marta talked about the.Actual consensus protocol those two.Things steps and caps were the ways that.The code evolves.But in truth.Interacting with Stellar is actually.Quite simple and because we're actually.Going to move way up the stack now so.Most developers who are building on.Stellar they aren't necessarily working.Caps or seps they aren't necessarily.Thinking about the protocol level or.Interacting with Stellar core in the raw.Every day they're using an SDK a.Software development kit in their.Preferred language and those sdks are.Interacting with a network api called.Horizon.So this three-tiered stack of.Responsibilities it sort of divides.Things so that each piece of software.Can focus on its specific purpose right.Stellar core concentrates on transaction.Submission and consensus.Horizon provides an ergonomic interface.To allow people to submit to to actually.Interact with the network and sdks kind.Of abstract away the complexity in a.Variety of different languages.So when you're developing on Stellar you.Can for the most part kind of not think.About what's going on in the hood at.Least not all the time and you can just.Use an intuitive rest api to submit.Transactions query network data.It's actually pretty cool.But again that feels a bit.Abstract so let's make it concrete .We actually have a thing called the.Stellar laboratory this is a handy tool.That you can use to build sign and.Submit transactions to the network and.You can use it to query all the api.Endpoints. and to understand what that means and.How to use it we're going to do.Something quickly right now I hope this.Works we're going to issue an asset so.We're going to do it on the test net.Which is the development sandbox for.Stellar it's just like the main public.Network but it's not connected to.Real-world money so this is the process.For issuing an asset.On the test net it would be the same for.The real network quick overview okay and.Issuing an asset requires a number of.Steps and the basic way to do this which.Is covered in the developer docs the.Easiest way to do this is to create two.Accounts one is an issuing account and.One is a distribution account because in.Order to issue an asset on Stellar one.Account has to trust the other to give.It the asset and then that account has.To make the payment this might seem.Weird but you'll see what it looks like.In action and so I'm going to now.Open Stellar laboratory let's see.Are you seeing Stellar laboratory.Okay this is Stellar laboratory and as.You can see it's on the test network.I first want to create two.New.Stellar accounts so this is what we will.Call the issuing account.It's really crazy.And then because in real life you would.Need to actually fund this every Stellar.Account requires a minimum balance of.Lumens in order to exist on the ledger.To prevent spam in real life you'd have.To fund it with real lumens but again.We're on the test network so I can just.Get test network lumens now this account.Has its minimum balance that is my.Issuing account I'm generating a second.Account this would be the distribution.Account.Saving these on a.Handy spreadsheet in reality you would.Be very careful with these keys. and again i've.Generated that key pair.That I need to fund it and so.Again this is Stellar laboratory and.What i've just done is created two new.Accounts but as you can see up here at.The top there's all these different tabs.That you can use to actually.Understand what's going on on the seller.Network you can actually build sign.Submit transaction and explore endpoints.So to start with we're just going to.Build a couple of transactions and what.We're essentially doing is we're taking.That second account that we created.Which is the distribution account.I'm adding it here I say fetch the next.Sequence number I set the fee.I'm not going to worry about time.Balance but this is me constructing a.Transaction and the operation type is.Going to be change trust.So to change trust I'm going to.Basically.Believe in an asset that exists called.You shy that is actually issued by the.Issuing account so again what I'm doing.Here is with the distribution account.I'm trusting the issuer account for an.Asset called you shy I'm basically.Going to see that I have generated the.Right transaction envelope.And I'm going to sign this in the.Transaction signer.Let's hope this works.So I need for that I need the secret key.If you recall I need the secret key of.The.And then I can submit the transaction in.The transactions.This is a three to five seconds as you.Can see I submitted the transaction and.The transaction is complete again this.Interface you can use to sort of create.Any kind of transaction I'm going to do.One more transaction really quickly.Which is basically with the issuing.I'm going to make a payment.So I'm putting in the issuing account.Now I'm fetching the next sequence.Number.I'm going to create a payment operation.This always makes me nervous.And I'm going to send it to that.Distribution account.Here is a distribution account.I'm going to send I don't know 13 13 13.Not many.Again I can sign.This with the public key for the issuing.So again this all feels a bit strange.But I'm going to wrap it all together so.Nicely in the end.And once I sign it.I can submit the transaction let's hope.It works.Transaction submitted okay.So what I just did was that I basically.Created two accounts one is a issuing.Account that actually creates and sends.The asset in a distribution account the.Distribution account essentially linked.To the issuing account and said I trust.You to send me an asset and the issuing.Account made a payment to the .Distribution account and now that.Account will hold a balance of the asset.And that was basically we just issued an.Asset on seller you can issue any asset.That represents anything with any asset.Code and it's just as simple as that.Just a few things that you can do in.This interface.Or you can do it with an SDK now one.Final thing as I mentioned horizon is an.Endpoint.I mean is that api that has different.Endpoints and this .Interface the Stellar laboratory will.Actually show you how to construct.Various queries to the horizon endpoints.So right now if I go to horizon and i.Sort of query the.Distribution account what it should have.Is a balance of this asset that we just.Created.Oops.So I'm going to put it here.And you will see that in fact if i.Scroll down to the json response.That.It does have a balance of this huge shy.Asset.What I essentially did was issue into.This account a new asset that never.Existed before on the ledger now part of.What's cool is that this actually.Happened on a test network that.Replicates the real network and all of.That payment all that issuance was.Actually done on multiple nodes and now.I'm going to open just like a totally.Different thing this.Stellar expert is a block explorer for. the Stellar network it's not.Something that we built it's not.Something we maintain it's actually.Maintained by a company in in ukraine.Right and this is basically a way to.View actions on the Stellar network and.I can it's set up to view the test.Network so I can actually go to a.Totally different third-party interface.I can look up the key right and I can.See that oh look there is.The public key there's the asset that it.Issued there's its balance here are the.Transaction history here's what we just.Did and like this is sort of the way.That it fundamentally works is that.Using this api you can create issue you.Can create payments.Make payments issue assets and all of.That activity is actually done on this.Sort of like common blockchain that you.Can view from almost any other source.And so that is.Asset issuance on.Now I accidentally stopped sharing my.Presentation.Sorry.Is there more to do here..And so there you go those those features.Right the ability to issue assets that.Allow you to build an interoperable.World because all kinds of companies or.Single devs can sort of build issue.Assets build interfaces that connect to.The blockchain.And it is very easy to get started right.Stellar again supports common.Development languages javascript and.Python there's extensive documentation.Developers can build and operate on the.With very few resources and there is.This test network and we have great.Documentation which you can find at.Developers.steller.org.So for anyone who is sort of here and.Wants to build on Stellar you can get.Started immediately.I guess the final thing that I do want.To say oh no there's way more .The next thing that I want to say is.That also if you're interested in.Learning more about Stellar and doing.Some hands-on stuff with that laboratory.I would suggest that you go to.Quest.Stellar.org.And after signing up with discord and.Your albedo wallet you can basically.Compete in quests to win an nft badge.Several times a year there are live.Series where you can compete this is.Basically a gamified intro Stellar that.Lets you learn if you're going to do it.I'd recommend starting with the practice.Quests start with quest one and.You'll need to create an account like i.Just did and then it will sort of walk.You through processes that you need to.The resources that you need to complete.The quest.And you'll get a set of keys and once.You submit the right transactions and.You can use that Stellar laboratory.Interface you can basically verify your.Solution claim an nft.It's super fun even if you don't know.How to code because you can use that.Interface and if you run into issues you.Can always ask questions in our vibrant.Community we have a discord server of.Stellar clusters. and actually that was it so if you.Want to find out more about Stellar .Go to `stellar.org` again I recommend.Using.Stellar quest to keep learning.And that was a fairly deep dive so again.It was we looked at scp we looked at the.Stellar stack we looked at basically the.Interface and how you can issue an asset.And then finally.Stellar quest the gamified way to learn.More about Stellar and now.We will open it up for questions.
