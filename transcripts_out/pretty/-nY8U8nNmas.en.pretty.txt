Hi and welcome to this week's Stella.Developer meeting with me in the studio.Here.Today I have Fernando from dop.Protocol and I can't exactly remember.When I heard about dop protocol for the.First time but I do remember I noticed.That my feeds in all social media like.LinkedIn X anywhere this company just.Started to pop up and there was articles.And they were going to conferences and I.Just just got really curious about.What's up with these guys what are they.Doing so and and of course they were.Attacking Stellar in everything they.Were doing being awesome ambassadors.So.I started to to read a little bit up on.What they're doing and since then I've.Had the pleasure of meeting the the.Whole team several times um last last.Time actually this week uh in Silicon.Valley where I met Oscar but uh met the.Team also at Meridian uh many other.Places.So I think it's a great.Opportunity to have them here in the.Studio and and hear what they're up to,.What they're doing and and share with.The rest of the community.So welcome.Fernando and thank you for joining.Today.&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for the invitation Ken.I'm pleasure to be here.Um so should I.Just now continue with the presentation?
Just now continue with the presentation?
Just now continue with the presentation?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe maybe just uh just tell a.&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe maybe just uh just tell a.Little bit about um who you are, how.Long how long time you've been working.On protocol.&gt;&gt; A bit of an introduction.Uh I'm.Fernando Castillo.I'm currently the CTO.Of DOP protocol, one of the co-founders.And um.Our main goal uh now with the protocol.Is to.Be able to all of the infrastructure.That's not being funded uh to get funded.Uh by decentralized means.And uh now in.This presentation.Uh hopefully I'm going to show a way on.How we can do that with uh doken studio.And with the other tools we've been.Developing.So um first um yeah what's the team a.Bit of also an introduction.Uh car and already mentioned Oscar he's.Our CEO he's currently at uh Silicon.Valley uh doing the embark pro program.With Deron University in conjunction.With Stellar.Um also we have Simone Spinola who's our.Operation and business uh officer and.Myself as I said already and also as a.Side note I'm finishing my PhD until.Berlin now I'm in Germany currently so.It's a bit uh late for me now it's 10.P.m.But I'm happy to be here and uh.Yeah so what's the the problem that we.Are facing is that in Latin America.There are a lot of infrastructure.Operators that are lacking fund and they.Struggle to to scale because on.Traditional banking systems the they.Require to go to to ask to the bank to.Then request for a loan then go through.All the bureaucracy of the bank.Uh but.Uh then also time moves and they need.The the money to deploy and to uh create.This new infrastructure that is not.Risky by itself but maybe the banks.Consider is risky because of the type of.Size of the company maybe or the type of.Emerging market.So it's but it's not.That the business business itself of.That infrastructure is um non um.Investable or that it will give money uh.Returns.So as I was saying uh let's imagine that.You are Mariano you are trying to get a.Traditional credit a loan for for a.Bank.uh but this uh depending on the.Country also for example we've recently.Seen in Argentina how this uh country.Was facing high inflation rates or.Similar situation with Venezuela.And other countries in Latin America.With high inflation rates that then uh.This ties those loans to higher interest.Rates plus the the risk on the country.Itself.Uh so uh there's this problem of banks.Uh because of these situations not uh.Giving beneficial loans to.Uh to these infrastructure operators and.At the same time uh if the.Infrastructure operator would uh go for.Example for a crowdfunding or a regular.Crowdfunding uh solution where they.Could go online and then they could say.Okay um let's get all of these people.Request this this uh this amount of.Money.I don't know, let's ask for $100.Uh,000.So we can build this power grid uh based.On on solar uh power.Then how then this.Operator could uh return or distribute.The revenue that this energy production.Is generating?
Is generating?
Is generating?
Uh and how could they do it in a trust.Uh and how could they do it in a trust.Um trustworthy fashion.So all of the uh.All of the people that were investing or.Supporting the project.Um can can give the the the money back.Or the the investment.And just as a.Parenthesis uh latam infra operators are.Latin American infrastructure operators.They are for example uh medium to small.Companies.Um that have this infrastructure.Projects.For example, a small or not so.Small but maybe a few kilowatts.Or 100 kilowatts of uh um power into.Injecting into the energy grid.for.Example, a solar base or holic.Or there could be other type of.Infrastructure for example uh a data.Center or any type of infrastructure.That's not uh relying on a on a big.Company because big companies.Uh they wouldn't have this type of.Problem to to access uh credits or loans.From banks.Uh so in our or what are we proposing as.A solution we have this separated in in.Four steps.One is to provide uh a tool.For the operator.To hand uh out verifiable data from.Their existing.Uh company or projects.So they can for.Example uh validate okay this um solar.Solar cell is going to produce uh this.Amount of energy because it has this.Specifications.Um I can I have already bought them for.This price or I have this uh revenue.Evidence for similar.Uh infrastructure.Uh pictures or proof of location for.Example for where is it installed the.The infrastructure.And that that's the first part of okay.How can we give some some.Uh due diligence for example that's the.Same thing that the bank would go when.When this person goes to the bank.Okay,.Show me the papers.How can I I know.That you are not going to ask for the.Money for an an madeup project, but uh.It's a real project and you're a real.Company that was not just created.Yesterday.Then uh all of this information is um.Naturally uh audited and revised um by.By automated process that are human le.Uh what does that mean?
Uh it means that.Uh we check for example okay this is a.Receipt uh but it has a digital.Signature.So it's not that uh this.Invoice for example you get from from.Another company paying for your service.Or for your infrastructure.Is uh is making this up but at least.It's on on the record it's on the ledger.Of the tax offices for example or or the.Corresponding.Regulatory.Uh office in charge of of invoice.And then uh so they they cannot uh be.Made up and the same with the with the.Revenues or how other distribution.Processes have been made.And then um so and and the and the third.Part is okay how can we then uh get this.Decentralized uh funding into the hands.Of Mariano the one that was asking for.The funding.So for this is where we.Have the smart contracts that take care.Of this um operation where the.Supporters for the project can support.Mariano's infrastructure project and.Then he can gets the fund uh to install.Or do the setup for their for their.Project.Then uh the same once uh.Mariano needs or is going to pay back uh.With the corresponding interest to their.Uh supporters.Then the smart contract also takes care.Of that with a decentralized.Distribution that's transparent and it's.Auditable for all of the stakeholders.And this is uh currently on on a suite.That we're calling DO token studio.There.Uh basically we have two two types of uh.Users.Uh now we're thinking of a third.User but the two main users of you.Probably have noticed already are the.Infrastructure operator and the uh.Investor or supporter.on one side the.Infrastructure operator as I was saying.Takes care of uploading the information.The device uh information how uh this is.Technically behaving how is the type of.Uh revenue it's going to generate is.It's going to generate distributions or.Revenue distributions.Uh every month every week or every.Quarter or annually.And those are the.Those sets uh the expected uh APR.That the uh infrastructure operator is.Offering.Uh once this is done then uh.This goes into the blockchain.So it's.It's committed that okay this is the.Information we're committed for the.Posterior auditing and then as I said.This is reviewed uh the authenticity and.The validity of the information.&gt;&gt; maybe maybe you can just have a moment.There's there's a couple of questions.&gt;&gt; uh.Yes uh so uh yes actually well going for.The first question what are latam in.Front of operator Latin operators are uh.They are the ones that that want to get.Funded.Um.RWS and infra are inherently illquid.How do you address that?
Yes.uh that's.One of the innovation that we are we are.Doing is that we are not uh tokenizing.Maybe that was one point that I was.Missing is that we are not tokenizing.The infrastructure by itself but what we.Are focusing is on the revenue this.Infrastructure is going to to generate.And that comes with a higher risk uh.Obviously but then uh it balances is the.Higher risk with the with a higher APR.Uh how do you solve regulatory.Compliance low issues?
Uh yes, this is.Uh I I I I really don't think I will be.Able to address all of those uh.Regulatory compliance issues, but I can.Say that because of the of the nature of.The project that as I was saying earlier.Um we are not tokenizing an asset and it.Itself but we are working with the.Future revenue it will produce that can.Uh solve.Uh other type of uh compliance around.Regulation issues but also it's.Important to mention that uh this is.Very uh local and depending on on on.Each country finally so uh it will it.Won't be the same for example the same.In the US and uh here in Germany or in.Chile.Um okay then wait pay is this a loan or.Is it a revenue participating in the.Uh Yes.So this can be considered um as.M multiple things.So in the end uh is.The this uh revenue for the what the.Infrastructure generates that's as I was.Saying is what's uh being kind of.Tokenized.Uh so but then if you look at from a.Different perspective then or the.Traditional perspective this could be.Taken as alone from the chat file.Uh I.I see Oscar was as.Now.Uh.Is there I don't know is who review.Central yes I think that's um those are.Most of the questions then uh yes this.Is um obviously this is um a a regulated.Um service it cannot is uh not the the.Wild west But um now I I will focus.Mostly on the technological part of how.We are addressing these issues because.For compliance I think we we can take a.Bit longer to answer all of those.Questions.Okay.So um I'll continue then.Um so.With this we are uh offering uh multiple.Features.Uh in this platform that uh this we can.Submit multiple type of evidence.Uh this is um based on on the concept of.Trusts where we are producing evidence.For all of the stages uh and all of the.Interaction the infrastructure and the.Operators are generating and producing.What does that mean?
For example,.Uh when the operator uh the first one I.I mentioned it already, the operator can.Submit, okay, these are the technical.Specifications or this is uh an invoice.Uh but then we can get more complex.Evidence when we start to aggregate uh.Different types of evidence because uh.One in invoice alone for alone for.Example uh would mean okay you you will.You will receive this payment in the.Future or you are receiving it now but.Then to do the accounting uh evidence.For example for that we need to connect.With the ERP of the of the business and.That's uh more complex than just uh.Verifying a a single invoice.Then uh.Humanoled guided integrity check.Uh means that even though this uh.Project uh or what we are doing is.Highly uh depending on automatization.Uh automat automation.Uh we still require uh people in the.Loop.personally looked at uh so.Everything goes um yes as as I was.Mentioning earlier on the the accord.Regulation then uh will rely on the.Onchain verification module so all of.The transactions especially for the the.The stakeholders that are supporting the.Project or the infrastructure operator.They can see how all of these actions.Are uh being verified and chained how.They are transparent with the respective.Proofs.And finally.Um as uh every project is different uh.All of them will have a different type.Of scorings for for and with this will.Represent basically from high risk.Project to uh and higher APR and uh.Lower risk and lower therefore APR.Uh and in practical terms how is this uh.The overview of this uh this um smart.Contracts in particular for the token.Studio is that um we as uh the the or.The infrastructure operator deploys the.The splitter contract.And there we have uh different functions.Uh to define the shareholders.Uh how are they going to be allocated,.How are they going to uh do the.Withdrawals uh every um how how often.Are going to be the distribution events.And uh to which token is this uh binded.Regularly we will be working with uh.USDC.Uh but for example this could take other.Type of tokens if uh that's how that.Project is defined but um most of most.Of the time uh we work with uh USDC.And in in simple terms uh it's um super.Uh s I think it's super easy to.Understand if there's one uh chair.Holder or token holder uh with the 10%.Then uh once the distribution take place.Uh all of the.All of the revenue that was generated.And was uh deposited in into the smart.Contract uh then it will go a 10% into.Uh the the one that has a 10% of of the.Tokens.So on how this uh distribution flow goes.Is that um first.Uh we have the admin that communicates.To the distri to the splitter contract.Uh that's going to do the distribution.Uh what's the token address then this is.Uh verified inside of the smart contract.Then it verifies.Then check the current balance for.Example are those uh Are there 100.Tokens to to distribute and then in each.Case it's uh the loop uh checking on the.Token holders.And uh the respective balance and and.There that's how it does the calculation.And this goes then into the storage um.Class where where uh finish where it's.Finished uh with the distribution.It's.Um really straightforward.Then for the withdraw then the each.Shareholder or token holder goes into.The the splitter.Uh it does the prospective verification.Check with the storage what's the.Current allocation then decrease on the.Storage part then.Uh communicates directly with the token.The token does a transfer with a good.Successful withdraw.And uh then it goes again to the to the.Throold.And uh at the storage level this is just.Just in case um I'm presenting it this.Like this because uh we are currently.Going under the respective revisions and.Auditings.Uh so it's it cannot be.Everything public.uh I mean this can.But uh not the code itself yet.And then uh we have the the cher data.Key, the config data key and the.Allocation data key which basically.Defines.Uh how is the.How is the charge for each data holder,.Who's the admin, all of the security,.What's the allocation for each uh token.Holder and and then how this can be.Allocated each time the distribution.Goes.Then here um.On the security level on how we are.Defining we are taking this very.Seriously uh defining uh the access.Control policies admin only function the.Authentication the lock on contract the.Transfer contracts.Uh also we have uh our internal scripts.For doing the a to have a deployer and.Do an anatomical.Operations.So we don't run on front run.Is front front running.Then we have allocation limits some.Validations.And and so on.Uh and this uh as a first case we've um.Presented this to investment of returns.For the for the the investors or.Supporters of of the project of.Infrastructure.But this for example.Could be used as uh token vesting models.Over team members on time for uh similar.To the revenue trading for a DAO.Treasury or for reward distribution.And then for the particular.Uh the feature that were missing for.Before are that this is a secure and.Transparent way on how this uh.Distribution.Method is uh performed because all of.The transactions are done on chain and.That these transactions are then.Proportional to each one of the.Supporters.So yes, thank you very much.Um I I hope.I didn't pass on time and.&gt;&gt; we we have we have a few questions.&gt;&gt; in in the chat I think.&gt;&gt; okay.&gt;&gt; I think the.Answer.&gt;&gt; yes.So where I was I left uh is it.Either alone with interest or is it at.Your particip Yes.As I said, it's more.Of a chair participation of the project.I was making the the loan with interest.At the beginning to make the analogy.With um traditional banking settings.Uh who will review centralized entities?
Uh who will review centralized entities?
Uh who will review centralized entities?
Uh yes.I mean this needs to go um all.Uh yes.Of all of the businesses and infrastruct.Which are the infrastructure operators.In this case goes into a know your.Business process because this has to.Also go um with antimony laundering.Policy and and all of those regulations.Uh does that mean that the entire review.Process and due diligence is no the.Proofs uh or more than the proofs the.The hash of the proofs and the evidence.Are stored unchanged because we cannot.Just publish um yeah uh accounting.States or financial states from.Companies on chain.Um is it really 100%.Of the project's revenue or is it some.Yes.Uh so when when we consider this uh.There's for the for example the the.Energy production that a solar panel is.Going to to generate.Uh it's going let's say it generates 100.Uh dollars uh per week.Then uh from.This uh there's a minimal um amount.That's defined uh during the creation of.The project that needs to go by uh to.The operation itself.Uh that could be.For example uh 30% or 20% that uh.Depends on the on the project.Uh so it's finally on the.Uh discounted from the operation then.That's what goes into the what's the.Distributed how could you manage then.State expiration if you are storing.Hashes on chain.Do you mean like uh if a proof is.Expired for example I I'm not.Uh to which state do you mean?
Uh to which state do you mean?
Uh to which state do you mean?
Uh world matias.&gt;&gt; Yes.Uh so.That is uh so when proofs are verified.It it depends on the type of pro proof.And there are multiple risk risk when.You verify proofs.Uh certainly one is.Uh for example using old proofs or.Reusing proofs.Other is uh.Just trying to use past evidence as.Newly evidence.But all of those uh.Parts uh are very part of the ver that.Of the offchain verification.And when.The onchain verification happens.Um this proof is has been already.Through this process.Um yes.So currently the the guarantees.Where.Do I pass this?
Ah uh yeah let me answer.This first.So there's currently.Um a new feature we want to to to do is.To actually put some collateral that can.Give uh stakeholders more guarantees.So ina so we would because from the.Beginning this sounds more like okay we.Will we could be giving random money to.A strangers stranger that maybe at that.Point everything was true but then still.Did a rock pole as as you mentioned and.And therefore we are uh creating this uh.Other collateralization mechanisms.But that's um not defined yet.But.That's why also on the first stage of.This we are focusing only on companies.That uh we know.Uh that can give this guarantees and are.Not a meme company for example.That's uh one one really important.Point.So stellar asset or so.So so um.The tok the the.Stellar.The artist this token actual stellar.Asset or sorban tokens.So as we as I.Was saying it's uh the token that's.Distributed is um a USDC.And how the asset uh of the token holder.Is also uh a token because uh why and.Why not a regular seller asset because.We needed to create some extra functions.That were not uh into the assets.Okay, great.I think uh I think you got.Caught up on all the questions.Great to see that there's so many.Questions, so much interest in in what.You guys are doing and how you how you.Uh how you structure it.So yeah, it was.Great.Um if there's no other questions,.Then um I guess we can we can stop here,.But thank you so much for for joining.I think it's super interesting to.See what you're doing.It's uh I I kind.Of um I kind of like these uh uh type of.Projects that are not um not the typical.Projects we see.Uh it's definitely.Using uh using tokens and using the.Platform in a different way.I think.That's that's super interesting.Yeah.&gt;&gt; Yeah.Just let me add there's a last.One.To to answer that uh last.Question.One of our also our.Current goals is uh to bring um.Liquidity from other blockchains.Um in particular from Ethereum based uh.Blockchains uh liquidity and that's uh.Because actually we're not only based on.Working on stellar but we're also.Working on base.Uh and we see this uh potential from.Bringing more liquidity to stellar.From base uh through this infrastructure.Um projects and uh yes we are taking a.Look at uh near intense.&gt;&gt; Great.Well, thank you for joining.Everyone and thank you for joining too,.Fernando.It was uh great to to catch up.With you and uh I'm sure I'll see you at.Events around the world like I have this.The past year.Thank you for the.Invitation.It was a pleasure.And and if anyone else has uh any.Questions, I'm sure you can reach out to.The team on on Discord.I think one of.The things that's very interesting about.This is that brings up some use cases.And some some things that are um that.That raises some questions because maybe.We haven't seen that before or maybe.We're not used to thinking about.Tokenization in this way or uh using the.Platform.So, a lot of great questions.That really that really um I think you.Had great answers and it's it's.Interesting to to see how you're.Building this.So, thank you everyone.And uh see you again next week.&gt;&gt; Thank you.Bye.
