Hi and welcome to this week's Stella.Developer meeting with me in the studio.Here.Today I have Fernando from dop.Protocol and I can't exactly remember.When I heard about dop protocol for the.First time but I do remember I noticed.That my feeds in all social media like.LinkedIn X anywhere this company just.Started to pop up and there was articles.And they were going to conferences and I.Just just got really curious about.What's up with these guys what are they.Doing so and and of course they were.Attacking Stellar in everything they.Were doing being awesome ambassadors.So.I started to to read a little bit up on.What they're doing and since then I've.Had the pleasure of meeting the the.Whole team several times last last.Time actually this week in Silicon.Valley where I met Oscar but met the.Team also at Meridian many other.Places.So I think it's a great.Opportunity to have them here in the.Studio and and hear what they're up to,.What they're doing and and share with.The rest of the community.So welcome.Fernando and thank you for joining.Today. Yeah, thank you for the invitation Ken.I'm pleasure to be here. so should I.Just now continue with the presentation?
Just now continue with the presentation?
Just now continue with the presentation?
 Yeah, maybe maybe just just tell a. Yeah, maybe maybe just just tell a.Little bit about who you are, how.Long how long time you've been working.On protocol. A bit of an introduction. I'm.Fernando Castillo.I'm currently the CTO.Of DOP protocol, one of the co-founders.And .Our main goal now with the protocol.Is to.Be able to all of the infrastructure.That's not being funded to get funded. by decentralized means.And now in.This presentation. hopefully I'm going to show a way on.How we can do that with doken studio.And with the other tools we've been.Developing.So first yeah what's the team a.Bit of also an introduction. car and already mentioned Oscar he's.Our CEO he's currently at Silicon.Valley doing the embark pro program.With Deron University in conjunction.With Stellar. also we have Simone Spinola who's our.Operation and business officer and.Myself as I said already and also as a.Side note I'm finishing my PhD until.Berlin now I'm in Germany currently so.It's a bit late for me now it's 10.P.m.But I'm happy to be here and .Yeah so what's the the problem that we.Are facing is that in Latin America.There are a lot of infrastructure.Operators that are lacking fund and they.Struggle to to scale because on.Traditional banking systems the they.Require to go to to ask to the bank to.Then request for a loan then go through.All the bureaucracy of the bank. but. then also time moves and they need.The the money to deploy and to create.This new infrastructure that is not.Risky by itself but maybe the banks.Consider is risky because of the type of.Size of the company maybe or the type of.Emerging market.So it's but it's not.That the business business itself of.That infrastructure is non .Investable or that it will give money .Returns.So as I was saying let's imagine that.You are Mariano you are trying to get a.Traditional credit a loan for for a.Bank. but this depending on the.Country also for example we've recently.Seen in Argentina how this country.Was facing high inflation rates or.Similar situation with Venezuela.And other countries in Latin America.With high inflation rates that then .This ties those loans to higher interest.Rates plus the the risk on the country.Itself. so there's this problem of banks. because of these situations not .Giving beneficial loans to. to these infrastructure operators and.At the same time if the.Infrastructure operator would go for.Example for a crowdfunding or a regular.Crowdfunding solution where they.Could go online and then they could say.Okay let's get all of these people.Request this this this amount of.Money.I don't know, let's ask for $100.,000.So we can build this power grid based.On on solar power.Then how then this.Operator could return or distribute.The revenue that this energy production.Is generating?
Is generating?
Is generating?
and how could they do it in a trust. and how could they do it in a trust. trustworthy fashion.So all of the .All of the people that were investing or.Supporting the project. can can give the the the money back.Or the the investment.And just as a.Parenthesis latam infra operators are.Latin American infrastructure operators.They are for example medium to small.Companies. that have this infrastructure.Projects.For example, a small or not so.Small but maybe a few kilowatts.Or 100 kilowatts of power into.Injecting into the energy grid.for.Example, a solar base or holic.Or there could be other type of.Infrastructure for example a data.Center or any type of infrastructure.That's not relying on a on a big.Company because big companies. they wouldn't have this type of.Problem to to access credits or loans.From banks. so in our or what are we proposing as.A solution we have this separated in in.Four steps.One is to provide a tool.For the operator.To hand out verifiable data from.Their existing. company or projects.So they can for.Example validate okay this solar.Solar cell is going to produce this.Amount of energy because it has this.Specifications. I can I have already bought them for.This price or I have this revenue.Evidence for similar. infrastructure. pictures or proof of location for.Example for where is it installed the.The infrastructure.And that that's the first part of okay.How can we give some some. due diligence for example that's the.Same thing that the bank would go when.When this person goes to the bank.Okay,.Show me the papers.How can I know.That you are not going to ask for the.Money for an an madeup project, but .It's a real project and you're a real.Company that was not just created.Yesterday.Then all of this information is .Naturally audited and revised by.By automated process that are human le. what does that mean?
it means that. we check for example okay this is a.Receipt but it has a digital.Signature.So it's not that this.Invoice for example you get from from.Another company paying for your service.Or for your infrastructure.Is is making this up but at least.It's on on the record it's on the ledger.Of the tax offices for example or or the.Corresponding.Regulatory. office in charge of of invoice.And then so they they cannot be.Made up and the same with the with the.Revenues or how other distribution.Processes have been made.And then so and and the and the third.Part is okay how can we then get this.Decentralized funding into the hands.Of Mariano the one that was asking for.The funding.So for this is where we.Have the smart contracts that take care.Of this operation where the.Supporters for the project can support.Mariano's infrastructure project and.Then he can gets the fund to install.Or do the setup for their for their.Project.Then the same once .Mariano needs or is going to pay back .With the corresponding interest to their. supporters.Then the smart contract also takes care.Of that with a decentralized.Distribution that's transparent and it's.Auditable for all of the stakeholders.And this is currently on on a suite.That we're calling DO token studio.There. basically we have two two types of .Users. now we're thinking of a third.User but the two main users of you.Probably have noticed already are the.Infrastructure operator and the .Investor or supporter.on one side the.Infrastructure operator as I was saying.Takes care of uploading the information.The device information how this is.Technically behaving how is the type of. revenue it's going to generate is.It's going to generate distributions or.Revenue distributions. every month every week or every.Quarter or annually.And those are the.Those sets the expected APR.That the infrastructure operator is.Offering. once this is done then .This goes into the blockchain.So it's.It's committed that okay this is the.Information we're committed for the.Posterior auditing and then as I said.This is reviewed the authenticity and.The validity of the information. maybe maybe you can just have a moment.There's there's a couple of questions. .Yes so yes actually well going for.The first question what are latam in.Front of operator Latin operators are .They are the ones that that want to get.Funded..RWS and infra are inherently illquid.How do you address that?
Yes. that's.One of the innovation that we are we are.Doing is that we are not tokenizing.Maybe that was one point that I was.Missing is that we are not tokenizing.The infrastructure by itself but what we.Are focusing is on the revenue this.Infrastructure is going to to generate.And that comes with a higher risk .Obviously but then it balances is the.Higher risk with the with a higher APR. how do you solve regulatory.Compliance low issues?
yes, this is. I really don't think I will be.Able to address all of those .Regulatory compliance issues, but I can.Say that because of the of the nature of.The project that as I was saying earlier. we are not tokenizing an asset and it.Itself but we are working with the.Future revenue it will produce that can. solve. other type of compliance around.Regulation issues but also it's.Important to mention that this is.Very local and depending on on on.Each country finally so it will it.Won't be the same for example the same.In the US and here in Germany or in.Chile. okay then wait pay is this a loan or.Is it a revenue participating in the. Yes.So this can be considered as.M multiple things.So in the end is.The this revenue for the what the.Infrastructure generates that's as I was.Saying is what's being kind of.Tokenized. so but then if you look at from a.Different perspective then or the.Traditional perspective this could be.Taken as alone from the chat file. I.I see Oscar was as.Now..Is there I don't know is who review.Central yes I think that's those are.Most of the questions then yes this.Is obviously this is a a regulated. service it cannot is not the the.Wild west But now I will focus.Mostly on the technological part of how.We are addressing these issues because.For compliance I think we we can take a.Bit longer to answer all of those.Questions.Okay.So I'll continue then. so.With this we are offering multiple.Features. in this platform that this we can.Submit multiple type of evidence. this is based on on the concept of.Trusts where we are producing evidence.For all of the stages and all of the.Interaction the infrastructure and the.Operators are generating and producing.What does that mean?
For example,. when the operator the first one I.I mentioned it already, the operator can.Submit, okay, these are the technical.Specifications or this is an invoice. but then we can get more complex.Evidence when we start to aggregate .Different types of evidence because .One in invoice alone for alone for.Example would mean okay you you will.You will receive this payment in the.Future or you are receiving it now but.Then to do the accounting evidence.For example for that we need to connect.With the ERP of the of the business and.That's more complex than just .Verifying a a single invoice.Then .Humanoled guided integrity check. means that even though this .Project or what we are doing is.Highly depending on automatization. automat automation. we still require people in the.Loop.personally looked at so.Everything goes yes as as I was.Mentioning earlier on the the accord.Regulation then will rely on the.Onchain verification module so all of.The transactions especially for the the.The stakeholders that are supporting the.Project or the infrastructure operator.They can see how all of these actions.Are being verified and chained how.They are transparent with the respective.Proofs.And finally. as every project is different .All of them will have a different type.Of scorings for for and with this will.Represent basically from high risk.Project to and higher APR and .Lower risk and lower therefore APR. and in practical terms how is this .The overview of this this smart.Contracts in particular for the token.Studio is that we as the the or.The infrastructure operator deploys the.The splitter contract.And there we have different functions. to define the shareholders. how are they going to be allocated,.How are they going to do the.Withdrawals every how how often.Are going to be the distribution events.And to which token is this binded.Regularly we will be working with .USDC. but for example this could take other.Type of tokens if that's how that.Project is defined but most of most.Of the time we work with USDC.And in in simple terms it's super. s I think it's super easy to.Understand if there's one chair.Holder or token holder with the 10%.Then once the distribution take place. all of the.All of the revenue that was generated.And was deposited in into the smart.Contract then it will go a 10% into. the the one that has a 10% of of the.Tokens.So on how this distribution flow goes.Is that first. we have the admin that communicates.To the distri to the splitter contract. that's going to do the distribution. what's the token address then this is. verified inside of the smart contract.Then it verifies.Then check the current balance for.Example are those Are there 100.Tokens to to distribute and then in each.Case it's the loop checking on the.Token holders.And the respective balance and and.There that's how it does the calculation.And this goes then into the storage .Class where where finish where it's.Finished with the distribution.It's. really straightforward.Then for the withdraw then the each.Shareholder or token holder goes into.The the splitter. it does the prospective verification.Check with the storage what's the.Current allocation then decrease on the.Storage part then. communicates directly with the token.The token does a transfer with a good.Successful withdraw.And then it goes again to the to the.Throold.And at the storage level this is just.Just in case I'm presenting it this.Like this because we are currently.Going under the respective revisions and.Auditings. so it's it cannot be.Everything public. I mean this can.But not the code itself yet.And then we have the the cher data.Key, the config data key and the.Allocation data key which basically.Defines. how is the.How is the charge for each data holder,.Who's the admin, all of the security,.What's the allocation for each token.Holder and and then how this can be.Allocated each time the distribution.Goes.Then here .On the security level on how we are.Defining we are taking this very.Seriously defining the access.Control policies admin only function the.Authentication the lock on contract the.Transfer contracts. also we have our internal scripts.For doing the a to have a deployer and.Do an anatomical.Operations.So we don't run on front run.Is front front running.Then we have allocation limits some.Validations.And and so on. and this as a first case we've .Presented this to investment of returns.For the for the the investors or.Supporters of of the project of.Infrastructure.But this for example.Could be used as token vesting models.Over team members on time for similar.To the revenue trading for a DAO.Treasury or for reward distribution.And then for the particular. the feature that were missing for.Before are that this is a secure and.Transparent way on how this .Distribution.Method is performed because all of.The transactions are done on chain and.That these transactions are then.Proportional to each one of the.Supporters.So yes, thank you very much. I hope.I didn't pass on time and. we we have we have a few questions. in in the chat I think. okay. I think the.Answer. yes.So where I was I left is it.Either alone with interest or is it at.Your particip Yes.As I said, it's more.Of a chair participation of the project.I was making the the loan with interest.At the beginning to make the analogy.With traditional banking settings. who will review centralized entities?
who will review centralized entities?
who will review centralized entities?
yes.I mean this needs to go all. yes.Of all of the businesses and infrastruct.Which are the infrastructure operators.In this case goes into a know your.Business process because this has to.Also go with antimony laundering.Policy and and all of those regulations. does that mean that the entire review.Process and due diligence is no the.Proofs or more than the proofs the.The hash of the proofs and the evidence.Are stored unchanged because we cannot.Just publish yeah accounting.States or financial states from.Companies on chain. is it really 100%.Of the project's revenue or is it some.Yes. so when when we consider this .There's for the for example the the.Energy production that a solar panel is.Going to to generate. it's going let's say it generates 100. dollars per week.Then from.This there's a minimal amount.That's defined during the creation of.The project that needs to go by to.The operation itself. that could be.For example 30% or 20% that .Depends on the on the project. so it's finally on the. discounted from the operation then.That's what goes into the what's the.Distributed how could you manage then.State expiration if you are storing.Hashes on chain.Do you mean like if a proof is.Expired for example I I'm not. to which state do you mean?
to which state do you mean?
to which state do you mean?
world matias. Yes. so.That is so when proofs are verified.It it depends on the type of pro proof.And there are multiple risk risk when.You verify proofs. certainly one is. for example using old proofs or.Reusing proofs.Other is .Just trying to use past evidence as.Newly evidence.But all of those .Parts are very part of the ver that.Of the offchain verification.And when.The onchain verification happens. this proof is has been already.Through this process. yes.So currently the the guarantees.Where.Do I pass this?
Ah yeah let me answer.This first.So there's currently. a new feature we want to to to do is.To actually put some collateral that can.Give stakeholders more guarantees.So ina so we would because from the.Beginning this sounds more like okay we.Will we could be giving random money to.A strangers stranger that maybe at that.Point everything was true but then still.Did a rock pole as as you mentioned and.And therefore we are creating this .Other collateralization mechanisms.But that's not defined yet.But.That's why also on the first stage of.This we are focusing only on companies.That we know. that can give this guarantees and are.Not a meme company for example.That's one one really important.Point.So Stellar asset or so.So so .The tok the the.Stellar.The artist this token actual Stellar.Asset or Soroban tokens.So as we as I.Was saying it's the token that's.Distributed is a USDC.And how the asset of the token holder.Is also a token because why and.Why not a regular seller asset because.We needed to create some extra functions.That were not into the assets.Okay, great.I think I think you got.Caught up on all the questions.Great to see that there's so many.Questions, so much interest in in what.You guys are doing and how you how you. how you structure it.So yeah, it was.Great. if there's no other questions,.Then I guess we can we can stop here,.But thank you so much for for joining.I think it's super interesting to.See what you're doing.It's I kind.Of I kind of like these type of.Projects that are not not the typical.Projects we see. it's definitely.Using using tokens and using the.Platform in a different way.I think.That's that's super interesting.Yeah. Yeah.Just let me add there's a last.One.To to answer that last.Question.One of our also our.Current goals is to bring .Liquidity from other blockchains. in particular from Ethereum based .Blockchains liquidity and that's .Because actually we're not only based on.Working on Stellar but we're also.Working on base. and we see this potential from.Bringing more liquidity to Stellar.From base through this infrastructure. projects and yes we are taking a.Look at near intense. Great.Well, thank you for joining.Everyone and thank you for joining too,.Fernando.It was great to to catch up.With you and I'm sure I'll see you at.Events around the world like I have this.The past year.Thank you for the.Invitation.It was a pleasure.And and if anyone else has any.Questions, I'm sure you can reach out to.The team on on Discord.I think one of.The things that's very interesting about.This is that brings up some use cases.And some some things that are that.That raises some questions because maybe.We haven't seen that before or maybe.We're not used to thinking about.Tokenization in this way or using the.Platform.So, a lot of great questions.That really that really I think you.Had great answers and it's it's.Interesting to to see how you're.Building this.So, thank you everyone.And see you again next week. Thank you.Bye.
