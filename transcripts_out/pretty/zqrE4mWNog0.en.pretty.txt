Hello everyone and welcome to this.Week's Stella developer meeting a little.Bit earlier than usual but uh the reason.Is we have some really exciting we have.A really exciting episode here uh we.Have uh some of the guys from open sein.We are doing this as a followup from the.Last session we did uh this this time.We're going to be a little bit more.Technical so uh I would like to uh.Add the open sing guys from uh to our.Studio welcome guys please uh please do.A quick introduction of who you are what.You're doing and um yeah let's get.Started yeah I can start uh yeah thanks.For uh hosting us Carston yeah really.Excited to to be here uh my name is buan.I am um open source uh developer at uh.Open.Zeppin um yeah building together with.Osun the Stellar contracts.Library um yeah my background uh yeah.It's uh uh.Mostly related uh in the past to um to.Some evm uh uh development solidity also.Um some R development so yeah trying to.To bring uh the best from uh uh from uh.All the experiences I I.Had great welcome thank.You hello everyone it's oen my name may.Be hard to pronounce for some so you can.Call me o if that's easier for you so.I'm working with OP Zeppelin for about.Uh one and a half years and my.Background is more on the the high.Performance Computing distributed.Systems and cryptography all of these.Included I started my blockchain journey.In some startups for layer zero or layer.One if you will and then transitioned.More into po do ecosystem and now I'm uh.Switched to Stell and quite happy with.It great great thank you and welcome to.You too yeah we started this journey a.While ago and the the reason is or the.Objective is to make it easier to for.For new developers to to onboard stellar.And to to build to build great Solutions.Um so where are we now how how far have.We come in implementing uh Stellar in in.Open sppin can you just give a really.Quick overview of where we are and.What's being worked.On if you want to go you can go yeah.Sure yeah so yeah it's been couple.Couple months that uh we we kicked it.Off um we are already on our like.Approaching our second audit meaning.That we are we accomplished our second.Milestone and the idea is that we uh we.Uh got our work audited on a regular.Basis so the the the products the the.Tools uh we are delivering to.Stellar ecosystem are safe and secure.And um uh yeah um so so at the moment.Like we um uh last month for E Denver we.Uh we shipped our first uh uh first.First.Release uh that was um about fible.Tokens and um uh the PO.Utility now we are heading to uh.Delivering um the non.Funable um Implement non fible token.Tokens.Implementation.Uh packed with couple of extensions so.That that suits different uh use cases.So and yeah next week we are uh kicking.Off the the second audit that will um.That will last for another week and and.Uh then we are shipping uh the we are.Releasing the next uh uh yeah the next.Release okay great this is where we are.Great so for for those who may not have.Uh followed the the openin initiative or.Have just curious what what's what what.We we're doing here um can you maybe.Share maybe share the screen just show.An example of what what.The what it looks like like the maybe.The wizard uh just really quick give an.Introduction to like what is it the.Developers are experiencing and what is.It the developers can do right.Now um yeah sure I can I can uh.Showcase um the wizard The Open.Zepp Wizard and how it makes super easy.For developers to.To have like a base basic smart contract.Uh at some uh.Custom functionalities uh if they're.Needed and uh deployed to to testet um.Yeah I I would love to uh to do that.Yeah I think that would be a great.Introduction to to open sa for for new.For new develop yeah sure uh so let me.Share my screen.Screen I think it's loading yeah okay so.Here it is the the the Wizard so it's uh.Wizard.Open.com um I believe it may be helpful.To zoom in just one or two more bits to.Make it more.Readable okay this is this time I think.Good what what do you.Think yeah it's it's uh I I think I.Think we can we can read it now yeah it.Looks.Good okay so yeah this is um our wizard.Uh which the idea of it is like to to.Make uh life easier if you need to uh.Like to to build up something uh quickly.Uh so uh some with some base uh some.Basic features you can uh use it uh yeah.You can see we have for different.Languages and U.Chains.Uh uh so here at that's Stellar for the.Moment we have only fungible but as we.Fin once we finish the non fungible um.Um module and get get it uh audited it.Will be added here similar to so you can.See at for solidity uh there are.Different um modules for the moment here.We have only F and uh thanks to this UI.You can configure uh the Bas the basic.Properties of your Tok for example let's.Call call it.Awesome awesome.Token uh it's uh yeah really basic uh so.And here we can Define for example if we.Want to do some Prem Min uh let's say we.Want to to Mint um 1,000 of bit of this.Token and here there are different um Fe.Fe that we can add on top of this basic.Implementation for example say we want.It to be minable and you see how uh the.UI gets updated if you want to to add a.Burnable functionality meaning to allow.Users to burn their tokens they wish so.We can click on that and yeah this is.How our contract looks.Like then uh let's uh deploy it to to.Test.Net uh so we are going to uh set up uh a.Project uh with the with the Stell.CLI uh so uh yeah for those who yeah.Uh yeah we can check basically we can.Check at Stellar documentation how to to.Install the CLI and uh uh and use it but.Yeah here we're initializing the uh the.Project uh so here we have we have our.Awesome token um.Contract uh yeah um we we need to.Add we need to add the uh the.Dependency uh here the recommendation is.To use to pin it to a specific version.Or.Tag um so as the this version 0.one uh.Is the the most recently audited it's uh.This version that we are going to use.Then uh we are ready.To like to delete this boiler plate that.Was provided by the C and go back to uh.The wizard UI here.We are copying our uh.Contract going back to the file we are.Pasting pasting.It and yeah so we have it we have.Everything set up if we like if uh uh we.Need to do some.Modifications uh we we can uh we and we.Know of course what what we are doing we.Can go and straight to the.To the codent modified then.Um we are going to uh to build.This to build this uh contract so it is.Done then uh the recommendations are to.Also um not only build but also.To uh optimize it.Uh so.There is a special yeah there is a CLI.Command for it uh so well it's not.So here it is we we gained like.Something like 1,000 and something bytes.Of our optimized version so it is ready.To be deployed.Now uh just for the record I have like I.Set it up um wallet um from the Stellar.Lab and funded it with some uh with some.Um.Lumens test net lumens and now uh we are.Going to deploy to deploy.It uh so it was called my.Awesome my awesome token.Right we are deploying it uh with the.Alice um with the Alice uh.Key uh yeah here is U an address that.Will be the owner and uh.The the recipient.Let's let's say it will be Alice again.So Alice will re receive the the the.Tokens so if everything's.[Music].Fine we should have our contract.So yeah this is fine it gets uh it got.Deployed this at this.Address and Alice uh received the 1,000.Uh 1,000 tokens that we uh we.Uh yeah we we preed basically and now.Yeah you can uh interact with this uh.Contract uh either with the CLI or build.A uh UI uh build a UI for it maybe just.Let you uh let demonstrate how uh we can.Invoke.It.Um so just to so this is the.Contract so yeah it actually it is.Stored under token the token Alas and we.Going to check um we going to check the.Balance of.Alice yeah okay so it's working we.Checked so the balance uh is uh correct.Because it's.Uh uh yeah how.The yeah basically we preed 1,000 with.18 decimals so that's why we see so big.Zero so so many zeros and yeah um I.Guess uh this is.Enough this is great yeah this is great.Really it really I convince you it's.Really easy I mean uh of course you have.To uh uh.Be familiar a bit with the Stellar CI.But I think it's a great very intuitive.And user friendly so yeah it's really.Easy to to get up to speed with uh with.That so yeah yeah yeah I I think this.This uh demo showed really how how.Simple it is to to to work with and one.Thing that I that I appreciate a lot too.Is the testing that this goes through on.Your end so if if you are implementing.This yourself and maybe you you are.Still pretty new to uh development on on.On Stellar um I think just knowing that.This has been tested thoroughly this is.Secure this is safe I think that that.Gives me a lot more confidence as a.Developer that the products I'm building.Uh that they are also safe for for the.Users so I think that's that's something.That you know the convenience of of.Using open sein is is is obvious here.It's super easy and simple but I think I.I think for me the knowing that that.This has actually gone through very.Serious testing that that that's.Something that I would like to at least.Put a little bit of Spotlight on um I.Think uh maybe we can see if there's.Anyone that has any questions uh let me.See I see Elliot actually one of my team.Members he has a question here uh he.Says in the nft contracts are you.Implementing the same extensions as the.F tokens or is a different set of.Extensions I believe I can take this one.Um so they are not completely the same.Since the standards We are following.Are getting differentiated as well so.For nfts it would be enumerable.Consecutive minable.Burnable and also.Claimable but some of these are not.Exactly.Extensions uh but we want to give the.Name of them so that if a person from.Other ecosystems comes here and wants to.Search for these they will know how they.Are implemented or adopted into Stellar.So these five things that I mentioned.Will be.Covered okay great we have another.Question from uh JS maxi uh it says said.We.Are sentential developing an R ERC.4626 standard Vault Solution on Stell.San and if that could be integrated into.Open sain standard library for soran in.The future I I I don't actually don't.Know if that's something we can we can.Answer here uh I think that's uh.Probably is about 46.36 yeah.46 26 yeah yeah yeah yeah it is it is um.It is included in the road map down the.Yeah uh for the next Milestones I'm not.Sure if in the in the Milestone 2 or.Milestone three but it is for sure.Included in in the road map okay but the.Question is they are asking for.Collaboration so they are already trying.To build it so yes by the way yes we are.Uh the title of our jobs is open source.So of course any collaboration is more.Than welcome please be sure to check out.Our contributor guidelines which is the.Usual stuff uh we have like mainstream.Things there and anybody who wants to.Contribute can contribute in fact we do.Have three external contributors right.Now so the more the merrier great and.This is this is why it's great to have.You guys on here because I was not able.To answer that question you you guys are.The experts on that okay let's see uh we.Have one question more from Matias uh.What design considerations were made for.The library considering classic sorban.And How Stella classic assets.Work yeah I can I can maybe maybe.Partially give an answer and O you're.Going to to uh to add if I miss anything.Um yeah so we are trying to.Uh navigate between uh like different uh.Let's say uh uh requirements concerns uh.And yeah of course.Um uh one of the requirements is to to.Make things uh compatible with Stellar.Classic uh for the moment uh we have.Finished with um with the fungible uh.Fungible token implementation that is.Like in the uh that was audited I.Demonstrated and uh actually it overlaps.By uh with many of the features that are.Available already um from the sorbon uh.Sbone SDK itself so uh on that on that.Front we haven't done much because yeah.Most of the work was already done by the.The uh Stellar development foundation.Team uh so.Um yeah for the nft that we are for the.Nft part modu that we are working at.Right now um yeah there there are some.There are some discussions about.How uh how this compatibility can be uh.Brought uh on the.Table uh there are some ideas that are.Circulating but uh yeah trying to to.Accommodate also for existing Stellar um.Developers that are like try to leverage.Uh Stellar classic assets but also for.Some other use cases where people need.Uh need some uh customizations uh that.Can be brought only by uh smart.Contracts okay.Great let's see yeah and I was actually.Thinking about this mat was uh he was.Asking on what's on.Um what's on the the road map what what.Is coming next uh can you maybe talk a.Little bit about the road.Map there will be smart wallets many.Other token.Standards um some utilities like fix.Point arithmetic and Merle proofs stuff.Like that but uh they are.All discussed and we may change the.Order Etc depending on the community.Feedback and our.Priorities okay great yeah actually yeah.Actually yeah we are really looking for.Like feedback what is what are the.Utilities the The Primitives that are.Most the mostly like Builders from.Stellar are like uh eager to see so yeah.We are definitely looking for uh for.Feedback uh so that we can Shape Up.Together uh the our road.Map okay great uh so we have a question.Also from L again uh any highlights or.Low lights you can share about the.Stella sorond architecture compared to.Other blockchains since you have work.With other.Chains you want me to start buan and.Then you can continue okay so.Authorization is done in a great way I.Will let poan speak more on that but but.I also uh admire the way authorization.And authentication Works in.San my.Biggest uh admiration comes from the.Developer experience it's great right.Now it's super simple yet super safe and.We also want to and try to do our best.To keep this safety and simplicity in.Our uh.Yeah I'm.Also uh joining uh Al on on this on this.Um uh front and yeah just to add that uh.Like yeah authorizations uh.How uh how they're handled uh like uh on.A protocol level actually uh relieves uh.A lot of uh lot of remove a lot of pain.Points that for example developers from.Coming from evm chains are having like.For dealing with.Authorizations um actually many of the.Things that are natively supported uh.And Builders shouldn't care like at all.In other ecosystems like it's additional.Overhead of like how to construct your.Uh contract so uh they're not too big.They're too complex and here like.Builders can focus on what's the most.Important the business logic that is uh.That is uh regarding their their.Specific application so this is a huge a.Huge benefit um other thing that comes.To my mind is for example how uh how uh.The uh how we deal with.Upgradability uh in uh in soron.It's just a seamless like.A a wine liner compared to uh compared.To uh for example ethereum where are.Like uh dozens of different OB.Gradability patterns uh with different.Tradeoffs uh security concerns Etc and.Here is just a no-brainer so it's bit a.Big thumbs up uh about the work that.That's done uh.In the background so yeah okay great.Well that was all very positive so happy.To hear that um I think Matias was.Asking about the soulbound tokens if if.That's possible uh is that something.That's been cons being considered or.Thought about or is that not something.That's been been considered.Yet sorry it cut and I couldn't hear.Oh uh so Matas was asking about Soul.Bound tokens if that's soul to.Yeah uh actually it is not something.That is uh planned straight straight.Away uh but.Um but yeah I mean with the nfts we are.Building the the the the ground for for.For that and uh yeah maybe yeah we have.To to see how yeah how this is uh uh how.This can fit in the future Milestone.Okay great by the way it is worth to.Note that uh we are building this for.Community so if Community wants that we.Will for sure do.Great uh have you.Identified uh the biggest pain points.From a developer experience for building.Cross Chain.Solutions uh this also a question from.Yes right now we haven't explored how we.Would do cross chain stuff for Stellar.So I for myself am not able to answer.That as of yet maybe in the upcoming.Months I will be but maybe buan will.Have something to say I don't know yeah.Just to add that there there is the AEL.Team that are doing some yeah great um.Great job on that front so if you are.Interested in Cross chain uh cross chain.Standards uh don't remember the exact.Number of it uh but U yeah you can check.Their their work uh yeah they have.Really good good stuff there yeah okay.Great any any other questions let's see.I think we got H there's only one I.Skipped was what is the expected Cadence.Of releases for for the library.Yeah I answered that right now in chat.But let me say it from here as well we.Are uh we are we will try to have a.Monthly release.Schedule the keyword here is trying but.We will do our.Best okay.Great let's.See any any other.Questions I think we we got uh I think.We got quite a quite a few questions.That were outstanding from from from our.Last session where we we were not really.Provide able to provide good answers I.Think we got got all of that covered so.It it was really great to to have you.Have you both on on on this call and um.And I think I I'm super excited about.What what this means for the developer.Experience on on on stellar and uh I.Can't wait to see what people are.Building using uh using the open sein.Library uh any any final words from your.Guys yeah just uh yeah thanks thanks a.Lot for for having us uh it was uh it.Was a pleasure for us uh also to thanks.For all the questions and yeah don't uh.Yeah don't hesitate to to Ping us on.Discord.Um uh and yeah chat there about uh about.Uh whatever you you think uh uh yeah.Yeah it's it's important so that we we.Build a a great tools for the whole web.System so yeah thank you and in addition.To that uh please feel free to open up.Any issues for the features you want to.Say or bugs you want to report or just.Questions you want to ask we are also.Pretty active on GitHub and it's a uh.Public repository so feel free to.Interact with us from GitHub as.Well great thank you so much for joining.And uh maybe we will do a follow-up.Session uh at a later time uh this was.Great love the demo love to pick your.Brains on on these topics so thank you.Again for joining and thank you for.Everyone who uh who listened in here.Thank you and see you next week bye by.Right thank you.
