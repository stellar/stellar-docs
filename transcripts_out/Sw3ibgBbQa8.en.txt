last week's meeting we were discussing

last week's meeting we were discussing
about what happens when entries are

delayed with outstanding run balance
delayed with outstanding run balance
delayed with outstanding run balance
um and we decided that it was probably
um and we decided that it was probably
um and we decided that it was probably
not a good idea to refund
not a good idea to refund
not a good idea to refund
um the outstanding balance and instead
um the outstanding balance and instead
um the outstanding balance and instead
just have the balance be burned uh the
just have the balance be burned uh the
just have the balance be burned uh the
reason for this is that if you allow
reason for this is that if you allow
reason for this is that if you allow
rent balance refund then you open up a

also refunding my balance doesn't really
also refunding my balance doesn't really

make sense because many different users

May pay for the rent balance only a

single user benefits from the refund and

so for these reasons it seems that the
so for these reasons it seems that the

best policy for whenever an entry is

delayed without standing rent balance is

they still have to be stored perpetually

it's significantly more advantageous for

bounce uh refund we're thinking instead

of adding a base fee called the archival
of adding a base fee called the archival
of adding a base fee called the archival
fee and essentially what this would be

is just some flat fee probably tied to

the size of Ledger entry that you have
the size of Ledger entry that you have

to pay in order to create the entry

initially and then if you delete the

entry before it gets archived you
entry before it gets archived you
entry before it gets archived you
receive this as a refund and so this
receive this as a refund and so this
receive this as a refund and so this
allows you to have someone set up for
allows you to have someone set up for
allows you to have someone set up for
deletion and then if you don't delete an

this uh archival fee is uh burned and so

the thinking being that this gives users

incessive to delete entries before it
incessive to delete entries before it
incessive to delete entries before it
gets into the archive but because it is

balance it can't be gained nearly as

this does make you know the answers more
this does make you know the answers more
this does make you know the answers more
expensive and this also increases the
expensive and this also increases the
expensive and this also increases the
size of the entry because we'll have to
size of the entry because we'll have to
size of the entry because we'll have to
store the archival feed as a parameter
store the archival feed as a parameter
store the archival feed as a parameter
so it increases the size of all entries
so it increases the size of all entries
so it increases the size of all entries
by about four bytes

um but I think this provides a good

General thoughts on both the issue about

are relatively minimal because there's

still essentially how we calculate the
still essentially how we calculate the
still essentially how we calculate the
temporary entry fee is that say if your
temporary entry fee is that say if your
temporary entry fee is that say if your
temporary entry lasts 128 ledgers what
temporary entry lasts 128 ledgers what
temporary entry lasts 128 ledgers what
you do is that we take a snapshot of the
you do is that we take a snapshot of the
you do is that we take a snapshot of the
current rent fee multiply that by 128
current rent fee multiply that by 128
current rent fee multiply that by 128
and that's how much temporary entry
and that's how much temporary entry
and that's how much temporary entry
costs and so today a temporary entry and
costs and so today a temporary entry and
costs and so today a temporary entry and
a restorable entry are very similar in
a restorable entry are very similar in
a restorable entry are very similar in
price and so I could see uh Network

when a temporary entry really could do
