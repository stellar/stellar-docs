restore an entry from the archive and
then put it back on the ledger so it can

proof of inclusion that this entry that
proof of inclusion that this entry that
you say was archived actually does exist
you say was archived actually does exist
you say was archived actually does exist
in the archive and so this Merkle

in the archive and so this Merkle
structure is very powerful because it

structure is very powerful because it
means that validators are able to check

and make sure that the entry you say is

in the archive is actually legitimate

but the validators don't need to store
but the validators don't need to store
but the validators don't need to store
the archive all they need to do is store
the archive all they need to do is store
the archive all they need to do is store
this root Merkel hash and then they are

able to validate proofs that are
able to validate proofs that are
able to validate proofs that are
generated from the archive so kind of
generated from the archive so kind of

high level how this works is the
high level how this works is the
high level how this works is the
validators themselves don't store any of

validators themselves don't store any of
the archive State and cannot produce

archive nodes do store the entire
archive nodes do store the entire
archive nodes do store the entire
archive State and have enough

that entry will go to zero and that

you default on rent from the perspective

of the validator it's as if this entry

this would be allowed right because the

in the archive it will create and

generate new keys which means that we

you can imagine if this process was

repeated several times it's possible to

collisions aren't that big of a deal
collisions aren't that big of a deal

right so if you can imagine if you have

say a balance of some amount of token
say a balance of some amount of token
say a balance of some amount of token
with your given key and there are
with your given key and there are

multiple different balances you have so
multiple different balances you have so
multiple different balances you have so
say you have 10 xlm in an account and
say you have 10 xlm in an account and
say you have 10 xlm in an account and
then that 10xl imbalance gets archived
then that 10xl imbalance gets archived
then that 10xl imbalance gets archived
and then someone sends you another 5xlm
and then someone sends you another 5xlm
and then someone sends you another 5xlm
and eventually that entry gets archived

with your key there are two entries in

balance one with 10 xlm one with 5xlm

because both of them are valid right you

spend that 5x Alum and then restore the

contract implementation that uses a

say that this nonce value is something

say that this nonce value is something
like 10 a non-zero value and then gets

when it needs to do something the token

what's in the archive because the

whenever the contract sees that there

instead of going to the archive and

restoring the nonce with a correct value
of 10 what the contract will do is just

create a new nonce with a value of zero
create a new nonce with a value of zero
create a new nonce with a value of zero
and so what you can imagine is say that

this is a problem because the validators

where you have some sort of kyc Entry
where you have some sort of kyc Entry
where you have some sort of kyc Entry

what's what's gonna happen yeah so when

you restore unique data it's

add to the bucket list immediately

add to the bucket list immediately
because unique or for Unique data
because unique or for Unique data
because unique or for Unique data
because unique data is known to be

because unique data is known to be

key collision between the archive and
key collision between the archive and
key collision between the archive and
the bucket list so you can just

automatically add to the bucket list for

recreatable storage this isn't true
recreatable storage this isn't true

there could be a key collision and so

whenever you restore a recreatable

it's not immediately add to the bucket

responsibility of the smart contract
responsibility of the smart contract
implementation to resolve these

from this function you can check the

if there is a collision then what the
if there is a collision then what the

that's live on the bucket list and the

just write the result which is the sum
just write the result which is the sum
