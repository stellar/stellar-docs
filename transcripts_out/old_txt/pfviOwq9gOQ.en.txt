So, we're going to say we're going to
So, we're going to say we're going to
So, we're going to say we're going to
generate a new account, which we defined
generate a new account, which we defined
generate a new account, which we defined
here, right? Sorbon account equals

already generated that. All right. And
already generated that. All right. And
already generated that. All right. And
then we're going to build the files.
then we're going to build the files.
then we're going to build the files.
Right. So what does that mean? We're
Right. So what does that mean? We're

then it's going to deploy that right
then it's going to deploy that right
then it's going to deploy that right
to test net. once it takes once it

going to record the contract ID and then
going to record the contract ID and then
going to record the contract ID and then
it's going to build the TypeScript

this as creating like a smart contract
this as creating like a smart contract
this as creating like a smart contract

coming from the Stellar SDK. Well,
that's because you actually
that's because you actually
that's because you actually
you create your own node module sets
you create your own node module sets
you create your own node module sets
for the Stellar SD or for the smart

we're defining all the functions here
we're defining all the functions here
we're defining all the functions here
along with the with the arguments. So
along with the with the arguments. So

you see hello only contains one argument
you see hello only contains one argument
you see hello only contains one argument
which is two and it's defined as a

All right, so simple enough. We're
All right, so simple enough. We're
All right, so simple enough. We're
awaiting a a function here and the

Let me go ahead and drag this on over

Make sure. Okay. Cool. Cool. So you guys
Make sure. Okay. Cool. Cool. So you guys
can see

So
So
So
believe it was the exclamation mark. All
believe it was the exclamation mark. All
believe it was the exclamation mark. All
right, cool. So we have hello world. So
right, cool. So we have hello world. So
right, cool. So we have hello world. So
we're actually able to change that.
we're actually able to change that.
we're actually able to change that.
this is we're able to do this because
this is we're able to do this because
this is we're able to do this because
we're we're not actually making a call
we're we're not actually making a call
we're we're not actually making a call
