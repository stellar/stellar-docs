called math basically and all it does is

it adds two integers right so there's
it adds two integers right so there's
it adds two integers right so there's
a do math function on the spark contract
a do math function on the spark contract
a do math function on the spark contract
that we're actually invoking using our

that's called there so this do math
that's called there so this do math

then after it's signed we're going to
then after it's signed we're going to
then after it's signed we're going to
use a pass key server and launch tube to
use a pass key server and launch tube to
use a pass key server and launch tube to
actually shoot off that transaction to
actually shoot off that transaction to
actually shoot off that transaction to

dig into the xdr of the response
dig into the xdr of the response
