to confirm in a particular block and we
to confirm in a particular block and we
to confirm in a particular block and we
call these sets of trusted nodes quorum
call these sets of trusted nodes quorum
call these sets of trusted nodes quorum
slices so
slices so
slices so
let's unpack what quorum slices actually
let's unpack what quorum slices actually
let's unpack what quorum slices actually
mean
so to understand how consensus is
so to understand how consensus is
reached on Stellar let's first look at
reached on Stellar let's first look at
reached on Stellar let's first look at
the examples of these quantum slices
the examples of these quantum slices
the examples of these quantum slices
that we just discussed so recall that a
that we just discussed so recall that a
that we just discussed so recall that a
quorum slice is a set of nodes that a
quorum slice is a set of nodes that a
quorum slice is a set of nodes that a
validator chooses to trust
validator chooses to trust
validator chooses to trust
on the right we have a network of four
on the right we have a network of four
on the right we have a network of four
nodes a b c and d and we express trust
nodes a b c and d and we express trust
nodes a b c and d and we express trust
relationship between these nodes
relationship between these nodes
relationship between these nodes
with arrows so for example a has b and c
with arrows so for example a has b and c
with arrows so for example a has b and c
in its quorum slice
in its quorum slice
in its quorum slice
and another example is node b it has a c
and another example is node b it has a c
and another example is node b it has a c
and d in its quorum slice
and d in its quorum slice
and d in its quorum slice
so now that we know what quorum slices
so now that we know what quorum slices
so now that we know what quorum slices
are let's define quorum
are let's define quorum
are let's define quorum
so
so
so
quorum is a non-empty set of nodes that
quorum is a non-empty set of nodes that
quorum is a non-empty set of nodes that
contains a slice for each member so for
contains a slice for each member so for
contains a slice for each member so for
example a b and c is not a quorum why
example a b and c is not a quorum why
example a b and c is not a quorum why
well because it actually does not
well because it actually does not
well because it actually does not
contain a slice full slice for b and c
contain a slice full slice for b and c
contain a slice full slice for b and c
if you look at the diagram
if you look at the diagram
if you look at the diagram
so you see that d is in the quorum slice
so you see that d is in the quorum slice
so you see that d is in the quorum slice
for both b and c
for both b and c
for both b and c
so it must be in the form on the other
so it must be in the form on the other
so it must be in the form on the other
hand a b c and d is a quorum because it
hand a b c and d is a quorum because it
hand a b c and d is a quorum because it
includes a slice for each member
includes a slice for each member
includes a slice for each member
so now that we know what quorum slices
so now that we know what quorum slices
so now that we know what quorum slices
and forms are the key detail of
and forms are the key detail of
and forms are the key detail of
consensus on Stellar is that network the
consensus on Stellar is that network the
consensus on Stellar is that network the
network only confirms a block if a
network only confirms a block if a
network only confirms a block if a
quorum agrees on that block so it needs
quorum agrees on that block so it needs
quorum agrees on that block so it needs
the agreement of a whole quorum to
the agreement of a whole quorum to
the agreement of a whole quorum to
confirm the transactions
great so now that we've talked a little

you're probably very confused because i
you're probably very confused because i
you're probably very confused because i
haven't defined either liveness or

important point that I want to convey is
that there are three desired properties
that there are three desired properties

those are safety liveness and full
those are safety liveness and full

so safety is a guarantee that all nodes
so safety is a guarantee that all nodes
so safety is a guarantee that all nodes
produce the same block the same valid

and then finally fault tolerance ensures
and then finally fault tolerance ensures
and then finally fault tolerance ensures
that the network can tolerate node
that the network can tolerate node
that the network can tolerate node
failure so either nodes going down or
failure so either nodes going down or

actually becoming malicious and sending
actually becoming malicious and sending
actually becoming malicious and sending
like conflicting messages to other nodes
like conflicting messages to other nodes
like conflicting messages to other nodes
so in distributed systems it is proven
so in distributed systems it is proven
so in distributed systems it is proven
that you can only have two out of three
that you can only have two out of three

of these properties and typically

consensus protocols always want to
consensus protocols always want to
consensus protocols always want to
guarantee fault tolerance

fault tolerance they're left with
fault tolerance they're left with

deciding between safety and lightness so
deciding between safety and lightness so
deciding between safety and lightness so
what exactly happens when either safety
what exactly happens when either safety
what exactly happens when either safety
or liveness are selected
or liveness are selected

and we'll look into example of this
and we'll look into example of this
and we'll look into example of this
a little bit closer in the next slide as
a little bit closer in the next slide as
a little bit closer in the next slide as
well
yeah so let's see a visual example of
yeah so let's see a visual example of
how liveness is picked over safety so
how liveness is picked over safety so
how liveness is picked over safety so
here yeah each clipboard icon basically

nodes can learn about it at different
nodes can learn about it at different
nodes can learn about it at different
speeds so it's actually possible for two

blocks on the network to have a
blocks on the network to have a
blocks on the network to have a
different view of the blockchain

but what if some nodes haven't learned
but what if some nodes haven't learned
but what if some nodes haven't learned
about the longer chain yet so they
about the longer chain yet so they
about the longer chain yet so they
continue to follow the chain that
continue to follow the chain that

they currently consider the longest and
they currently consider the longest and

this is how you can end up with a
this is how you can end up with a
this is how you can end up with a
different view of the blockchain as we
different view of the blockchain as we
different view of the blockchain as we
try to show in in this example
so on the other hand let's look at the
so on the other hand let's look at the
network that prefers safety over

issuing account so again what I'm doing

here is with the distribution account

I'm trusting the issuer account for an

going to see that I have generated the

and I'm going to sign this in the

let's hope this works
so I need for that I need the secret key
so I need for that I need the secret key
if you recall I need the secret key of
if you recall I need the secret key of
if you recall I need the secret key of
the
the
the

and then I can submit the transaction in
and then I can submit the transaction in
the transactions
this is a three to five seconds as you
this is a three to five seconds as you
can see I submitted the transaction and
can see I submitted the transaction and
can see I submitted the transaction and
the transaction is complete again this
the transaction is complete again this
the transaction is complete again this
interface you can use to sort of create
interface you can use to sort of create

any kind of transaction I'm going to do
any kind of transaction I'm going to do
any kind of transaction I'm going to do
one more transaction really quickly
one more transaction really quickly

which is basically with the issuing

I'm going to make a payment
I'm going to make a payment

so I'm putting in the issuing account
so I'm putting in the issuing account
so I'm putting in the issuing account
now I'm fetching the next sequence
now I'm fetching the next sequence

I'm going to create a payment operation

this always makes me nervous

here is a distribution account
I'm going to send I don't know 13 13 13.
I'm going to send I don't know 13 13 13.

but I'm going to wrap it all together so
but I'm going to wrap it all together so
but I'm going to wrap it all together so
nicely in the end
nicely in the end

and once I sign it
I can submit the transaction let's hope
I can submit the transaction let's hope
it works
it works
it works
transaction submitted okay

so what I just did was that I basically
so what I just did was that I basically
so what I just did was that I basically
created two accounts one is a issuing
created two accounts one is a issuing
created two accounts one is a issuing
account that actually creates and sends

the asset in a distribution account the
the asset in a distribution account the
the asset in a distribution account the
distribution account essentially linked
distribution account essentially linked
distribution account essentially linked
to the issuing account and said I trust
to the issuing account and said I trust
to the issuing account and said I trust
you to send me an asset and the issuing
you to send me an asset and the issuing
you to send me an asset and the issuing
account made a payment to the
account made a payment to the
account made a payment to the
distribution account and now that
distribution account and now that
distribution account and now that
account will hold a balance of the asset
account will hold a balance of the asset
account will hold a balance of the asset
and that was basically we just issued an
