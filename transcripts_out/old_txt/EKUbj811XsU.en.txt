both of which have the same goal which

without further ado let us start to talk

and the first sort of topic that we
and the first sort of topic that we
and the first sort of topic that we
wanted to talk about was
wanted to talk about was
wanted to talk about was
a question about reserve requirement and
a question about reserve requirement and
a question about reserve requirement and
how it works in each of these caps so

cap 38 does not increase

the reserve requirement so I guess the
the reserve requirement so I guess the
the reserve requirement so I guess the
first question is
first question is
first question is
which model is better is there any
which model is better is there any
which model is better is there any
concern about
concern about
concern about
either model so reserve requirements
well this isn't very deep but it's
well this isn't very deep but it's
easier to reduce reserve requirements
easier to reduce reserve requirements
easier to reduce reserve requirements
than
than
than
increase them so you know if
increase them so you know if
increase them so you know if
if there's doubt I guess it'd be more
if there's doubt I guess it'd be more
if there's doubt I guess it'd be more
conservative to

to have the reserve requirement
to have the reserve requirement
to have the reserve requirement
initially
maybe we can go over the motivation for
maybe we can go over the motivation for
not having reserve requirements because
not having reserve requirements because
not having reserve requirements because
most ledger entries do
most ledger entries do

yeah I can sound just kind of weird

so in cat 38 that that version of the
so in cat 38 that that version of the
so in cat 38 that that version of the
proposal does not

have the reserve requirement and the the
have the reserve requirement and the the

main motivation is basically
main motivation is basically
main motivation is basically
it's it's not remotely obvious who
it's it's not remotely obvious who
it's it's not remotely obvious who
should own this thing in the first place
should own this thing in the first place
should own this thing in the first place
like why should
like why should
like why should
any given account be responsible for
any given account be responsible for
any given account be responsible for
paying this which is you know it can't
paying this which is you know it can't

intrinsically a multi-party thing

and being the person who created it
and being the person who created it
and being the person who created it
isn't necessarily a meaningful concept
isn't necessarily a meaningful concept
isn't necessarily a meaningful concept
but more importantly it's not that
but more importantly it's not that
but more importantly it's not that
there's no reserve requirement at all
there's no reserve requirement at all
there's no reserve requirement at all
because the pool can't exist if there
because the pool can't exist if there
because the pool can't exist if there
isn't at least one
isn't at least one
isn't at least one
trust line for the pool
trust line for the pool
trust line for the pool
for the pool share I should say so
for the pool share I should say so
for the pool share I should say so
basically
basically
basically
it's kind of like you get it like you
it's kind of like you get it like you
it's kind of like you get it like you
know when you're the first person to
know when you're the first person to
know when you're the first person to
create the pool
create the pool
create the pool
you get it like half off you basically
you get it like half off you basically
you get it like half off you basically
get two entries for the price of one
get two entries for the price of one
get two entries for the price of one
but then you know if there were a
but then you know if there were a
but then you know if there were a
thousand people using the pool it would
thousand people using the pool it would
thousand people using the pool it would
actually be like a thousand people
actually be like a thousand people
actually be like a thousand people
paying a reserve for one single entry
paying a reserve for one single entry
paying a reserve for one single entry
or if there were you know ten
or if there were you know ten
or if there were you know ten
thousand people would be even more more
thousand people would be even more more
thousand people would be even more more
like that
like that
like that
so that's kind of the way that I see
so that's kind of the way that I see
so that's kind of the way that I see
this motivation
this motivation
this motivation
all right so there's no way to abuse
all right so there's no way to abuse
all right so there's no way to abuse
this because you can't just create an
this because you can't just create an
this because you can't just create an
infinite number of these you'll need
infinite number of these you'll need
infinite number of these you'll need
infinite number of trust lines as well
so so in other words basically the trust
so so in other words basically the trust
line it sort of serves as the reserve
line it sort of serves as the reserve
line it sort of serves as the reserve
requirement rather than creating a new
requirement rather than creating a new

liquidity pool

right that's a pretty good explanation
right that's a pretty good explanation
right that's a pretty good explanation
of it yeah
I mean I think like I mean that's a
I mean I think like I mean that's a
reasonable explanation
reasonable explanation
reasonable explanation
yeah so
it'd be a bummer if we changed our minds
it'd be a bummer if we changed our minds
but yeah and later
but yeah and later
but yeah and later
wanted to like increase it but that does
wanted to like increase it but that does
wanted to like increase it but that does
seem reasonable
I mean if that's the case maybe we're
I mean if that's the case maybe we're
done talking about reserve requirements
done talking about reserve requirements
done talking about reserve requirements
like does anyone have anything else
like does anyone have anything else
like does anyone have anything else
to to to say about them yeah we sort of

so what happens what happens to the pool

I'm just wondering if there's some kind

I'm just wondering if there's some kind
of spammy edge case where

people create and destroy trust lines

quickly to get some kind of
quickly to get some kind of

ephemeral pull advantage
I mean I guess it could but like the
I mean I guess it could but like the

it's hard to see how you could get value

I do think that like nikola has a good
I do think that like nikola has a good
I do think that like nikola has a good
point about the
point about the
point about the
the multi-asset pools you know like
the multi-asset pools you know like
the multi-asset pools you know like
balancer type pools
and I think in in that kind of a setting
and I think in in that kind of a setting
we could always say you know like
we could always say you know like
we could always say you know like
okay well we're gonna charge fees for
okay well we're gonna charge fees for

but not for these types you know

it's just a matter of like do we think
that that's even necessary at this point
that that's even necessary at this point
that that's even necessary at this point
for me the answer's like probably no
I mean like if we to me yeah I agree
I mean like if we to me yeah I agree
that right now we don't need it

that right now we don't need it
it's more like are we is it possible to

so basically basically
so basically basically

both of them put the access to
both of them put the access to
both of them put the access to

it's just one operation which is more

now the the difference in how these

like the idea is that you're going to

so you might imagine a situation where

like the you know you have

let's say you have an order and the

like the marginal price on the amn is at

right now but the amm has like really

so you might say like okay well first

I'm gonna trade against the amm
I'm gonna trade against the amm
I'm gonna trade against the amm
until the price hits a hundred dollars

then
then
then
i'll go and cross the order book and
i'll go and cross the order book and
i'll go and cross the order book and
take that first order
take that first order
take that first order
and then you know now I'm going to now
and then you know now I'm going to now
and then you know now I'm going to now
the next price is at 105 and so I'm
the next price is at 105 and so I'm
the next price is at 105 and so I'm
going to trade against the am until it
going to trade against the am until it
going to trade against the am until it
goes to 105 etc and you do both
goes to 105 etc and you do both
goes to 105 etc and you do both

have arbitrage

curve type it can be on any really

about fee so you can imagine having

two pools

two pools
on the same two constant product pools

let's say
let's say
let's say
on the same asset pair but one is going
