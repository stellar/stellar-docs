since we last discussed this there were
since we last discussed this there were
since we last discussed this there were
some small technical changes
some small technical changes
some small technical changes
there was also the addition of extra
there was also the addition of extra
there was also the addition of extra

ability to
just to say that this transaction
just to say that this transaction
just to say that this transaction
needs to be signed by

or a hash needs to be included with this

transaction to make it valid
transaction to make it valid

without having to store that hash as a

signer on the account so right now you
signer on the account so right now you

used
for cat 40 which we'll talk about later
would help for me to like overview the
would help for me to like overview the
other changes to cap 21

just because you know I think it was
just because you know I think it was
just because you know I think it was
already people were kind of generally
already people were kind of generally
already people were kind of generally
okay with it the last time we discussed
okay with it the last time we discussed
okay with it the last time we discussed
it and so a lot of these changes are

I think that would be super helpful yeah
I think that would be super helpful yeah
I think that would be super helpful yeah
great when you're working so yeah
great when you're working so yeah
great when you're working so yeah
so one of the changes
so one of the changes
so one of the changes
is that the previous version didn't
is that the previous version didn't
is that the previous version didn't
really talk about the
really talk about the
really talk about the
results and there's new failure modes
results and there's new failure modes
results and there's new failure modes
now because you've got these multiple
now because you've got these multiple
now because you've got these multiple
preconditions and so you might have sort
preconditions and so you might have sort
preconditions and so you might have sort
of multiple preconditions failing
of multiple preconditions failing
of multiple preconditions failing
and in particular you know you could
and in particular you know you could
and in particular you know you could
have preconditions failing
have preconditions failing
have preconditions failing
because it's too early or preconditions
because it's too early or preconditions
because it's too early or preconditions
failing because it's too late or both
failing because it's too late or both
failing because it's too late or both
and so what we basically said is if a
and so what we basically said is if a
and so what we basically said is if a
transaction can
transaction can
transaction can
never be valid again then even if
never be valid again then even if
never be valid again then even if
there's other things that are too early
there's other things that are too early
there's other things that are too early
we'll still call it too late
we'll still call it too late
we'll still call it too late
and we'll give the result code tx2 early
and we'll give the result code tx2 early
and we'll give the result code tx2 early
only in the case that
only in the case that
only in the case that
there is the possibility that the
there is the possibility that the
there is the possibility that the
transaction can be valid again if if
transaction can be valid again if if
transaction can be valid again if if
resubmitted at some later time
resubmitted at some later time
resubmitted at some later time
so basically if you have said a thing
so basically if you have said a thing
so basically if you have said a thing
that's too early and a thing that's too
that's too early and a thing that's too
that's too early and a thing that's too
late that gets combined to a too late
late that gets combined to a too late
late that gets combined to a too late
error

and so that fits it into like the
and so that fits it into like the
and so that fits it into like the
existing error codes and I think
existing error codes and I think
existing error codes and I think
you know preserves the sort of the
you know preserves the sort of the
you know preserves the sort of the
intuition if you're too late you can
intuition if you're too late you can
intuition if you're too late you can
never resubmit and if you're too early
never resubmit and if you're too early
never resubmit and if you're too early
there might be a chance of of
there might be a chance of of
there might be a chance of of
resubmitting at some later point
resubmitting at some later point
resubmitting at some later point
so other things that we changed
so other things that we changed
so other things that we changed
there's some some some
there's some some some
there's some some some
clarifications oh yeah the
clarifications oh yeah the
clarifications oh yeah the
the
the we kind of rearranged the stuff
the we kind of rearranged the stuff
that's dangling off
that's dangling off
that's dangling off
the account of the account entry
the account of the account entry

if you're actually sponsoring things
if you're actually sponsoring things

and so otherwise it's it's currently
and so otherwise it's it's currently
and so otherwise it's it's currently
null or it's
null or it's
null or it's
a v1 extension instead of v2 so we
a v1 extension instead of v2 so we
a v1 extension instead of v2 so we
changed that into a pointer and we just
changed that into a pointer and we just
changed that into a pointer and we just
kept the v2 data structure as a thing
kept the v2 data structure as a thing
kept the v2 data structure as a thing
that dangles off
that dangles off
that dangles off
the v3 now optionally if you're

actually using it
actually using it
actually using it
and then the final change is that we
and then the final change is that we

didn't talk about

entry extension v3 and so the answer was
entry extension v3 and so the answer was
