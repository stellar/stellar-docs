this fee is variable based on the

essentially we have a Target size and

the cost of right and R bums increase

in database size now there were two

now there's a couple of details here

particularly I want to talk about

the plan is to store all contract data
the plan is to store all contract data
the plan is to store all contract data
and all TTL entries in memory and then

to store instantiated contract code in
to store instantiated contract code in
to store instantiated contract code in

TTL the thing that we store is the
TTL the thing that we store is the
TTL the thing that we store is the
same size as the entry on disk so for

data on diss that's The Ledger entry

data on diss that's The Ledger entry
is you know 64 bytes then we store 64
is you know 64 bytes then we store 64
is you know 64 bytes then we store 64
bytes in memory so there's a one to one

this is not the case because of the

this is a 40 times increase but in the
