you know pieces of functionality that

but now we're going to go through the
but now we're going to go through the
but now we're going to go through the
steps that we're actually going to
steps that we're actually going to
steps that we're actually going to
deploy so so polaris can deploy any
deploy so so polaris can deploy any
deploy so so polaris can deploy any
number of steps
number of steps
number of steps
in any combination so you could you
in any combination so you could you
in any combination so you could you
could literally do polaris and just
could literally do polaris and just
could literally do polaris and just
deploy
deploy
deploy
step one which is a tomophile you
step one which is a tomophile you
step one which is a tomophile you
could deploy polaris and just do step
could deploy polaris and just do step
could deploy polaris and just do step
10.

you could do polaris with everything
you could do polaris with everything
you could do polaris with everything
you could do it with one of them missing
you could do it with one of them missing
you could do it with one of them missing
and so forth right so
and so forth right so
and so forth right so
we're going to set up polaris for step 1
we're going to set up polaris for step 1
we're going to set up polaris for step 1
10 and 24 and that encompasses
10 and 24 and that encompasses
10 and 24 and that encompasses
everything that's required in order to
everything that's required in order to
everything that's required in order to
successfully run a deposit withdrawal so
successfully run a deposit withdrawal so
successfully run a deposit withdrawal so
let's go to
let's go to
let's go to
step one the configuration required is
step one the configuration required is
step one the configuration required is
just to add it to our active steps list
just to add it to our active steps list
just to add it to our active steps list
so this active seps list in settings
so this active seps list in settings
so this active seps list in settings
is a key setting in polaris
is a key setting in polaris
is a key setting in polaris
it basically signals to polaris what
it basically signals to polaris what
it basically signals to polaris what
we're running what what kind
we're running what what kind
we're running what what kind
what standards do we want to actually

going to run them all by default right
going to run them all by default right
you may just want one of them so we're
you may just want one of them so we're
you may just want one of them so we're
going to add step 1 to our active steps
going to add step 1 to our active steps
going to add step 1 to our active steps

and we're actually going to add step 10
and we're actually going to add step 10
and we're actually going to add step 10
and step 24 as well
and step 24 as well
and step 24 as well
and this is going to tell polaris what

okay that's actually all that's required
okay that's actually all that's required

django would complain to you about it so

you'd figure it out

cool okay so I just added the

just look at the distribution account
just look at the distribution account
it generates the account from the seed
