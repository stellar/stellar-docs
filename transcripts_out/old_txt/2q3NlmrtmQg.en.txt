that I I'll discuss in a moment. But
that I I'll discuss in a moment. But
that I I'll discuss in a moment. But
before I move on, does anyone have any
questions? All right. Then then I'll
questions? All right. Then then I'll
move on to the the cap 63 change. One
move on to the the cap 63 change. One
move on to the the cap 63 change. One
sec. Can can everyone hear
me? Okay. Yeah. Then yeah, I'll move
me? Okay. Yeah. Then yeah, I'll move
on to the cap 63 change. which is the
on to the cap 63 change. which is the
on to the cap 63 change. which is the
a change to apply the fee refunds after

all sorbond transactions have been
all sorbond transactions have been

this is an issue because it's possible
this is an issue because it's possible
this is an issue because it's possible
for that same account to be used in a
