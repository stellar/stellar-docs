basically where your contracts are going
basically where your contracts are going
basically where your contracts are going
to live. They are following this format

different example of contract. So
different example of contract. So
different example of contract. So
contracts is where your rust code
contracts is where your rust code
contracts is where your rust code
exists. This is all a big workspace and
exists. This is all a big workspace and
exists. This is all a big workspace and
you can see the the source code
you can see the the source code
you can see the the source code
directly. If you scroll a little bit,
directly. If you scroll a little bit,
directly. If you scroll a little bit,
you see packages. Right now, this is
you see packages. Right now, this is
you see packages. Right now, this is
empty. So where is this packages folder?
empty. So where is this packages folder?
empty. So where is this packages folder?
The idea is that as I'm building these
The idea is that as I'm building these
The idea is that as I'm building these
contracts, we are automatically

going through our configuration and
going through our configuration and
going through our configuration and
deploying these contracts and generating
deploying these contracts and generating
deploying these contracts and generating
the TypeScript binds. So we are creating
the TypeScript binds. So we are creating
the TypeScript binds. So we are creating
clients for these in Typescript and
clients for these in Typescript and
clients for these in Typescript and
putting those in this folder. So all the
putting those in this folder. So all the
putting those in this folder. So all the
clients that are generated for the
clients that are generated for the
clients that are generated for the
contracts will come to the package

But in short summary, what you're seeing

But in short summary, what you're seeing
is you have three main environments. You

for example and I'm running npm rundev,
for example and I'm running npm rundev,
for example and I'm running npm rundev,
it's going to automatically start the
it's going to automatically start the
it's going to automatically start the

that or in case I forget. I do this all
that or in case I forget. I do this all
that or in case I forget. I do this all
the time whenever I'm working on my

this is also very neat. I'll get to into

more details but important things here
more details but important things here
more details but important things here
is that you also have other

I can you can see the keys I have. It

I can you can see the keys I have. It
allow you to manage key pairs directly
allow you to manage key pairs directly
allow you to manage key pairs directly
from the CLI. So you can create new key

deploy the contracts as the source of
deploy the contracts as the source of
deploy the contracts as the source of
the transactions. So for example, if you
the transactions. So for example, if you
the transactions. So for example, if you
are spinning up a bunch of contracts
are spinning up a bunch of contracts
are spinning up a bunch of contracts
which have the same admin, you could set
which have the same admin, you could set
which have the same admin, you could set
up this as the admin account and have

the admin deploy all the contracts.
the admin deploy all the contracts.
the admin deploy all the contracts.
down below you have here also the

comes out of the bat already
comes out of the bat already
comes out of the bat already
preconfigured with the contracts we have
preconfigured with the contracts we have
preconfigured with the contracts we have
here as examples. So you have the hello

world and this inline syntax saying
that I want to generate the client for
that I want to generate the client for
that I want to generate the client for
it. So basically the hello world down

below we have the funible token which
below we have the funible token which
below we have the funible token which
also is generating the clients but you
also is generating the clients but you
also is generating the clients but you
can see down below it has something
can see down below it has something
can see down below it has something
else. You can already set the

and the same thing for the NFT contract
as well. It's set in the owner and you

can also play around with these because
can also play around with these because
can also play around with these because
you can add post initialization
you can add post initialization
you can add post initialization
commands. So you can have for example

commands after everything is deployed if
commands after everything is deployed if
you want to run a specific

deploying everything and initializing
deploying everything and initializing
deploying everything and initializing
the contract you already want out of the
the contract you already want out of the

bat to mint some units to send to some
bat to mint some units to send to some

accounts to send around some tokens. So
you can do that very easily. So you see
you can do that very easily. So you see
you can do that very easily. So you see
a lot of stuff ran here. Actually I
a lot of stuff ran here. Actually I
a lot of stuff ran here. Actually I
ended up jumping a few steps. So we
ended up jumping a few steps. So we
ended up jumping a few steps. So we
just have the the the contracts and the
just have the the the contracts and the
just have the the the contracts and the
packages and you can see those were
packages and you can see those were
packages and you can see those were
generated based on the contracts we have
generated based on the contracts we have
generated based on the contracts we have
specified here. So all of the TypeScript
specified here. So all of the TypeScript

packages and this also filled in the

no change in state. We're not changing
no change in state. We're not changing
no change in state. We're not changing
any state of the contract. So there's no
any state of the contract. So there's no

real reason to actually submit and pay
real reason to actually submit and pay
real reason to actually submit and pay
for the fees. If we just want to fetch
for the fees. If we just want to fetch
for the fees. If we just want to fetch
some value or see some result, we can
some value or see some result, we can

just simulate and see the result which
just simulate and see the result which

the whole routine. So it redeploys,
the whole routine. So it redeploys,
the whole routine. So it redeploys,
reinitializes. And this is very very
reinitializes. And this is very very
reinitializes. And this is very very
powerful because it means that as I'm
powerful because it means that as I'm
powerful because it means that as I'm
making changes, it's identifying when
making changes, it's identifying when
making changes, it's identifying when
it's relevant and it redeploys. It
it's relevant and it redeploys. It

front end already updated here on the
side. So I already have the starv
side. So I already have the starv
side. So I already have the starv
showing up in here. So that's really
showing up in here. So that's really
showing up in here. So that's really
neat because it means that as I'm making
neat because it means that as I'm making
neat because it means that as I'm making
changes, I can already invoke from the
changes, I can already invoke from the
changes, I can already invoke from the
front end. So the star val here allow me
front end. So the star val here allow me
front end. So the star val here allow me
to send an address. So I'll just copy my

definitely add the copy button here. So
definitely add the copy button here. So
definitely add the copy button here. So
I'll just paste it here. I'll simulate.
I'll just paste it here. I'll simulate.
I'll just paste it here. I'll simulate.
I see that I can send it. I can submit
I see that I can send it. I can submit
I see that I can send it. I can submit

this. But if you notice here on top now,
this. But if you notice here on top now,
the badge is slightly different. Let me
the badge is slightly different. Let me
the badge is slightly different. Let me
close this. You see now it indicates
close this. You see now it indicates
close this. You see now it indicates
it's a right invocation. So this means
it's a right invocation. So this means
it's a right invocation. So this means
that based on this simulation if I
that based on this simulation if I
that based on this simulation if I
submit this I'll be changing some
submit this I'll be changing some
submit this I'll be changing some
value and storing some value in the

noticed already all of the functions are
noticed already all of the functions are
noticed already all of the functions are
loaded here with their specific
loaded here with their specific
loaded here with their specific
arguments and the specific types that
arguments and the specific types that
arguments and the specific types that
these arguments are in. So for example,
these arguments are in. So for example,
these arguments are in. So for example,
if you're looking here to the hello, it
if you're looking here to the hello, it
if you're looking here to the hello, it
expects an SC string. So it's only
expects an SC string. So it's only
expects an SC string. So it's only
accepting strings. So as I'm typing
accepting strings. So as I'm typing
accepting strings. So as I'm typing
here, it's validating the the the input
here, it's validating the the the input
here, it's validating the the the input
that I'm providing. So for example, here
that I'm providing. So for example, here
that I'm providing. So for example, here
it expects an address for the store. If
it expects an address for the store. If
it expects an address for the store. If

you'll see that it's validating and
telling me, hey, this is not a public

telling me, hey, this is not a public
key or a contract ID. So it needs to be
key or a contract ID. So it needs to be
key or a contract ID. So it needs to be
a valid address. And you should see this
a valid address. And you should see this
a valid address. And you should see this
for all of your functions, all of the
for all of your functions, all of the
for all of your functions, all of the
the known types. So if you go here over
the known types. So if you go here over
the known types. So if you go here over
the funible token for example, you see
the funible token for example, you see
the funible token for example, you see
we have all of these types indicated
we have all of these types indicated
we have all of these types indicated
here along with the fields. So we have
here along with the fields. So we have
here along with the fields. So we have
here I 128 and so on. And for functions
here I 128 and so on. And for functions
here I 128 and so on. And for functions
that don't have like arguments don't
that don't have like arguments don't
that don't have like arguments don't
expect arguments you just see this
expect arguments you just see this
expect arguments you just see this
compact version. So you can just check
compact version. So you can just check
