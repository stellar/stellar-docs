and so I guess my question is does

anyone have any questions about this

does this change make sense

are there any concerns
so when we did this I think siddharth
so when we did this I think siddharth
might have made this change yes
might have made this change yes

siddharth made this change but
siddharth made this change but
siddharth made this change but



sir do you want to talk about or do you

yeah I can talk about it so the
yeah I can talk about it so the
yeah I can talk about it so the
reasoning for this is that the

in the original capital

id was under a union

electric key didn't have the liquidity
electric key didn't have the liquidity
electric key didn't have the liquidity
pool id under a union so
pool id under a union so

you know which means that every type of

liquidity pool entry would need that
liquidity pool entry would need that
liquidity pool entry would need that
that id
that id
that id
so you might as well just take it to the

the level above that
the level above that
the level above that
instead of specifying it for each new
instead of specifying it for each new

union we specify in the future so
union we specify in the future so
union we specify in the future so
that was the reason for this
and the general assumption here is like

probably we're going to keep referencing

things by hash anyway there's no reason

things by hash anyway there's no reason
to think that we would change the
to think that we would change the

so we might change our hash function
so we might change our hash function
so we might change our hash function

just going to be a pain anyway

I think it would be pain no matter what

just need to update your xcr files
I like that precedent

okay
okay
any other questions about that change
looks like the next two are added new
looks like the next two are added new

okay any anyone have any thoughts
okay any anyone have any thoughts
questions
all right the next one is changed
all right the next one is changed
to m32t in liquidity pool use count
yeah I can take this this is this is
yeah I can take this this is this is
following

range checks seem to have changed

so you can't have more than
I don't know I'm not sure what the exact
I don't know I'm not sure what the exact
I don't know I'm not sure what the exact

this is on the trust lines like the pool
this is on the trust lines like the pool

so it's like a per account counter
so it's like a per account counter
so it's like a per account counter
yeah sorry okay maybe say what this
yeah sorry okay maybe say what this
yeah sorry okay maybe say what this
what is a count what is the use of a
what is a count what is the use of a

but now you go through the liquidity

pool side you actually can do the

you don't satisfy the the constru the

obviously super inefficient for no gains
so
so
yeah okay and so to be totally clear

there's no such thing as a path payment
