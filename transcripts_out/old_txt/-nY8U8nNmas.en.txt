yeah so what's the the problem that we
yeah so what's the the problem that we

are facing is that in Latin America

there are a lot of infrastructure
there are a lot of infrastructure
there are a lot of infrastructure
operators that are lacking fund and they

then request for a loan then go through
then request for a loan then go through
then request for a loan then go through
all the bureaucracy of the bank. but
all the bureaucracy of the bank. but

then also time moves and they need
then also time moves and they need

the the money to deploy and to create

this new infrastructure that is not

risky by itself but maybe the banks

consider is risky because of the type of

traditional credit a loan for for a

country also for example we've recently
country also for example we've recently
country also for example we've recently
seen in Argentina how this country
seen in Argentina how this country
seen in Argentina how this country
was facing high inflation rates or
was facing high inflation rates or
was facing high inflation rates or
similar situation with Venezuela
similar situation with Venezuela
similar situation with Venezuela
and other countries in Latin America
and other countries in Latin America
and other countries in Latin America
with high inflation rates that then
with high inflation rates that then
with high inflation rates that then
this ties those loans to higher interest
this ties those loans to higher interest
this ties those loans to higher interest
rates plus the the risk on the country
rates plus the the risk on the country
rates plus the the risk on the country
itself.

so there's this problem of banks
so there's this problem of banks
so there's this problem of banks
because of these situations not
because of these situations not
because of these situations not

at the same time if the
at the same time if the
