 Great. So
ster hacks with the ster hacks you can
ster hacks with the ster hacks you can
swap and build build vaults with palas
swap and build build vaults with palas
swap and build build vaults with palas
source app and defendex.
So let's talk a bit about source and
So let's talk a bit about source and
then we will talk a bit about defendex.
then we will talk a bit about defendex.
then we will talk a bit about defendex.
If you have questions I think you can
If you have questions I think you can
If you have questions I think you can
write them in the chat right. So I will
write them in the chat right. So I will
write them in the chat right. So I will
stop if anyone has any questions we will
stop if anyone has any questions we will
stop if anyone has any questions we will
stop there and maybe we can share more
stop there and maybe we can share more
stop there and maybe we can share more
our screens we can take a look at the
our screens we can take a look at the

have like a swap that

and Clinics AMMs.
In order for you to understand like the
In order for you to understand like the
tech of Soros and so you can have

like more ideas on how you can hack and
like more ideas on how you can hack and

our road API is the one that will that
our road API is the one that will that
our road API is the one that will that
that will that will optimize

your trade that will be executed on
your trade that will be executed on

that will go through source AMM it will
that will go through source AMM it will
that will go through source AMM it will
go through our pools.
Source of AMM is where you can create
Source of AMM is where you can create
liquidity pools. If you want to do like
liquidity pools. If you want to do like
liquidity pools. If you want to do like
a simple swap or if you are building a a
a simple swap or if you are building a a
a simple swap or if you are building a a
protocol that needs a liquidity pool,
protocol that needs a liquidity pool,
protocol that needs a liquidity pool,
you can create a list liquidity pool on
you can create a list liquidity pool on
you can create a list liquidity pool on
our AMM. It's a classic swap version two
our AMM. It's a classic swap version two
our AMM. It's a classic swap version two
type of AMM. And we have a router
type of AMM. And we have a router

contract that does everything for you.

contract that does everything for you.
So you can create new pairs through the
So you can create new pairs through the
So you can create new pairs through the
rotor contract. You can add liquidity
rotor contract. You can add liquidity
rotor contract. You can add liquidity
through the router contract. remove
through the router contract. remove
through the router contract. remove
liquidity and swap through only one
liquidity and swap through only one
liquidity and swap through only one
contract. So you only need to understand
contract. So you only need to understand
contract. So you only need to understand
this one router contract and
this one router contract and
this one router contract and
we will put the links later but it's

are in that core repository.
now I am reading the comments sorry.
now I am reading the comments sorry.
Yeah hacks. Yeah let's go. Great. And
Yeah hacks. Yeah let's go. Great. And

then we have the aggregator. If you
then we have the aggregator. If you
then we have the aggregator. If you
want to aggregate multiple protocols we
want to aggregate multiple protocols we
want to aggregate multiple protocols we
already built a contract that handles
already built a contract that handles
already built a contract that handles
all those transactions. So you don't
all those transactions. So you don't

need to think about aqua. You don't need

need only need to inter interact with

need only need to inter interact with
only one contract and then inside that

aggregator contract we have we have all
aggregator contract we have we have all
aggregator contract we have we have all
the adapters that will help your
the adapters that will help your
the adapters that will help your
transaction go through all those
transaction go through all those
transaction go through all those
different AMMs
different AMMs
different AMMs
next slide please.
next slide please.
next slide please.
So this is how it looks a transaction
So this is how it looks a transaction
So this is how it looks a transaction
through the
through the
through the
simple. So you just put token in, token
simple. So you just put token in, token
simple. So you just put token in, token
out, the amount you want in, the minimum
out, the amount you want in, the minimum
out, the amount you want in, the minimum
amount you want out, and but the tricky
amount you want out, and but the tricky
amount you want out, and but the tricky
part is this dex distribution like how
part is this dex distribution like how
part is this dex distribution like how
you distribute your trade between
you distribute your trade between
you distribute your trade between
different exchanges, between different
different exchanges, between different
different exchanges, between different
dexes.
And this is how yeah, no next one.
And this is how yeah, no next one.
So you will need to create this object
So you will need to create this object
So you will need to create this object
but you don't need to calculate it
but you don't need to calculate it
but you don't need to calculate it
yourself. We have it in our road API.

yeah one one back sorry the yeah this
yeah one one back sorry the yeah this
yeah one one back sorry the yeah this
one. this is how the transaction
one. this is how the transaction

looks like on the
looks like on the
looks like on the
on the ster on the ster explorer. so
on the ster on the ster explorer. so
on the ster on the ster explorer. so
you put like how many parts you want of
you put like how many parts you want of
you put like how many parts you want of
one trade to go through protocol zero
one trade to go through protocol zero
one trade to go through protocol zero
which is Aquarius how much part you
which is Aquarius how much part you
which is Aquarius how much part you
want to protocol two which is source up
want to protocol two which is source up
want to protocol two which is source up
yeah
yeah
yeah
any questions until now no through this
any questions until now no through this
any questions until now no through this
aggregator you can touch all those
aggregator you can touch all those
aggregator you can touch all those
liquidity sources it's only one contract

that your app or something that you are
that your app or something that you are

building needs to interact with it's

only one contract and this contract will

execute all transactions and will do all
execute all transactions and will do all
execute all transactions and will do all
these subcontract calls necessary for
these subcontract calls necessary for
these subcontract calls necessary for
that trade to go through.
So how do you get this optimal vector of
So how do you get this optimal vector of
dex distribution? You can calculate
dex distribution? You can calculate
dex distribution? You can calculate
yourself or you can force it. So you
yourself or you can force it. So you
yourself or you can force it. So you
want you can force it to go through
want you can force it to go through
want you can force it to go through
like specific protocols. That's also

And then we have the vaults. The vaults
And then we have the vaults. The vaults
And then we have the vaults. The vaults
are the savings accounts. it handles

all the fee distribution,
all the fee distribution,
all the fee distribution,
all the accounting for users.
all the accounting for users.
all the accounting for users.
It manage all the the
It manage all the the
It manage all the the
how many users you have, which which
how many users you have, which which
how many users you have, which which
user has
the the amount of the of the funds that
the the amount of the of the funds that
any user has etc.
any user has etc.
any user has etc.
So let's see an example. So this is
So let's see an example. So this is
So let's see an example. So this is
the blended strategy that we have right
the blended strategy that we have right
the blended strategy that we have right
now. We have it for USDC euro C also. So
now. We have it for USDC euro C also. So
now. We have it for USDC euro C also. So
we basically we lend USDC
we basically we lend USDC
we basically we lend USDC
to blend on in a blend pool. We
to blend on in a blend pool. We
to blend on in a blend pool. We
harvest the blend rewards. We swap this
harvest the blend rewards. We swap this
harvest the blend rewards. We swap this
blend rewards for more USDC and we lend
blend rewards for more USDC and we lend
blend rewards for more USDC and we lend
again. So we get this autoco compounding
again. So we get this autoco compounding
again. So we get this autoco compounding
effect on the on the blend blending and
effect on the on the blend blending and
effect on the on the blend blending and
borrowing protocol.
Then we on the b contract we can include
Then we on the b contract we can include
multiple strategies. So we you can
multiple strategies. So we you can
multiple strategies. So we you can
expose the users to multiple pools. In
expose the users to multiple pools. In
expose the users to multiple pools. In
this case, we we have this USDC strategy
this case, we we have this USDC strategy
this case, we we have this USDC strategy
on the blend fixed pool and on the blend
on the blend fixed pool and on the blend
on the blend fixed pool and on the blend
gel blocks pool at the same time. So
gel blocks pool at the same time. So
gel blocks pool at the same time. So
when a user deposits into the B
when a user deposits into the B
when a user deposits into the B
contract, the funds are distributed
contract, the funds are distributed
contract, the funds are distributed
automatically on both pools. also if
automatically on both pools. also if
automatically on both pools. also if
you want to you can have like one 100%
you want to you can have like one 100%
you want to you can have like one 100%
of the money in just one strategy. But
of the money in just one strategy. But
of the money in just one strategy. But
that could change in the future. So you
that could change in the future. So you
that could change in the future. So you
can move all the fonts of your users to
can move all the fonts of your users to
can move all the fonts of your users to
the the other strategy that is
the the other strategy that is
the the other strategy that is
performing better. And
performing better. And
performing better. And
that the the good thing is that the user
that the the good thing is that the user
that the the good thing is that the user
don't need to know that their phones
don't need to know that their phones
don't need to know that their phones
were moved.

You just move it. but also you as a
You just move it. but also you as a
You just move it. but also you as a
manager of the vault you you cannot take
manager of the vault you you cannot take
manager of the vault you you cannot take
the the funds of the user out.
then so this is what we have right
then so this is what we have right
now. So if someone wants to create a new

don't need to specify the distribution.
don't need to specify the distribution.
don't need to specify the distribution.
So you don't have to hassle to do the
So you don't have to hassle to do the
So you don't have to hassle to do the
paths. That's not completely right
