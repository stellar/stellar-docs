it was in I think it was in December,
it was in I think it was in December,
it was in I think it was in December,
early December we had the latest the
early December we had the latest the
early December we had the latest the
last presentation of Stellar Labs but
last presentation of Stellar Labs but
last presentation of Stellar Labs but
a lot has happened since then. So I'm
a lot has happened since then. So I'm
a lot has happened since then. So I'm
super excited about learning more
super excited about learning more
super excited about learning more
about the new features and yeah take

also do XDR if you want. You can copy.
You can also download the WASM. So,
You can also download the WASM. So,
You can also download the WASM. So,
let's say you're building a contract to
let's say you're building a contract to
let's say you're building a contract to

also have smart contract
also have smart contract
also have smart contract
list which shows us all the smart

make
this load much faster we are going to
this load much faster we are going to
this load much faster we are going to
work on implementing back end so that it
work on implementing back end so that it
work on implementing back end so that it
will be more efficient and faster.

will be more efficient and faster.
but yeah, give it some
but yeah, give it some
but yeah, give it some

time or I can also

refresh. Should I
refresh? Let me refresh. Okay. Yes.
refresh? Let me refresh. Okay. Yes.
so yeah, all the smart contracts are
happening. I can just click on it and
happening. I can just click on it and
then we can just load it right away and
then we can just load it right away and
then we can just load it right away and
check out what's going on. So yeah, so
check out what's going on. So yeah, so
check out what's going on. So yeah, so
that

developer can really utilize the lab to
developer can really utilize the lab to
developer can really utilize the lab to
make their workflow much better. So I'm
make their workflow much better. So I'm
