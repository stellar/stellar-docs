today we're going to be talking about

State exploration so without further

Ado I'm gonna hand it over to Garand
yeah so I know we haven't talked
yeah so I know we haven't talked
about the expiration in a second but I
about the expiration in a second but I
about the expiration in a second but I
think before we were kind of talking
think before we were kind of talking
think before we were kind of talking
high level what the interface wanted
high level what the interface wanted
high level what the interface wanted
to be and then now we're actually
to be and then now we're actually
to be and then now we're actually
starting to implement pieces of it and
starting to implement pieces of it and
starting to implement pieces of it and
so kind of the timeline for this is
so kind of the timeline for this is
so kind of the timeline for this is
first we're going to start charging for
first we're going to start charging for
first we're going to start charging for
rent on futurenet but not actually have
rent on futurenet but not actually have
rent on futurenet but not actually have
any penalties for a rent balance of zero
any penalties for a rent balance of zero
any penalties for a rent balance of zero
or negative just so that we can make
or negative just so that we can make
or negative just so that we can make
sure that you know the the rent is
sure that you know the the rent is
sure that you know the the rent is
being charged correct and that sort of
being charged correct and that sort of
being charged correct and that sort of
stuff Next Step will then be to add
stuff Next Step will then be to add
stuff Next Step will then be to add
ways to a bump rent but again still
ways to a bump rent but again still
ways to a bump rent but again still
with no consequences on futurenet and
with no consequences on futurenet and
with no consequences on futurenet and
then once we have the the rent bump
then once we have the the rent bump
then once we have the the rent bump
and the rent charging correctly
and the rent charging correctly
and the rent charging correctly
implemented will actually enable
implemented will actually enable
implemented will actually enable
consequences and essentially what that
consequences and essentially what that
consequences and essentially what that
means is that an entry will need to have
means is that an entry will need to have
means is that an entry will need to have
a non-zero or non-negative rent balance
a non-zero or non-negative rent balance
a non-zero or non-negative rent balance
to be usable but we still won't actually
to be usable but we still won't actually
to be usable but we still won't actually
be sending entries to the archive and
be sending entries to the archive and
be sending entries to the archive and
doing them from The Ledger for some time
doing them from The Ledger for some time
doing them from The Ledger for some time
still in addition to that once the rent

system is in place we'll then roll out

temporary entries which are the entry

a certain amount of ledgers and the CTL

is variable and so I know we've talked
is variable and so I know we've talked
is variable and so I know we've talked
about kind of like at a high level
about kind of like at a high level
about kind of like at a high level
but we're actually starting to
but we're actually starting to
but we're actually starting to
implement this rent stuff and so there's
implement this rent stuff and so there's
implement this rent stuff and so there's
a couple of open questions both in the
a couple of open questions both in the
a couple of open questions both in the
rent proposal and in the temporary

rent proposal and in the temporary
storage proposal that we want to talk
storage proposal that we want to talk
storage proposal that we want to talk
about in detail

so when we initially talked we didn't
so when we initially talked we didn't
so when we initially talked we didn't
have automatic rent payments on access

have automatic rent payments on access
and this was an implementation issue
and this was an implementation issue
and this was an implementation issue
with the way the bucket list is
with the way the bucket list is
with the way the bucket list is
structured however now we've changed the
structured however now we've changed the
structured however now we've changed the
way in which we actually record rent
way in which we actually record rent
way in which we actually record rent
balances on Ledger and so we can bump
balances on Ledger and so we can bump
balances on Ledger and so we can bump
rent on every access and so with that in
rent on every access and so with that in
rent on every access and so with that in
mind we've changed the way that we
mind we've changed the way that we
mind we've changed the way that we
structure run payments how it currently

this isn't expected to be a very
this isn't expected to be a very
this isn't expected to be a very
large rent bump but it's something small
large rent bump but it's something small
large rent bump but it's something small
and automatic now this includes not only

contract data that's accessed but also
contract data that's accessed but also
contract data that's accessed but also
the contract instance itself and also
the contract instance itself and also
the contract instance itself and also
the contract wasm code and so this also
the contract wasm code and so this also
the contract wasm code and so this also
allows you to bump the smart contract
allows you to bump the smart contract
allows you to bump the smart contract
itself and the smart contract code

without needing any extra intervention

and because this is a small incremental

bump that's bumped automatically it

means that smart contracts and entries

something like usdc that's used every

these automatic bumps to never have to
these automatic bumps to never have to

worry about doing a manual run bump

and so this automatic interface is a lot
and so this automatic interface is a lot
and so this automatic interface is a lot
easier and covers a lot of the weird

we want to expose for the quote-unquote

manual rent bumps
manual rent bumps
manual rent bumps
and so this we have two kind of fields
and so this we have two kind of fields
and so this we have two kind of fields
of thought here
of thought here
of thought here
so what a manual run bump is is say you
so what a manual run bump is is say you
so what a manual run bump is is say you
have an entry that's not accessed very
have an entry that's not accessed very
have an entry that's not accessed very
often so you have like a token balance
often so you have like a token balance
often so you have like a token balance
that you only use every six months or
that you only use every six months or
that you only use every six months or
one year but when you use it you want it
one year but when you use it you want it
one year but when you use it you want it
to be accessible very fast and so you
to be accessible very fast and so you
to be accessible very fast and so you
want to be I'm not in the archive and
want to be I'm not in the archive and
want to be I'm not in the archive and
remain on The Ledger so automatic rent
remain on The Ledger so automatic rent
remain on The Ledger so automatic rent
bumps are not sufficient for this use
bumps are not sufficient for this use
bumps are not sufficient for this use
case because you're not accessing it
case because you're not accessing it
case because you're not accessing it
very often and so the automatic rent
very often and so the automatic rent
very often and so the automatic rent
bumps aren't large enough to keep this
bumps aren't large enough to keep this
bumps aren't large enough to keep this
wallet or this token balance on The
wallet or this token balance on The
wallet or this token balance on The
Ledger and so we want an interface where
Ledger and so we want an interface where
Ledger and so we want an interface where
a user can do a explicit manual rent
a user can do a explicit manual rent
a user can do a explicit manual rent
bump instead of doing the small
bump instead of doing the small

incremental run bump say I want six
incremental run bump say I want six
incremental run bump say I want six
months or one year or 10 years or
months or one year or 10 years or
months or one year or 10 years or
something like that of rent for this
something like that of rent for this
something like that of rent for this
entry

and so kind of the two ways to do that
and so kind of the two ways to do that
and so kind of the two ways to do that
are either a via a manual operation
are either a via a manual operation
are either a via a manual operation
where the invoker of the operation
where the invoker of the operation
where the invoker of the operation
specifies the set of keys that they want
specifies the set of keys that they want
specifies the set of keys that they want
to bump
to bump
to bump
and so this is the the most manual
and so this is the the most manual
and so this is the the most manual
approach but it's also
approach but it's also
approach but it's also
has some benefits one of the significant

calling this function needs to know what

easy so in for instance in a token

contract you may be able to have just

one entry and one key for each user's
one entry and one key for each user's

other entries that are also associated
other entries that are also associated
other entries that are also associated
with your account in addition to that
with your account in addition to that

balance entry so for instance a token
balance entry so for instance a token

contract may also have a nonce that's
contract may also have a nonce that's
contract may also have a nonce that's
required to do transactions with your
required to do transactions with your

token balance and if a user only knows
token balance and if a user only knows
token balance and if a user only knows
about the token balance ID but doesn't
about the token balance ID but doesn't
about the token balance ID but doesn't
know about the non-sid they may pay a
know about the non-sid they may pay a
know about the non-sid they may pay a
bunch of rent on their token balance and
bunch of rent on their token balance and
bunch of rent on their token balance and
have that active on The Ledger but then
have that active on The Ledger but then
have that active on The Ledger but then
in six months when they want to do their
in six months when they want to do their
in six months when they want to do their
transaction they didn't pay rent on the
transaction they didn't pay rent on the
transaction they didn't pay rent on the
non-century and so they still have to
non-century and so they still have to
non-century and so they still have to
wait to get the nonce value out of the
wait to get the nonce value out of the
wait to get the nonce value out of the
archive
archive

and so one approach to this is to allow
and so one approach to this is to allow
and so one approach to this is to allow
the contract to Define rent bump
the contract to Define rent bump
the contract to Define rent bump
behavior and we do this by exposing a
behavior and we do this by exposing a
behavior and we do this by exposing a
rep bump host function to the smart
rep bump host function to the smart
rep bump host function to the smart
contracts and what this allows contracts
contracts and what this allows contracts
contracts and what this allows contracts
to do is to codify on the contract
to do is to codify on the contract
to do is to codify on the contract
itself rent bump behavior in addition to
itself rent bump behavior in addition to
itself rent bump behavior in addition to
the automatic rent bumps and so in our
the automatic rent bumps and so in our
the automatic rent bumps and so in our
token contract example say that there is
token contract example say that there is
token contract example say that there is
both a rent balance and also a nonce
both a rent balance and also a nonce
both a rent balance and also a nonce
that are have separate Keys now I'm not

saying this is a the most efficient
saying this is a the most efficient
saying this is a the most efficient
approach but this is an approach
approach but this is an approach
approach but this is an approach
and so what the contract could do is it
and so what the contract could do is it
and so what the contract could do is it
could Define a bump my account function
could Define a bump my account function
could Define a bump my account function
and this bumped my account function I
and this bumped my account function I
and this bumped my account function I
will use the host function to bump both
will use the host function to bump both
will use the host function to bump both
the token balance and also the nonce
the token balance and also the nonce
the token balance and also the nonce
value associated with the user and so in
value associated with the user and so in
value associated with the user and so in
this way the user can just call the bump
this way the user can just call the bump
this way the user can just call the bump
my account or about my account function
my account or about my account function
my account or about my account function
and then bump their account by six
and then bump their account by six
and then bump their account by six
months a year the specified amount or
months a year the specified amount or
months a year the specified amount or
however much is codified in the smart
however much is codified in the smart
however much is codified in the smart
contract and this allows the smart
contract and this allows the smart
contract and this allows the smart
contract developers to abstract away a
contract developers to abstract away a
contract developers to abstract away a
lot of the Run interface to the user and
lot of the Run interface to the user and
lot of the Run interface to the user and
so the user still can bump run manually
so the user still can bump run manually
so the user still can bump run manually
but doesn't need to know exactly what

access by 10 ledgers worth of rent but

then the smart contract developer might
