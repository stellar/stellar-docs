so yeah a couple of months ago or a few
so yeah a couple of months ago or a few
so yeah a couple of months ago or a few
months ago we started working on a
months ago we started working on a
months ago we started working on a
Stellar integration for this tool and in
Stellar integration for this tool and in
Stellar integration for this tool and in
doing so we now offer full Soroban
doing so we now offer full Soroban
doing so we now offer full Soroban
smart contract functionality. So it

allows users to deploy contracts through
allows users to deploy contracts through
allows users to deploy contracts through
the OpenZeppelin relayer. They can

but there there are some limitations
but there there are some limitations
but there there are some limitations
to how you can send transactions
to how you can send transactions
to how you can send transactions
through the Stellar network and and one

scalability like high throughput
scalability like high throughput
scalability like high throughput
transactions. And so we were working
transactions. And so we were working
transactions. And so we were working
towards developing some features
towards developing some features
towards developing some features
within the relayer that will allow the
within the relayer that will allow the
within the relayer that will allow the
Stellar relayers to scale larger. And
Stellar relayers to scale larger. And
Stellar relayers to scale larger. And
one of the the features that enabled us
one of the the features that enabled us
one of the the features that enabled us
to do this was the relayer plug-in
to do this was the relayer plug-in
to do this was the relayer plug-in
system. So in a nutshell what this does
system. So in a nutshell what this does
system. So in a nutshell what this does
is allows us to extend a standard
is allows us to extend a standard
is allows us to extend a standard
relayer with ex with further
relayer with ex with further
relayer with ex with further
functionality. So from a developer's
functionality. So from a developer's
functionality. So from a developer's
perspective, what you would do is write
perspective, what you would do is write
perspective, what you would do is write
some TypeScript code and inside this
some TypeScript code and inside this
some TypeScript code and inside this
plug-in, you would have access to the
plug-in, you would have access to the
plug-in, you would have access to the
relay system for submitting
relay system for submitting
relay system for submitting
transactions, signing transactions,
transactions, signing transactions,
transactions, signing transactions,
querying state, etc. And you would still
querying state, etc. And you would still
querying state, etc. And you would still
communicate to the to the OpenZeppelin
communicate to the to the OpenZeppelin
communicate to the to the OpenZeppelin
relayer through the the rest API, but
relayer through the the rest API, but
relayer through the the rest API, but
you would be calling this plug-in
you would be calling this plug-in
you would be calling this plug-in
directly. And in the case of Stellar,
directly. And in the case of Stellar,
directly. And in the case of Stellar,
we've used this system for developing a
we've used this system for developing a
we've used this system for developing a
channels plug-in. So the channels
channels plug-in. So the channels
channels plug-in. So the channels
plug-in allows allows users to submit
plug-in allows allows users to submit
plug-in allows allows users to submit
transactions in parallel and the the key
transactions in parallel and the the key
transactions in parallel and the the key
workflow here is that we use channel
workflow here is that we use channel
workflow here is that we use channel
accounts for building the transaction.
accounts for building the transaction.
accounts for building the transaction.
So in this plug-in system in this spec
So in this plug-in system in this spec
So in this plug-in system in this spec
specific plug-in called the channels
specific plug-in called the channels
specific plug-in called the channels
plug-in we manage a pool of channel
plug-in we manage a pool of channel
plug-in we manage a pool of channel
channel accounts and the user sends a
channel accounts and the user sends a
channel accounts and the user sends a
request and we acquire a channel
request and we acquire a channel
request and we acquire a channel
account. We sign the user's transaction
account. We sign the user's transaction
account. We sign the user's transaction
with that channel account and then we
with that channel account and then we
with that channel account and then we
submit it to the Stellar network with
submit it to the Stellar network with
submit it to the Stellar network with
a fee bump transaction as well. So it's
a fee bump transaction as well. So it's
a fee bump transaction as well. So it's
also gasless. so yeah parallel
also gasless. so yeah parallel
also gasless. so yeah parallel
transaction processing automatic fee
transaction processing automatic fee
transaction processing automatic fee
bumping and this includes an SDK
bumping and this includes an SDK
bumping and this includes an SDK
client so that users can quickly send
client so that users can quickly send
client so that users can quickly send
transactions or pain painlessly and I'll
transactions or pain painlessly and I'll
transactions or pain painlessly and I'll
give a demo of that at the end of this
give a demo of that at the end of this
give a demo of that at the end of this
anyway but just to walk through the the
anyway but just to walk through the the
anyway but just to walk through the the
flow of of what happens here. So from
flow of of what happens here. So from
flow of of what happens here. So from
the client the user will send a request.
the client the user will send a request.
the client the user will send a request.
The request goes to the relayer and the
The request goes to the relayer and the
The request goes to the relayer and the
reer invokes the plug-in. The plugin
reer invokes the plug-in. The plugin
reer invokes the plug-in. The plugin
then acquires a channel account. This
then acquires a channel account. This
then acquires a channel account. This
channel account is managed by the realer
channel account is managed by the realer
channel account is managed by the realer
that I must say all of these accounts
that I must say all of these accounts
that I must say all of these accounts
are managed by the realer but the
are managed by the realer but the
are managed by the realer but the
plug-in is able to lock one and then
plug-in is able to lock one and then
plug-in is able to lock one and then
sign a transaction with that channel
sign a transaction with that channel
sign a transaction with that channel
account. And that transaction is the one
account. And that transaction is the one
account. And that transaction is the one
that the user sent. And we then wrap
that the user sent. And we then wrap
that the user sent. And we then wrap
that in a fee bump and submit it to the
that in a fee bump and submit it to the
that in a fee bump and submit it to the
Stellar network. Once the transaction
Stellar network. Once the transaction
Stellar network. Once the transaction
confirms, we release the lock and we
confirms, we release the lock and we
confirms, we release the lock and we
send the result back to the user. So the
send the result back to the user. So the
send the result back to the user. So the
the system is is scalable by the number
the system is is scalable by the number
the system is is scalable by the number
of channel accounts that we have to
of channel accounts that we have to
of channel accounts that we have to
offer. So if we if we if we put 200
offer. So if we if we if we put 200
offer. So if we if we if we put 200
channel accounts in the system, you can
channel accounts in the system, you can
channel accounts in the system, you can
send 200 transactions in parallel with
send 200 transactions in parallel with
send 200 transactions in parallel with
with one user account. and just
with one user account. and just
with one user account. and just
quickly on the on the account pooling
quickly on the on the account pooling
quickly on the on the account pooling
system we have here. So the plug-in
system we have here. So the plug-in
system we have here. So the plug-in
system behind the scenes is using Reddus
system behind the scenes is using Reddus
system behind the scenes is using Reddus
to manage the the pool of accounts. So
to manage the the pool of accounts. So
to manage the the pool of accounts. So
an incoming request comes in, we try to
an incoming request comes in, we try to
an incoming request comes in, we try to
lock the account. If it's available, we
lock the account. If it's available, we
lock the account. If it's available, we
can acquire it, process transaction. If
can acquire it, process transaction. If
can acquire it, process transaction. If
it's not, we try again on the next
it's not, we try again on the next
it's not, we try again on the next
account. So it's it's it's it's
account. So it's it's it's it's
account. So it's it's it's it's
pretty straightforward. and just
pretty straightforward. and just
pretty straightforward. and just
quickly on
quickly on
quickly on
the SD SDK client itself. So this is
the SD SDK client itself. So this is
the SD SDK client itself. So this is
what it would look like for sending
what it would look like for sending
what it would look like for sending
transaction. so we have this channels
transaction. so we have this channels
transaction. so we have this channels
client and right now the the base URL is
client and right now the the base URL is
client and right now the the base URL is
pointing at channels.openzeppland.com
pointing at channels.openzeppland.com
pointing at channels.openzeppland.com
which isn't live yet. We're still
which isn't live yet. We're still
which isn't live yet. We're still
working on getting that live either
working on getting that live either
working on getting that live either
tomorrow or by Monday. But this could
tomorrow or by Monday. But this could
tomorrow or by Monday. But this could
also be you can also send this these
also be you can also send this these

requests to your own self-hosted relay.
Right? So this doesn't have to go
Right? So this doesn't have to go
Right? So this doesn't have to go
through the through the managed service
through the through the managed service
through the through the managed service
that we provide. So this plug-in is all
that we provide. So this plug-in is all
that we provide. So this plug-in is all
open source. The open reception relay is
open source. The open reception relay is
open source. The open reception relay is
open source. So anyone can just spin
open source. So anyone can just spin
open source. So anyone can just spin
up their own instance and manage their
up their own instance and manage their
up their own instance and manage their
own channel accounts. But we will be
own channel accounts. But we will be
own channel accounts. But we will be
offering this as a service and man
offering this as a service and man
offering this as a service and man
managing it all for you as well. So
managing it all for you as well. So
managing it all for you as well. So
it's quite simple. set up the client
it's quite simple. set up the client
it's quite simple. set up the client
and to submit a transaction you in this
and to submit a transaction you in this
and to submit a transaction you in this
case we're submitting a sorbent
case we're submitting a sorbent
case we're submitting a sorbent
transaction so you just provide the the
transaction so you just provide the the
transaction so you just provide the the
function XDR and the attached XDR and an

example of the response would be like so
example of the response would be like so
example of the response would be like so
so this is the transaction ID for the
so this is the transaction ID for the
so this is the transaction ID for the
relayer and the hash for the

so in the case of someone who is running
so in the case of someone who is running
so in the case of someone who is running
a self-hosted version they would want to
a self-hosted version they would want to
a self-hosted version they would want to
manage the channel accounts. So there
manage the channel accounts. So there
manage the channel accounts. So there
is some methods in the SDK that will
is some methods in the SDK that will
is some methods in the SDK that will
allow you to list what channel accounts
allow you to list what channel accounts
allow you to list what channel accounts
are available on the service and also
are available on the service and also
are available on the service and also
add new ones. So if you needed to
add new ones. So if you needed to
add new ones. So if you needed to
increase the throughput you could you
increase the throughput you could you
increase the throughput you could you
could add more channel accounts or if
could add more channel accounts or if
could add more channel accounts or if
there's some issue you can remove
there's some issue you can remove
there's some issue you can remove
some etc. so yeah in a nutshell all
some etc. so yeah in a nutshell all

of these things have come together and
of these things have come together and
of these things have come together and
we're offering a Stellar relays
we're offering a Stellar relays
we're offering a Stellar relays

the function in a to the client itself.
So
So
So
just want to point out first though that
just want to point out first though that
just want to point out first though that
in order to use the service you need to
in order to use the service you need to
in order to use the service you need to
get a API key. So you can just call
get a API key. So you can just call
get a API key. So you can just call
the domain channels.open.com/gen
the domain channels.open.com/gen
the domain channels.open.com/gen
to get an API key.
to get an API key.
to get an API key.
And for the sake of this
And for the sake of this
And for the sake of this
demo, I'm just going to
demo, I'm just going to
demo, I'm just going to
add the API key here
add the API key here
add the API key here
and call the demo script.
and call the demo script.
and call the demo script.
So this is going through the staging
So this is going through the staging
So this is going through the staging
environment that we have for the managed
environment that we have for the managed
environment that we have for the managed
service right now.
Okay. So the transaction is confirmed.
Okay. So the transaction is confirmed.
just to
just to
just to
double check that
double check that
double check that
yeah transaction was successful. And
yeah transaction was successful. And
yeah transaction was successful. And
just to demonstrate the the parallel
just to demonstrate the the parallel
just to demonstrate the the parallel
processing of this I also have a
processing of this I also have a
processing of this I also have a
parallel demo.
So, this is sending 10 transactions
So, this is sending 10 transactions
at the same time with the exact same
at the same time with the exact same
at the same time with the exact same

 Great. So, I'm I'm a little bit curious
 Great. So, I'm I'm a little bit curious
 Great. So, I'm I'm a little bit curious
about the the managed service
about the the managed service
about the the managed service
because it seems like of course

depending on your use case that
depending on your use case that
depending on your use case that
especially for maybe testing it out, it

it it seems like a lot more convenient
it it seems like a lot more convenient
it it seems like a lot more convenient
to just try it out with the with the
to just try it out with the with the

How do I get set up with that?
So we are finalizing the the
So we are finalizing the the
So we are finalizing the the
documentation and the the SDK
