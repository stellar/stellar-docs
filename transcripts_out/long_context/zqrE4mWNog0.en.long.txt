I'm working with OP Zeppelin for about one and a half years and my one and a half years and my. one and a half years and my background is more on the the high background is more on the the high. Background is more on the the high performance Computing distributed performance Computing distributed. Performance Computing distributed systems and cryptography all of these systems and cryptography all of these. Systems and cryptography all of these included I started my blockchain journey included I started my blockchain journey. Included I started my blockchain journey in some startups for layer zero or layer. In some startups for layer zero or layer in some startups for layer zero or layer. One if you will and then transitioned one if you will and then transitioned one if you will and then transitioned. More into po do ecosystem and now I'm more into po do ecosystem and now I'm . More into po do ecosystem and now I'm switched to Stell and quite happy with switched to Stell and quite happy with. Switched to Stell and quite happy with it great great thank you and welcome to it great great thank you and welcome to. It great great thank you and welcome to you too yeah we started this journey a you too yeah we started this journey a. You too yeah we started this journey a while ago and the the reason is or the while ago and the the reason is or the. While ago and the the reason is or the objective is to make it easier to for objective is to make it easier to for. Objective is to make it easier to for for new developers to to onboard Stellar for new developers to to onboard Stellar. For new developers to to onboard Stellar and to to build to build great Solutions. And to to build to build great Solutions and to to build to build great Solutions. so where are we now how how far have so where are we now how how far have so where are we now how how far have. We come in implementing Stellar in in we come in implementing Stellar in in. We come in implementing Stellar in in open sppin can you just give a really open sppin can you just give a really. Open sppin can you just give a really quick overview of where we are and quick overview of where we are and. Quick overview of where we are and what's being worked on if you want to go you can go yeah. On if you want to go you can go yeah sure yeah so yeah it's been couple sure yeah so yeah it's been couple. Sure yeah so yeah it's been couple couple months that we we kicked it couple months that we we kicked it. Couple months that we we kicked it off we are already on our like off we are already on our like. Off we are already on our like approaching our second audit meaning approaching our second audit meaning. Approaching our second audit meaning that we are we accomplished our second that we are we accomplished our second. That we are we accomplished our second milestone and the idea is that we we milestone and the idea is that we we. Milestone and the idea is that we we got our work audited on a regular got our work audited on a regular. got our work audited on a regular basis so the the the products the the basis so the the the products the the. Basis so the the the products the the tools we are delivering to tools we are delivering to. Tools we are delivering to Stellar ecosystem are safe and secure Stellar ecosystem are safe and secure. Stellar ecosystem are safe and secure and yeah so so at the moment and yeah so so at the moment. And yeah so so at the moment like we last month for E Denver we like we last month for E Denver we. Like we last month for E Denver we we shipped our first first we shipped our first first. we shipped our first first first first first release that was about fible. Release that was about fible release that was about fible tokens and the PO. Tokens and the PO tokens and the PO utility now we are heading to utility now we are heading to . Utility now we are heading to delivering the non delivering the non delivering the non. Funable Implement non fible token funable Implement non fible token funable Implement non fible token. Tokens tokens tokens implementation implementation implementation packed with couple of extensions so. packed with couple of extensions so packed with couple of extensions so that that suits different use cases. That that suits different use cases that that suits different use cases so and yeah next week we are kicking. So and yeah next week we are kicking so and yeah next week we are kicking off the the second audit that will . Off the the second audit that will off the the second audit that will that will last for another week and and. That will last for another week and and that will last for another week and and then we are shipping the we are. then we are shipping the we are then we are shipping the we are releasing the next yeah the next. Releasing the next yeah the next releasing the next yeah the next release okay great this is where we are. Release okay great this is where we are release okay great this is where we are great so for for those who may not have. Great so for for those who may not have great so for for those who may not have followed the the openin initiative or. followed the the openin initiative or followed the the openin initiative or. Have just curious what what's what what have just curious what what's what what have just curious what what's what what. We we're doing here can you maybe we we're doing here can you maybe we we're doing here can you maybe. Share maybe share the screen just show share maybe share the screen just show share maybe share the screen just show. An example of what what an example of what what an example of what what the what it looks like like the maybe. The what it looks like like the maybe the what it looks like like the maybe the wizard just really quick give an. The wizard just really quick give an the wizard just really quick give an introduction to like what is it the. Introduction to like what is it the introduction to like what is it the developers are experiencing and what is. Developers are experiencing and what is developers are experiencing and what is it the developers can do right. Now yeah sure I can I can now yeah sure I can I can showcase the wizard The Open. Showcase the wizard The Open showcase the wizard The Open Zepp Wizard and how it makes super easy. Zepp Wizard and how it makes super easy Zepp Wizard and how it makes super easy for developers to. For developers to for developers to to have like a base basic smart contract to have like a base basic smart contract. To have like a base basic smart contract at some at some at some . Custom functionalities if they're custom functionalities if they're custom functionalities if they're. Needed and deployed to to testet needed and deployed to to testet needed and deployed to to testet . Yeah I would love to to do that yeah I would love to to do that yeah I would love to to do that. Yeah I think that would be a great yeah I think that would be a great yeah I think that would be a great. Introduction to to open sa for for new introduction to to open sa for for new introduction to to open sa for for new. For new develop yeah sure so let me for new develop yeah sure so let me for new develop yeah sure so let me. Share my screen screen I think it's loading yeah okay so screen I think it's loading yeah okay so. Here it is the the the Wizard so it's here it is the the the Wizard so it's . Here it is the the the Wizard so it's wizard. Open.com I believe it may be helpful open.com I believe it may be helpful to zoom in just one or two more bits to. To zoom in just one or two more bits to to zoom in just one or two more bits to make it more. Readable okay this is this time I think readable okay this is this time I think good what what do you. Good what what do you good what what do you think yeah it's it's I think I think yeah it's it's I think I. Think yeah it's it's I think I think we can we can read it now yeah it think we can we can read it now yeah it. Think we can we can read it now yeah it looks looks looks good okay so yeah this is our wizard. Good okay so yeah this is our wizard good okay so yeah this is our wizard which the idea of it is like to to. which the idea of it is like to to which the idea of it is like to to make life easier if you need to . Make life easier if you need to make life easier if you need to like to to build up something quickly. Like to to build up something quickly like to to build up something quickly. so some with some base some so some with some base some so some with some base some. Basic features you can use it yeah basic features you can use it yeah. Basic features you can use it yeah you can see we have for different you can see we have for different. You can see we have for different languages and U languages and U languages and U. Chains chains chains so here at that's Stellar for the so here at that's Stellar for the. so here at that's Stellar for the moment we have only fungible but as we moment we have only fungible but as we. Moment we have only fungible but as we fin once we finish the non fungible fin once we finish the non fungible . Fin once we finish the non fungible module and get get it audited it module and get get it audited it. module and get get it audited it will be added here similar to so you can will be added here similar to so you can. Will be added here similar to so you can see at for solidity there are see at for solidity there are. See at for solidity there are different modules for the moment here different modules for the moment here. Different modules for the moment here we have only F and thanks to this UI we have only F and thanks to this UI. We have only F and thanks to this UI you can configure the Bas the basic you can configure the Bas the basic. You can configure the Bas the basic properties of your Tok for example let's properties of your Tok for example let's. Properties of your Tok for example let's call call it call call it call call it awesome awesome. Awesome awesome awesome awesome token it's yeah really basic so token it's yeah really basic so. Token it's yeah really basic so and here we can Define for example if we. And here we can Define for example if we and here we can Define for example if we. Want to do some Prem Min let's say we want to do some Prem Min let's say we. Want to do some Prem Min let's say we want to to Mint 1,000 of bit of this want to to Mint 1,000 of bit of this. Want to to Mint 1,000 of bit of this token and here there are different Fe token and here there are different Fe. Token and here there are different Fe Fe that we can add on top of this basic Fe that we can add on top of this basic. Fe that we can add on top of this basic implementation for example say we want implementation for example say we want. Implementation for example say we want it to be minable and you see how the it to be minable and you see how the. It to be minable and you see how the UI gets updated if you want to to add a UI gets updated if you want to to add a. UI gets updated if you want to to add a burnable functionality meaning to allow burnable functionality meaning to allow. Burnable functionality meaning to allow users to burn their tokens they wish so users to burn their tokens they wish so. Users to burn their tokens they wish so we can click on that and yeah this is we can click on that and yeah this is. We can click on that and yeah this is how our contract looks how our contract looks. How our contract looks like then let's deploy it to to like then let's deploy it to to. Like then let's deploy it to to test test test net so we are going to set up a. Net so we are going to set up a net so we are going to set up a. Project with the with the Stell project with the with the Stell project with the with the Stell. CLI so yeah for those who yeah yeah we can check basically we can yeah we can check basically we can. Check at Stellar documentation how to to check at Stellar documentation how to to. Check at Stellar documentation how to to install the CLI and and use it but. Install the CLI and and use it but install the CLI and and use it but. Yeah here we're initializing the the yeah here we're initializing the the yeah here we're initializing the the. Project so here we have we have our project so here we have we have our project so here we have we have our. Awesome token awesome token awesome token contract yeah we we need to. Contract yeah we we need to contract yeah we we need to add we need to add the the. Add we need to add the the add we need to add the the dependency here the recommendation is. Dependency here the recommendation is dependency here the recommendation is. To use to pin it to a specific version to use to pin it to a specific version to use to pin it to a specific version. Or or or tag so as the this version 0. one tag so as the this version 0. one . Tag so as the this version 0. one is the the most recently audited it's is the the most recently audited it's . Is the the most recently audited it's this version that we are going to use this version that we are going to use. This version that we are going to use then we are ready then we are ready then we are ready. To like to delete this boiler plate that to like to delete this boiler plate that. To like to delete this boiler plate that was provided by the C and go back to was provided by the C and go back to . Was provided by the C and go back to the wizard UI here the wizard UI here the wizard UI here. We are copying our we are copying our we are copying our contract going back to the file we are. Contract going back to the file we are contract going back to the file we are pasting pasting. Pasting pasting pasting pasting it and yeah so we have it we have it and yeah so we have it we have. It and yeah so we have it we have everything set up if we like if we everything set up if we like if we. Everything set up if we like if we need to do some need to do some need to do some. Modifications we we can we and we modifications we we can we and we modifications we we can we and we. Know of course what what we are doing we know of course what what we are doing we. Know of course what what we are doing we can go and straight to the can go and straight to the. Can go and straight to the to the codent modified then to the codent modified then. To the codent modified then we are going to to build we are going to to build. we are going to to build this to build this contract so it is this to build this contract so it is. This to build this contract so it is done then the recommendations are to done then the recommendations are to. Done then the recommendations are to also not only build but also also not only build but also. Also not only build but also to optimize it to optimize it to optimize it. so there is a special yeah there is a CLI there is a special yeah there is a CLI. Command for it so well it's not so here it is we we gained like so here it is we we gained like. Something like 1,000 and something bytes something like 1,000 and something bytes. Something like 1,000 and something bytes of our optimized version so it is ready of our optimized version so it is ready. Of our optimized version so it is ready to be deployed to be deployed to be deployed. Now just for the record I have like I now just for the record I have like I. Now just for the record I have like I set it up wallet from the Stellar set it up wallet from the Stellar. Set it up wallet from the Stellar lab and funded it with some with some lab and funded it with some with some. Lab and funded it with some with some lumens test net lumens and now we are. Lumens test net lumens and now we are lumens test net lumens and now we are. Going to deploy to deploy it so it was called my it so it was called my awesome my awesome token. Awesome my awesome token awesome my awesome token right we are deploying it with the. Right we are deploying it with the right we are deploying it with the Alice with the Alice . Alice with the Alice Alice with the Alice key yeah here is U an address that. Key yeah here is U an address that key yeah here is U an address that will be the owner and . Will be the owner and will be the owner and the the recipient let's let's say it will be Alice again. Let's let's say it will be Alice again so Alice will re receive the the the so Alice will re receive the the the. So Alice will re receive the the the tokens so if everything's tokens so if everything's. Tokens so if everything's    fine we should have our contract. Fine we should have our contract fine we should have our contract  .  so yeah this is fine it gets it got so yeah this is fine it gets it got. So yeah this is fine it gets it got deployed this at this deployed this at this. Deployed this at this address and Alice received the 1,000 address and Alice received the 1,000. Address and Alice received the 1,000 1,000 tokens that we we 1,000 tokens that we we. 1,000 tokens that we we yeah we we preed basically and now yeah we we preed basically and now. yeah we we preed basically and now yeah you can interact with this yeah you can interact with this . Yeah you can interact with this contract either with the CLI or build contract either with the CLI or build. Contract either with the CLI or build a UI build a UI for it maybe just a UI build a UI for it maybe just. A UI build a UI for it maybe just let you let demonstrate how we can let you let demonstrate how we can. Let you let demonstrate how we can invoke invoke invoke it so just to so this is the. so just to so this is the contract so yeah it actually it is contract so yeah it actually it is. Contract so yeah it actually it is stored under token the token Alas and we stored under token the token Alas and we. Stored under token the token Alas and we going to check we going to check the going to check we going to check the. Going to check we going to check the balance of Alice yeah okay so it's working we. Alice yeah okay so it's working we checked so the balance is correct checked so the balance is correct. Checked so the balance is correct because it's because it's because it's yeah how. yeah how yeah how the yeah basically we preed 1,000 with the yeah basically we preed 1,000 with. The yeah basically we preed 1,000 with 18 decimals so that's why we see so big 18 decimals so that's why we see so big. 18 decimals so that's why we see so big zero so so many zeros and yeah I zero so so many zeros and yeah I. Zero so so many zeros and yeah I guess this is guess this is guess this is. Enough this is great yeah this is great enough this is great yeah this is great enough this is great yeah this is great. It really it really I convince you it's really it really I convince you it's really easy I mean of course you have. Really easy I mean of course you have really easy I mean of course you have. To to to be familiar a bit with the Stellar CI be familiar a bit with the Stellar CI. Be familiar a bit with the Stellar CI but I think it's a great very intuitive but I think it's a great very intuitive. But I think it's a great very intuitive and user friendly so yeah it's really and user friendly so yeah it's really. And user friendly so yeah it's really easy to to get up to speed with with easy to to get up to speed with with. Easy to to get up to speed with with that so yeah yeah yeah I think this that so yeah yeah yeah I think this. That so yeah yeah yeah I think this this demo showed really how how this demo showed really how how. This demo showed really how how simple it is to to to work with and one simple it is to to to work with and one. Simple it is to to to work with and one thing that I that I appreciate a lot too thing that I that I appreciate a lot too. Thing that I that I appreciate a lot too is the testing that this goes through on. Is the testing that this goes through on is the testing that this goes through on. Your end so if if you are implementing your end so if if you are implementing your end so if if you are implementing. This yourself and maybe you you are this yourself and maybe you you are this yourself and maybe you you are. Still pretty new to development on on still pretty new to development on on. Still pretty new to development on on on Stellar I think just knowing that on Stellar I think just knowing that. On Stellar I think just knowing that this has been tested thoroughly this is this has been tested thoroughly this is. This has been tested thoroughly this is secure this is safe I think that that secure this is safe I think that that. Secure this is safe I think that that gives me a lot more confidence as a gives me a lot more confidence as a. Gives me a lot more confidence as a developer that the products I'm building developer that the products I'm building. Developer that the products I'm building that they are also safe for for the that they are also safe for for the. that they are also safe for for the users so I think that's that's something users so I think that's that's something. Users so I think that's that's something that you know the convenience of of that you know the convenience of of. That you know the convenience of of using open sein is is is obvious here using open sein is is is obvious here. Using open sein is is is obvious here it's super easy and simple but I think I it's super easy and simple but I think I. It's super easy and simple but I think I think for me the knowing that that I think for me the knowing that that. I think for me the knowing that that this has actually gone through very this has actually gone through very. This has actually gone through very serious testing that that that's serious testing that that that's. Serious testing that that that's something that I would like to at least something that I would like to at least. Something that I would like to at least put a little bit of Spotlight on I put a little bit of Spotlight on I. Put a little bit of Spotlight on I think maybe we can see if there's think maybe we can see if there's. Think maybe we can see if there's anyone that has any questions let me anyone that has any questions let me. Anyone that has any questions let me see I see Elliot actually one of my team see I see Elliot actually one of my team. See I see Elliot actually one of my team members he has a question here he members he has a question here he. Members he has a question here he says in the nft contracts are you says in the nft contracts are you. Says in the nft contracts are you implementing the same extensions as the implementing the same extensions as the. Implementing the same extensions as the F tokens or is a different set of F tokens or is a different set of. F tokens or is a different set of extensions I believe I can take this one extensions I believe I can take this one. Extensions I believe I can take this one so they are not completely the same so they are not completely the same. so they are not completely the same since the standards We are following since the standards We are following. Since the standards We are following are getting differentiated as well so are getting differentiated as well so. Are getting differentiated as well so for nfts it would be enumerable for nfts it would be enumerable. For nfts it would be enumerable consecutive minable consecutive minable consecutive minable. Burnable and also burnable and also burnable and also claimable but some of these are not. Claimable but some of these are not claimable but some of these are not exactly exactly. Exactly extensions but we want to give the extensions but we want to give the. Extensions but we want to give the name of them so that if a person from name of them so that if a person from. Name of them so that if a person from other ecosystems comes here and wants to other ecosystems comes here and wants to. Other ecosystems comes here and wants to search for these they will know how they. Search for these they will know how they search for these they will know how they. Are implemented or adopted into Stellar are implemented or adopted into Stellar are implemented or adopted into Stellar. So these five things that I mentioned so these five things that I mentioned so these five things that I mentioned. Will be will be will be covered okay great we have another covered okay great we have another. Covered okay great we have another question from JS maxi it says said question from JS maxi it says said. Question from JS maxi it says said we we we are sentential developing an R ERC. Are sentential developing an R ERC are sentential developing an R ERC 4626 standard Vault Solution on Stell. 4626 standard Vault Solution on Stell 4626 standard Vault Solution on Stell San and if that could be integrated into. San and if that could be integrated into San and if that could be integrated into. Open sain standard library for soran in open sain standard library for soran in open sain standard library for soran in. The future I don't actually don't the future I don't actually don't the future I don't actually don't. Know if that's something we can we can know if that's something we can we can know if that's something we can we can. Answer here I think that's answer here I think that's answer here I think that's . Probably is about 46 probably is about 46 probably is about 46 36 yeah 36 yeah 36 yeah. 46 26 yeah yeah yeah yeah it is it is 46 26 yeah yeah yeah yeah it is it is . 46 26 yeah yeah yeah yeah it is it is it is included in the road map down the it is included in the road map down the. It is included in the road map down the yeah for the next Milestones I'm not yeah for the next Milestones I'm not. Yeah for the next Milestones I'm not sure if in the in the Milestone 2 or sure if in the in the Milestone 2 or. Sure if in the in the Milestone 2 or Milestone three but it is for sure Milestone three but it is for sure. Milestone three but it is for sure included in in the road map okay but the included in in the road map okay but the. Included in in the road map okay but the question is they are asking for question is they are asking for. Question is they are asking for collaboration so they are already trying collaboration so they are already trying. Collaboration so they are already trying to build it so yes by the way yes we are. To build it so yes by the way yes we are to build it so yes by the way yes we are. the title of our jobs is open source the title of our jobs is open source the title of our jobs is open source. So of course any collaboration is more so of course any collaboration is more so of course any collaboration is more.

This is this is why it's great to have you guys on here because I was not able you guys on here because I was not able. You guys on here because I was not able to answer that question you you guys are to answer that question you you guys are. To answer that question you you guys are the experts on that okay let's see we. The experts on that okay let's see we the experts on that okay let's see we. Have one question more from Matias have one question more from Matias have one question more from Matias . What design considerations were made for what design considerations were made for. What design considerations were made for the library considering classic Soroban the library considering classic Soroban. The library considering classic Soroban and How Stellar classic assets work yeah I can I can maybe maybe. Work yeah I can I can maybe maybe partially give an answer and O you're partially give an answer and O you're. Partially give an answer and O you're going to to to add if I miss anything going to to to add if I miss anything. Going to to to add if I miss anything yeah so we are trying to yeah so we are trying to. yeah so we are trying to navigate between like different navigate between like different . navigate between like different let's say requirements concerns . Let's say requirements concerns let's say requirements concerns . And yeah of course and yeah of course and yeah of course one of the requirements is to to. one of the requirements is to to one of the requirements is to to make things compatible with Stellar. Make things compatible with Stellar make things compatible with Stellar classic for the moment we have. Classic for the moment we have classic for the moment we have finished with with the fungible . Finished with with the fungible finished with with the fungible fungible token implementation that is. Fungible token implementation that is fungible token implementation that is like in the that was audited I. Like in the that was audited I like in the that was audited I demonstrated and actually it overlaps. Demonstrated and actually it overlaps demonstrated and actually it overlaps. By with many of the features that are by with many of the features that are. By with many of the features that are available already from the Soroban available already from the Soroban . Available already from the Soroban sbone SDK itself so on that on that sbone SDK itself so on that on that. Sbone SDK itself so on that on that front we haven't done much because yeah front we haven't done much because yeah. Front we haven't done much because yeah most of the work was already done by the most of the work was already done by the. Most of the work was already done by the the Stellar development foundation the Stellar development foundation. The Stellar development foundation team so team so team so yeah for the nft that we are for the. yeah for the nft that we are for the yeah for the nft that we are for the nft part modu that we are working at. Nft part modu that we are working at nft part modu that we are working at right now yeah there there are some. Right now yeah there there are some right now yeah there there are some there are some discussions about. There are some discussions about there are some discussions about how how this compatibility can be . How how this compatibility can be how how this compatibility can be brought on the. Brought on the brought on the table there are some ideas that are table there are some ideas that are. Table there are some ideas that are circulating but yeah trying to to circulating but yeah trying to to. Circulating but yeah trying to to accommodate also for existing Stellar accommodate also for existing Stellar . Accommodate also for existing Stellar developers that are like try to leverage. Developers that are like try to leverage developers that are like try to leverage. Stellar classic assets but also for Stellar classic assets but also for Stellar classic assets but also for.

Can be brought only by smart can be brought only by smart can be brought only by smart. Contracts okay contracts okay contracts okay great let's see yeah and I was actually. Great let's see yeah and I was actually great let's see yeah and I was actually thinking about this mat was he was. Thinking about this mat was he was thinking about this mat was he was asking on what's on. Asking on what's on asking on what's on what's on the the road map what what what's on the the road map what what. what's on the the road map what what is coming next can you maybe talk a is coming next can you maybe talk a. Is coming next can you maybe talk a little bit about the road little bit about the road. Little bit about the road map there will be smart wallets many map there will be smart wallets many. Map there will be smart wallets many other token other token other token standards some utilities like fix. Standards some utilities like fix standards some utilities like fix Point arithmetic and Merle proofs stuff. Point arithmetic and Merle proofs stuff Point arithmetic and Merle proofs stuff like that but they are. Like that but they are like that but they are all discussed and we may change the. All discussed and we may change the all discussed and we may change the order Etc depending on the community. Order Etc depending on the community order Etc depending on the community feedback and our. Feedback and our feedback and our priorities okay great yeah actually yeah priorities okay great yeah actually yeah. Priorities okay great yeah actually yeah actually yeah we are really looking for actually yeah we are really looking for. Actually yeah we are really looking for like feedback what is what are the like feedback what is what are the. Like feedback what is what are the utilities the The Primitives that are utilities the The Primitives that are. Utilities the The Primitives that are most the mostly like Builders from most the mostly like Builders from. Most the mostly like Builders from Stellar are like eager to see so yeah Stellar are like eager to see so yeah. Stellar are like eager to see so yeah we are definitely looking for for we are definitely looking for for. We are definitely looking for for feedback so that we can Shape Up feedback so that we can Shape Up. Feedback so that we can Shape Up together the our road together the our road. Together the our road map okay great so we have a question map okay great so we have a question. Map okay great so we have a question also from L again any highlights or also from L again any highlights or. Also from L again any highlights or low lights you can share about the low lights you can share about the. Low lights you can share about the Stellar sorond architecture compared to Stellar sorond architecture compared to. Stellar sorond architecture compared to other blockchains since you have work other blockchains since you have work. Other blockchains since you have work with other chains you want me to start buan and. Chains you want me to start buan and then you can continue okay so then you can continue okay so. Then you can continue okay so authorization is done in a great way I authorization is done in a great way I. Authorization is done in a great way I will let poan speak more on that but but will let poan speak more on that but but. Will let poan speak more on that but but I also admire the way authorization I also admire the way authorization. I also admire the way authorization and authentication Works in and authentication Works in. And authentication Works in San my San my San my biggest admiration comes from the. Biggest admiration comes from the biggest admiration comes from the developer experience it's great right. Developer experience it's great right developer experience it's great right now it's super simple yet super safe, and now it's super simple yet super safe and now it's super simple yet super safe and. We also want to and try to do our best we also want to and try to do our best we also want to and try to do our best. To keep this safety and simplicity in to keep this safety and simplicity in to keep this safety and simplicity in. Our yeah I'm yeah I'm also joining Al on on this on this also joining Al on on this on this. Also joining Al on on this on this front and yeah just to add that . front and yeah just to add that front and yeah just to add that . Like yeah authorizations like yeah authorizations like yeah authorizations . How how they're handled like on how how they're handled like on. How how they're handled like on a protocol level actually relieves . A protocol level actually relieves a protocol level actually relieves . A lot of lot of remove a lot of pain a lot of lot of remove a lot of pain a lot of lot of remove a lot of pain. Points that for example developers from points that for example developers from points that for example developers from. Coming from evm chains are having like coming from evm chains are having like coming from evm chains are having like. For dealing with for dealing with for dealing with authorizations actually many of the. Authorizations actually many of the authorizations actually many of the things that are natively supported . Things that are natively supported things that are natively supported and Builders shouldn't care like at all. And Builders shouldn't care like at all and Builders shouldn't care like at all in other ecosystems like it's additional. In other ecosystems like it's additional in other ecosystems like it's additional. Overhead of like how to construct your overhead of like how to construct your overhead of like how to construct your. contract so they're not too big contract so they're not too big contract so they're not too big. They're too complex and here like they're too complex and here like they're too complex and here like. Builders can focus on what's the most Builders can focus on what's the most Builders can focus on what's the most. Important the business logic that is important the business logic that is important the business logic that is . That is regarding their their that is regarding their their that is regarding their their. Specific application so this is a huge a specific application so this is a huge a. Specific application so this is a huge a huge benefit other thing that comes huge benefit other thing that comes. Huge benefit other thing that comes to my mind is for example how how to my mind is for example how how . To my mind is for example how how the how we deal with the how we deal with. The how we deal with upgradability in in soron upgradability in in soron. Upgradability in in soron it's just a seamless like it's just a seamless like. It's just a seamless like a a wine liner compared to compared a a wine liner compared to compared. A a wine liner compared to compared to for example ethereum where are to for example ethereum where are. To for example ethereum where are like dozens of different OB like dozens of different OB. Like dozens of different OB gradability patterns with different gradability patterns with different. Gradability patterns with different tradeoffs security concerns Etc and tradeoffs security concerns Etc and. Tradeoffs security concerns Etc and here is just a no-brainer so it's bit a here is just a no-brainer so it's bit a. Here is just a no-brainer so it's bit a big thumbs up about the work that big thumbs up about the work that. Big thumbs up about the work that that's done that's done that's done . In the background so yeah okay great in the background so yeah okay great in the background so yeah okay great. Well that was all very positive so happy well that was all very positive so happy. Well that was all very positive so happy to hear that I think Matias was to hear that I think Matias was. To hear that I think Matias was asking about the soulbound tokens if if asking about the soulbound tokens if if. Asking about the soulbound tokens if if that's possible is that something that's possible is that something. That's possible is that something that's been cons being considered or that's been cons being considered or. That's been cons being considered or thought about or is that not something thought about or is that not something. Thought about or is that not something that's been been considered yet sorry it cut and I couldn't hear. Yet sorry it cut and I couldn't hear oh so Matas was asking about Soul oh so Matas was asking about Soul. Oh so Matas was asking about Soul bound tokens if that's soul to bound tokens if that's soul to. Bound tokens if that's soul to yeah actually it is not something yeah actually it is not something. Yeah actually it is not something that is planned straight straight that is planned straight straight. That is planned straight straight away but away but away but but yeah I mean with the nfts we are. but yeah I mean with the nfts we are but yeah I mean with the nfts we are building the the the the ground for for. Building the the the the ground for for building the the the the ground for for for that and yeah maybe yeah we have. For that and yeah maybe yeah we have for that and yeah maybe yeah we have to to see how yeah how this is how. To to see how yeah how this is how to to see how yeah how this is how. This can fit in the future Milestone this can fit in the future Milestone this can fit in the future Milestone.

Will for sure do will for sure do will for sure do it it it great have you great have you. Great have you identified the biggest pain points identified the biggest pain points. Identified the biggest pain points from a developer experience for building from a developer experience for building. From a developer experience for building cross Chain cross Chain cross Chain Solutions this also a question from. Yes right now we haven't explored how we yes right now we haven't explored how we. Would do cross chain stuff for Stellar would do cross chain stuff for Stellar would do cross chain stuff for Stellar. So I for myself am not able to answer so I for myself am not able to answer so I for myself am not able to answer.
