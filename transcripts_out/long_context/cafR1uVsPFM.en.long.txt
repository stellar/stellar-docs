We're going to talk about a We're going to talk about a a protocol upgrade that we're pushing. a protocol upgrade that we're pushing a protocol upgrade that we're pushing. For next week that is around for next week that is around for next week that is around . Fixing a bug that was discovered last fixing a bug that was discovered last fixing a bug that was discovered last. Week. So last month we pushed out week. So last month we pushed out week. So last month we pushed out. Whisk which is protocol 23 protocol whisk which is protocol 23 protocol whisk which is protocol 23 protocol . Was upgraded by a vote from tier one was upgraded by a vote from tier one was upgraded by a vote from tier one. Validators. and on Thursday last validators. and on Thursday last validators. and on Thursday last. Week, a week ago, we discovered a bug week, a week ago, we discovered a bug. Week, a week ago, we discovered a bug in the protocol. we've we worked in the protocol. we've we worked. In the protocol. we've we worked the following two days on containing the the following two days on containing the. The following two days on containing the bug. which affected state bug. which affected state. Bug. which affected state archival. so basically some small archival. so basically some small. Archival. so basically some small number of ledger entries that were number of ledger entries that were. Number of ledger entries that were archived were archived with the wrong archived were archived with the wrong . Archived were archived with the wrong version. So the not most recent version version. So the not most recent version. Version. So the not most recent version and when they were restored the and when they were restored the. and when they were restored the restoration allowed for the non-most restoration allowed for the non-most. Restoration allowed for the non-most recent version to be restored. the recent version to be restored. the. Recent version to be restored. the total number that was actually total number that was actually . Total number that was actually affected is less than 500 ledger affected is less than 500 ledger. Affected is less than 500 ledger entries. 478 to be exact. out of entries. 478 to be exact. out of. Entries. 478 to be exact. out of these only 84 were restored. so these only 84 were restored. so. These only 84 were restored. so these are ledger entries that were these are ledger entries that were. These are ledger entries that were actually restored to the Navos recent actually restored to the Navos recent. Actually restored to the Navos recent value. last week, Thursday, Friday, value. last week, Thursday, Friday,. Value. last week, Thursday, Friday, we worked with tier one validators to we worked with tier one validators to. We worked with tier one validators to contain this issue, which means that contain this issue, which means that. Contain this issue, which means that we've we've we've set out an emergency SLP to avoid. set out an emergency SLP to avoid set out an emergency SLP to avoid archiving more u more ledger entries. Archiving more u more ledger entries. Archiving more u more ledger entries. We also manually bumped all entries We also manually bumped all entries We also manually bumped all entries . On the network that were about to expire on the network that were about to expire. On the network that were about to expire so that they don't. So that they don't. So that they don't. we then issued a released a new we then issued a released a new. we then issued a released a new version of Stellar core that was patched. Version of Stellar core that was patched version of Stellar core that was patched. In order to ensure that the affected in order to ensure that the affected in order to ensure that the affected. Ledger entries cannot be touched so that ledger entries cannot be touched so that. Ledger entries cannot be touched so that any state inconsistencies remain any state inconsistencies remain. any state inconsistencies remain quarantined. Quarantined. Quarantined. that happened last week on Friday and that happened last week on Friday and. that happened last week on Friday and from that moment on we've been working from that moment on we've been working. From that moment on we've been working for the past week since Friday night for the past week since Friday night. For the past week since Friday night on on communicating with on on communicating with . On on communicating with validators and with affected protocols validators and with affected protocols. Validators and with affected protocols to understand what the extent of of to understand what the extent of of. To understand what the extent of of their issue was. we've also their issue was. we've also . Their issue was. we've also suggested a few protocol suggested a few protocol. Suggested a few protocol upgrade options in order to upgrade options in order to . upgrade options in order to rectify this. and the protocol option rectify this. and the protocol option. Rectify this. and the protocol option that is overwhelmingly the most that is overwhelmingly the most. that is overwhelmingly the most popular is the less intrusive one which popular is the less intrusive one which. Popular is the less intrusive one which is to obviously fix the bug to fix is to obviously fix the bug to fix. Is to obviously fix the bug to fix the archive. So all the ledger entries the archive. So all the ledger entries. The archive. So all the ledger entries that were archived and not restored will that were archived and not restored will. That were archived and not restored will be will be fixed in the archive and be will be fixed in the archive and. Be will be fixed in the archive and so when they're restored they will be so when they're restored they will be. So when they're restored they will be restored to the correct value. but restored to the correct value. but. Restored to the correct value. but with regards to the ledger entries that with regards to the ledger entries that. With regards to the ledger entries that are live and have been restored are live and have been restored. Are live and have been restored incorrectly we will not be addressing incorrectly we will not be addressing. Incorrectly we will not be addressing them on the protocol level but we them on the protocol level but we. Them on the protocol level but we have ensured with all affected have ensured with all affected . Have ensured with all affected issuers and protocols that we've been issuers and protocols that we've been. Issuers and protocols that we've been communicating with. we're talking about communicating with. we're talking about. Communicating with. we're talking about around 20 protocols. that they do around 20 protocols. that they do. Around 20 protocols. that they do have ways to rectify this on their have ways to rectify this on their. Have ways to rectify this on their end. so for some issuers, it just end. so for some issuers, it just. End. so for some issuers, it just means that they need to adjust the means that they need to adjust the. Means that they need to adjust the supply to make sure that it's it supply to make sure that it's it. Supply to make sure that it's it reflects what's on chain. a lot of reflects what's on chain. a lot of. Reflects what's on chain. a lot of the issues a lot of the state the issues a lot of the state . The issues a lot of the state changes have actually been benign and changes have actually been benign and. Changes have actually been benign and not had any meaningful impact. , and not had any meaningful impact. , and. Not had any meaningful impact. , and some protocols have had ways to , kind some protocols have had ways to , kind. Some protocols have had ways to , kind of like upgrade out of these issues. Of like upgrade out of these issues. Of like upgrade out of these issues. , and so I am going to stop talking , and so I am going to stop talking , and so I am going to stop talking. For a bit right now and , happy to , for a bit right now and , happy to ,. For a bit right now and , happy to , take any questions. Justin, did you guys. Take any questions. Justin, did you guys take any questions. Justin, did you guys. Hear all this? Hear all this? Hear all this?  , yes. It sounded great. And right now  , yes. It sounded great. And right now.  , yes. It sounded great. And right now I'm just going to paste the blog post. I'm just going to paste the blog post I'm just going to paste the blog post that we just released that explains. That we just released that explains that we just released that explains this a little bit in the chat over. This a little bit in the chat over this a little bit in the chat over here. So if you want to sort of read a. Here. So if you want to sort of read a here. So if you want to sort of read a version of what Tor said, it's there. . Version of what Tor said, it's there. version of what Tor said, it's there. . We also you'll see that there's a link we also you'll see that there's a link we also you'll see that there's a link. To a cap there. the cap is is the to a cap there. the cap is is the to a cap there. the cap is is the. Suggested change that Tor was talking suggested change that Tor was talking suggested change that Tor was talking. About and I think I think Nico is about and I think I think Nico is about and I think I think Nico is. Here and will join us on stage in a here and will join us on stage in a here and will join us on stage in a. Minute to talk through the cap. but minute to talk through the cap. but minute to talk through the cap. but. First there is a question from Jome. First there is a question from Jome. First there is a question from Jome. This was completely random. So some This was completely random. So some This was completely random. So some. Entries were correctly archived and entries were correctly archived and entries were correctly archived and. Restored. Restored. Restored.  it's not random in the sense that  it's not random in the sense that.  it's not random in the sense that this was not arbitrary. It was this was not arbitrary. It was. This was not arbitrary. It was deterministic in the sense that all deterministic in the sense that all. Deterministic in the sense that all protocols all validators actually protocols all validators actually. Protocols all validators actually behaved exactly the same. So the behaved exactly the same. So the. Behaved exactly the same. So the network did not fork based on this network did not fork based on this. Network did not fork based on this behavior. it was consistent. but behavior. it was consistent. but. Behavior. it was consistent. but it required a very kind of like it required a very kind of like. it required a very kind of like specific arbitrary chain of events that specific arbitrary chain of events that. Specific arbitrary chain of events that relate to how whisk handles live relate to how whisk handles live. Relate to how whisk handles live state prioritization between the state prioritization between the. State prioritization between the bucket list which includes all the live bucket list which includes all the live. Bucket list which includes all the live states and the evicted state. so states and the evicted state. so. States and the evicted state. so not random but definitely also not not random but definitely also not. Not random but definitely also not trivial to identify. Okay, it looks like it looks like there Okay, it looks like it looks like there are . I mean I see someone saying I am late. I mean I see someone saying I am late. How bad is this? As Tor pointed out and How bad is this? As Tor pointed out and How bad is this? As Tor pointed out and. You can read that blog post that's you can read that blog post that's you can read that blog post that's. Posted above, this bug was discovered by posted above, this bug was discovered by. Posted above, this bug was discovered by Elliot friend who's here on this Elliot friend who's here on this. Elliot friend who's here on this call. who's who is a senior developer call. who's who is a senior developer. Call. who's who is a senior developer advocate at the Stellar Development advocate at the Stellar Development. Advocate at the Stellar Development Foundation and he discovered it while he Foundation and he discovered it while he. Foundation and he discovered it while he was you know doing some work to get was you know doing some work to get. Was you know doing some work to get ready for a hackathon that's coming up ready for a hackathon that's coming up. Ready for a hackathon that's coming up and you know short it did not take long and you know short it did not take long. And you know short it did not take long at all and you can see the timeline at all and you can see the timeline. At all and you can see the timeline there for there to be for the the there for there to be for the the. There for there to be for the the issue to be very quickly quarantined and issue to be very quickly quarantined and. Issue to be very quickly quarantined and the fix will be rolled out pretty the fix will be rolled out pretty. The fix will be rolled out pretty soon. So, while it's a bug that, you soon. So, while it's a bug that, you. Soon. So, while it's a bug that, you know, is very it's a serious bug. The know, is very it's a serious bug. The. Know, is very it's a serious bug. The impact is something that we've like impact is something that we've like. Impact is something that we've like evaluated, talk to everyone who's been evaluated, talk to everyone who's been. Evaluated, talk to everyone who's been impacted about and, you know, it's it's impacted about and, you know, it's it's. Impacted about and, you know, it's it's definitely contained at this point. , definitely contained at this point. ,. Definitely contained at this point. , so I'll let you read the post and decide so I'll let you read the post and decide. So I'll let you read the post and decide how bad it is. , but my answer is I how bad it is. , but my answer is I. How bad it is. , but my answer is I think that the response has kept it think that the response has kept it. Think that the response has kept it pretty contained and has cut it off very pretty contained and has cut it off very. Pretty contained and has cut it off very quickly. but quickly. but quickly. but. The other so at this point we have the other so at this point we have the other so at this point we have. I'm going to post here this is cap I'm going to post here this is cap I'm going to post here this is cap. yeah and as as Dimma points out above yeah and as as Dimma points out above. Yeah and as as Dimma points out above I mean you can read what he he wrote in I mean you can read what he he wrote in. I mean you can read what he he wrote in response to your question too. Response to your question too. Response to your question too. So, I know there's a lot of of of So, I know there's a lot of of of So, I know there's a lot of of of. Discussion going on, but at this point, discussion going on, but at this point, discussion going on, but at this point,. I also think it's important to take this I also think it's important to take this. I also think it's important to take this opportunity to look at the proposed opportunity to look at the proposed. Opportunity to look at the proposed solution, which is what I just pasted solution, which is what I just pasted. Solution, which is what I just pasted there. It's a core advancement proposal there. It's a core advancement proposal. There. It's a core advancement proposal 76. 76. 76. And we have some people from the core And we have some people from the core And we have some people from the core. Team to walk through this. , Nico, do team to walk through this. , Nico, do team to walk through this. , Nico, do. You want to do it or or is it better if you want to do it or or is it better if you want to do it or or is it better if. Dimma does it?  I can I can Yeah. take a first stab at  I can I can Yeah. take a first stab at. It. it. it. guess hear me? Okay,  perfect.  perfect.  All right. So yeah, so like at a high  All right. So yeah, so like at a high.  All right. So yeah, so like at a high level what the cap is describing is . Level what the cap is describing is level what the cap is describing is first what is actually in scope for. First what is actually in scope for first what is actually in scope for the to to kind of mitigate this. The to to kind of mitigate this the to to kind of mitigate this problem. So like Toma was explaining. Problem. So like Toma was explaining problem. So like Toma was explaining earlier there there's actually two. Earlier there there's actually two earlier there there's actually two types of entries that that u that. Types of entries that that u that types of entries that that u that were corrupted. Were corrupted. Were corrupted. they both started in the same way they both started in the same way they both started in the same way. Where they basically entries got moved where they basically entries got moved where they basically entries got moved. From the live ledger state into the from the live ledger state into the from the live ledger state into the. Archive and during that process archive and during that process archive and during that process . Entries got corrupted entries got corrupted entries got corrupted and then after that some of those got. And then after that some of those got and then after that some of those got restored and at that point they were. Restored and at that point they were restored and at that point they were restored for all sorts of purpose. It. Restored for all sorts of purpose. It restored for all sorts of purpose. It could be for just reading them. Could be for just reading them could be for just reading them like a you know a lot of entries on. Like a you know a lot of entries on like a you know a lot of entries on on in Sorban are just accessed for. On in Sorban are just accessed for on in Sorban are just accessed for for reads like a WAM for example is. For reads like a WAM for example is for reads like a WAM for example is an example of that. others were also. An example of that. others were also an example of that. others were also accessed for modification. Accessed for modification. Accessed for modification. and yeah but what what the cap is and yeah but what what the cap is and yeah but what what the cap is. is putting in scope is the only is putting in scope is the only is putting in scope is the only. The first category of of entry. So the first category of of entry. So the first category of of entry. So. Basically the ones that were moved into basically the ones that were moved into basically the ones that were moved into. The archived and kind of stayed there. The archived and kind of stayed there. The archived and kind of stayed there. and and and the the solution as part of this is the the solution as part of this is. The the solution as part of this is is is to basically go and is is to basically go and. is is to basically go and take the value that was supposed to take the value that was supposed to. Take the value that was supposed to be in the archive and then override be in the archive and then override. Be in the archive and then override the the archive with that expected the the archive with that expected. The the archive with that expected value. So the fix itself sounds fairly value. So the fix itself sounds fairly. Value. So the fix itself sounds fairly fairly simple. U because it is the u the fairly simple. U because it is the u the. Fairly simple. U because it is the u the bit the the bit of a challenging part bit the the bit of a challenging part. Bit the the bit of a challenging part here is how can you all of you guys here is how can you all of you guys. Here is how can you all of you guys can trust us that this is the right list can trust us that this is the right list. Can trust us that this is the right list and there's actually quite a bit of and there's actually quite a bit of. And there's actually quite a bit of work that went into this in in the work that went into this in in the. Work that went into this in in the the cap. So the there's a full list of the cap. So the there's a full list of. The cap. So the there's a full list of of basically of in a CSV file of basically of in a CSV file . of basically of in a CSV file that you will find where you will see that you will find where you will see. That you will find where you will see for each of those entries that end up in. For each of those entries that end up in for each of those entries that end up in. The archive we have the ledger number the archive we have the ledger number. The archive we have the ledger number where when the the entry got moved. Where when the the entry got moved where when the the entry got moved. Into the archive corrupted like I said. Into the archive corrupted like I said. Into the archive corrupted like I said. So in that case we actually have in this So in that case we actually have in this. So in that case we actually have in this CSV the the value of the of the entry as. CSV the the value of the of the entry as CSV the the value of the of the entry as. It was at the moment it was about to get it was at the moment it was about to get. It was at the moment it was about to get moved. And then we also have in the same. Moved. And then we also have in the same moved. And then we also have in the same. Row like the value that of the row like the value that of the row like the value that of the. Corrupted u entry and and then what corrupted u entry and and then what corrupted u entry and and then what. Happens when we when we are going to happens when we when we are going to happens when we when we are going to. u follow the this cap right is the u follow the this cap right is the . u follow the this cap right is the core is going to to scan those entries core is going to to scan those entries. Core is going to to scan those entries one by one and see the ones that match one by one and see the ones that match. One by one and see the ones that match the corrupted state in the archive and the corrupted state in the archive and. The corrupted state in the archive and then if the if it's if it's there it then if the if it's if it's there it. Then if the if it's if it's there it should be because we should be because we. Should be because we also froze restoration at this point. Also froze restoration at this point. Also froze restoration at this point. then the the value will get then the the value will get then the the value will get . Replaced by what it should have been. So replaced by what it should have been. So. Replaced by what it should have been. So that's kind of like like the the that's kind of like like the the. That's kind of like like the the first part I guess of of this fix. first part I guess of of this fix. . First part I guess of of this fix. there's another one that's this one is there's another one that's this one is. There's another one that's this one is actually related to this second actually related to this second. actually related to this second set of entries that actually got set of entries that actually got . Set of entries that actually got restored. that's for the total lumen restored. that's for the total lumen. Restored. that's for the total lumen supply. they were about I think it's supply. they were about I think it's. Supply. they were about I think it's like three lumen around that like of like three lumen around that like of . Like three lumen around that like of accounting discrepancy. So in the accounting discrepancy. So in the. Accounting discrepancy. So in the proposal what we are saying is that well proposal what we are saying is that well. Proposal what we are saying is that well some lumen got got burned in during some lumen got got burned in during. Some lumen got got burned in during this event this event this event we're going to just kind of for. we're going to just kind of for we're going to just kind of for accounting purpose move that burn as. Accounting purpose move that burn as accounting purpose move that burn as a into the fee pool. So that's kind of. A into the fee pool. So that's kind of a into the fee pool. So that's kind of what the mitigation is for for that. What the mitigation is for for that. What the mitigation is for for that. So in terms of like the So in terms of like the So in terms of like the the like I said like the so this is. The like I said like the so this is the like I said like the so this is the CSV CSV file what the what core is. The CSV CSV file what the what core is the CSV CSV file what the what core is going to do as part of like. Going to do as part of like going to do as part of like in terms of like actual steps right. in terms of like actual steps right in terms of like actual steps right to to restore the entries in the archive. To to restore the entries in the archive to to restore the entries in the archive. To the right value to the right value to the right value in terms of like verification. So. in terms of like verification. So in terms of like verification. So there like a few things that can be. There like a few things that can be there like a few things that can be done. There's first there's the list. Done. There's first there's the list done. There's first there's the list itself. this one was computed . Itself. this one was computed itself. this one was computed by instrumenting core and replay. By instrumenting core and replay by instrumenting core and replay all those events that are around. All those events that are around all those events that are around eviction. Eviction. Eviction. The version of core that will go out the version of core that will go out the version of core that will go out. With the protocol change will will have with the protocol change will will have with the protocol change will will have. This instrumentation this instrumentation this instrumentation and better than that actually it will. And better than that actually it will and better than that actually it will. Also have a a way to basically use also have a a way to basically use also have a a way to basically use. That CSV file and check that the that CSV file and check that the that CSV file and check that the. Modification those those changes are modification those those changes are modification those those changes are. The only changes that happened in the the only changes that happened in the. The only changes that happened in the in that time period. So it's kind of a in that time period. So it's kind of a. In that time period. So it's kind of a double you know double double use in double you know double double use in. Double you know double double use in a way where the CSV file you can use it a way where the CSV file you can use it. A way where the CSV file you can use it first to see what is the full list of of first to see what is the full list of of. First to see what is the full list of of impacted entries to also see which ones impacted entries to also see which ones. Impacted entries to also see which ones will be restored and you can also use will be restored and you can also use. Will be restored and you can also use that as a way to understand that what that as a way to understand that what. That as a way to understand that what will happen with protocol 24 and also will happen with protocol 24 and also. Will happen with protocol 24 and also which one which of those entries which one which of those entries. Which one which of those entries will will not be impacted by this will will not be impacted by this . Will will not be impacted by this protocol. upgrade in which case they protocol. upgrade in which case they. Protocol. upgrade in which case they will stay corrupted as they are today will stay corrupted as they are today. Will stay corrupted as they are today on the So those are like the entries on the So those are like the entries. On the So those are like the entries that are in yeah that got restored so that are in yeah that got restored so. That are in yeah that got restored so those are like live entries those are like live entries. Those are like live entries so maybe I should stop here for a bit so maybe I should stop here for a bit. So maybe I should stop here for a bit see if there are like specific questions I just want to add one thing because I. I just want to add one thing because I got some questions on this earlier today got some questions on this earlier today. Got some questions on this earlier today the the patched version of core that the the patched version of core that. the the patched version of core that is currently in production by tier one is currently in production by tier one. Is currently in production by tier one validators bans every transaction validators bans every transaction. Validators bans every transaction that tries to touch any of the state that tries to touch any of the state. That tries to touch any of the state that's been corrupted. That's those 87 that's been corrupted. That's those 87. That's been corrupted. That's those 87 ledger entries. so if for some reason ledger entries. so if for some reason. Ledger entries. so if for some reason anyone on this call or anyone you're anyone on this call or anyone you're. anyone on this call or anyone you're talking to is unable to get a talking to is unable to get a. Talking to is unable to get a transaction in and and is getting a transaction in and and is getting a. Transaction in and and is getting a timeout because of just getting timeout because of just getting. Timeout because of just getting timeout then this might be because timeout then this might be because . Timeout then this might be because you're trying to touch that state. . You're trying to touch that state. you're trying to touch that state. . And part of protocol 24 is removing and part of protocol 24 is removing and part of protocol 24 is removing. That ban. So, that ban is supposed to be that ban. So, that ban is supposed to be. That ban. So, that ban is supposed to be removed as soon as the protocol is in. Removed as soon as the protocol is in removed as soon as the protocol is in. Effect. which is right now effect. which is right now effect. which is right now . Scheduled for Wednesday next week scheduled for Wednesday next week scheduled for Wednesday next week . 5:00 p.m. EDC.  And again, that's a small number small  And again, that's a small number small. Number of ledger entries, right? Number of ledger entries, right? Number of ledger entries, right?  Yeah. Just for just for context,  Yeah. Just for just for context, .  Yeah. Just for just for context, you know, ledger Stellar is a database. You know, ledger Stellar is a database. You know, ledger Stellar is a database. you can you know think of these you can you know think of these you can you know think of these. Ledger entries as row rows in the ledger entries as row rows in the ledger entries as row rows in the.

Contain new ZK features? No. the the contain new ZK features? No. the the contain new ZK features? No. the the. Features that were planned for the ZK features that were planned for the ZK features that were planned for the ZK.

Protocol. Protocol 24 is protocol. Protocol 24 is protocol. Protocol 24 is. Just a stability upgrade. Mootz has a question to clarify this cap Mootz has a question to clarify this cap. Focuses on managing the existing focuses on managing the existing focuses on managing the existing. Corrupted entries. Was there a corrupted entries. Was there a corrupted entries. Was there a. Cap/update that could be shared that cap/update that could be shared that cap/update that could be shared that. Addresses the root cause of generating addresses the root cause of generating addresses the root cause of generating. Corrupted entries? Yes. definitely this protocol 24 Yes. definitely this protocol 24 will fix the debug. yeah, actually I. Will fix the debug. yeah, actually I will fix the debug. yeah, actually I thought we included the fix itself in. I thought we included the fix itself in I thought we included the fix itself in the the cap. So if we didn't, I'm. The the cap. So if we didn't, I'm the the cap. So if we didn't, I'm sorry about that. But yeah, it should be. Sorry about that. But yeah, it should be sorry about that. But yeah, it should be. There. There. There. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, like we could add it to the cap for like we could add it to the cap for. Like we could add it to the cap for posterity. Like we typically don't posterity. Like we typically don't. Posterity. Like we typically don't include bug fixes in the cup because include bug fixes in the cup because. Include bug fixes in the cup because it's like two lines fix and you do it's like two lines fix and you do. It's like two lines fix and you do not do anything new from the protocol not do anything new from the protocol. Not do anything new from the protocol standpoint. Standpoint. Standpoint. Like you already have a cap defined for Like you already have a cap defined for Like you already have a cap defined for. This feature. The issue is not the this feature. The issue is not the this feature. The issue is not the. Protocol but the issue is that protocol but the issue is that protocol but the issue is that. Implementation was incorrect. But the implementation was incorrect. But the implementation was incorrect. But the. Cap itself is cap 62 I believe. so cap itself is cap 62 I believe. so cap itself is cap 62 I believe. so. You know we got added to the cap like you know we got added to the cap like you know we got added to the cap like. That we also fixing the bug but it's not that we also fixing the bug but it's not. That we also fixing the bug but it's not that historic historically done for the that historic historically done for the. That historic historically done for the bug fixes. Bug fixes. Bug fixes. Sorry about that. Of course, I asked as several people are Of course, I asked as several people are. Typing. Just to confirm, will this require a Just to confirm, will this require a network pause? No. I see there are some questions about the I see there are some questions about the. Features that were planned for protocol features that were planned for protocol features that were planned for protocol. 24 that will now be for protocol 25. If 24 that will now be for protocol 25. If 24 that will now be for protocol 25. If. You scroll up and you grab that cap, you you scroll up and you grab that cap, you. You scroll up and you grab that cap, you can actually look at the different can actually look at the different. Can actually look at the different proposals for things that relate to ZK proposals for things that relate to ZK. Proposals for things that relate to ZK features. And I think you can dig into features. And I think you can dig into. Features. And I think you can dig into those. But for now, I think we should those. But for now, I think we should. Those. But for now, I think we should kind of keep this focused on the on the kind of keep this focused on the on the. Kind of keep this focused on the on the current situation, current situation, current situation,. The current upgrade the current upgrade the current upgrade because I think it's also important. ,. Because I think it's also important. , because I think it's also important. ,. I mean, Nico, you sort of talked through I mean, Nico, you sort of talked through. I mean, Nico, you sort of talked through a lot of this, but can you just tell us a lot of this, but can you just tell us. A lot of this, but can you just tell us what happens next? So in terms of you mean like So in terms of you mean like implementation so and and all this. So. Implementation so and and all this. So implementation so and and all this. So like the team already has been . Like the team already has been like the team already has been very busy actually implementing this. Very busy actually implementing this very busy actually implementing this u this protocol change. U this protocol change. U this protocol change. given the yeah the urgency of getting given the yeah the urgency of getting. given the yeah the urgency of getting this voted as you know as soon as this voted as you know as soon as. This voted as you know as soon as possible so that we can you know like possible so that we can you know like . Possible so that we can you know like like Toma was saying part of this is like Toma was saying part of this is. Like Toma was saying part of this is also allows the the network to to to also allows the the network to to to. also allows the the network to to to unblock those those entries as unblock those those entries as. unblock those those entries as well. So yeah it's a it's there are many well. So yeah it's a it's there are many. Well. So yeah it's a it's there are many reasons that why we want this to to reasons that why we want this to to. Reasons that why we want this to to happen as quickly as possible. the happen as quickly as possible. the . Happen as quickly as possible. the so yeah in terms of next step what's so yeah in terms of next step what's. So yeah in terms of next step what's going to happen is that so we are going to happen is that so we are . Going to happen is that so we are going to have builds of Stellar core and going to have builds of Stellar core and. Going to have builds of Stellar core and the the rest of the like platform type the the rest of the like platform type. The the rest of the like platform type of software that depends directly on of software that depends directly on. Of software that depends directly on Stellar core released by Stellar core released by. Stellar core released by  that's like Horizon RPC galaxy.  that's like Horizon RPC galaxy.  that's like Horizon RPC galaxy.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then those will be  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then those will be.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then those will be released by Monday. and then what. Released by Monday. and then what released by Monday. and then what we expect to do is Tuesday will be. We expect to do is Tuesday will be we expect to do is Tuesday will be the test net upgrade to this new. The test net upgrade to this new the test net upgrade to this new protocol protocol. Protocol and then we'll get the the vote to and then we'll get the the vote to . And then we'll get the the vote to with with the validators to be scheduled. With with the validators to be scheduled with with the validators to be scheduled. On Wednesday and hopefully given that on Wednesday and hopefully given that. On Wednesday and hopefully given that we did a lot of work already with with we did a lot of work already with with. We did a lot of work already with with those validators the vote will actually those validators the vote will actually. Those validators the vote will actually be approved and meaning that we'll be approved and meaning that we'll. Be approved and meaning that we'll be back in in business in general be back in in business in general. Be back in in business in general at that time at that time at that time  and so just in general to prepare if.  and so just in general to prepare if  and so just in general to prepare if. People run infrastructure that basically people run infrastructure that basically. People run infrastructure that basically has Stellar core embedded in it so has Stellar core embedded in it so. Has Stellar core embedded in it so either Stellar core for a validator or either Stellar core for a validator or. Either Stellar core for a validator or those things that are on the platform those things that are on the platform. Those things that are on the platform side that Nico mentioned RPC horizon side that Nico mentioned RPC horizon. Side that Nico mentioned RPC horizon galaxy galaxy galaxy you'll need to upgrade right before the. You'll need to upgrade right before the you'll need to upgrade right before the test net if you want to your. test net if you want to your test net if you want to your infrastructure to work on test net and. Infrastructure to work on test net and infrastructure to work on test net and before the mainet floats. That means you. Before the mainet floats. That means you before the mainet floats. That means you. Have to like pick up the fixes, the the have to like pick up the fixes, the the have to like pick up the fixes, the the. New releases on Monday. But unlike other new releases on Monday. But unlike other. New releases on Monday. But unlike other protocol protocol upgrades, this doesn't. Protocol protocol upgrades, this doesn't protocol protocol upgrades, this doesn't. Require everyone to install new SDKs. Require everyone to install new SDKs. Require everyone to install new SDKs. Correct. Correct. Correct.  That's correct. Yeah. It's only  That's correct. Yeah. It's only .  That's correct. Yeah. It's only there's no impact to the XDR in there's no impact to the XDR in. There's no impact to the XDR in particular. And because of that, that particular. And because of that, that. Particular. And because of that, that means that applications means that applications. Means that applications in general don't actually need to in general don't actually need to . in general don't actually need to to do anything. It's basically like to do anything. It's basically like. To do anything. It's basically like about picking up the It's already about about picking up the It's already about. About picking up the It's already about picking up the right version of core at picking up the right version of core at. Picking up the right version of core at this point. This point. This point. The reason we have to upgrade systems The reason we have to upgrade systems. The reason we have to upgrade systems like RPC and Horizon is because like RPC and Horizon is because . Like RPC and Horizon is because there's actually a check in the those there's actually a check in the those. There's actually a check in the those systems that that check that the systems that that check that the. Systems that that check that the protocol version protocol version protocol version. That core is that the network is that core is that the network is that core is that the network is. Running on. So in this case it will you running on. So in this case it will you running on. So in this case it will you. Know after the vote it will switch to know after the vote it will switch to know after the vote it will switch to. 24. 24. 24. so like the systems are actually so like the systems are actually so like the systems are actually. Built with a safety in place that they built with a safety in place that they built with a safety in place that they. Will only ingest data from a protocol will only ingest data from a protocol will only ingest data from a protocol. That they understand. and so that they understand. and so that they understand. and so. Basically this is this constant and basically this is this constant and basically this is this constant and. That's the only that's the only that's the only that's the only that's the only that's the only. Change really in those downstream change really in those downstream change really in those downstream. Systems. Systems. Systems.  I'd like to answer Adam's question.  I'd like to answer Adam's question.  I'd like to answer Adam's question. so Adam asked if a reserve asset so Adam asked if a reserve asset so Adam asked if a reserve asset . Is added to the pool they are tokens is added to the pool they are tokens is added to the pool they are tokens. Created inside the contract it won't created inside the contract it won't created inside the contract it won't. Require a deposit of the actual assets require a deposit of the actual assets require a deposit of the actual assets. To reconcile. so we did have a few to reconcile. so we did have a few. To reconcile. so we did have a few of these ledger entries ended up being of these ledger entries ended up being. Of these ledger entries ended up being ledger entries that relate to to ledger entries that relate to to. Ledger entries that relate to to liquidity pools. and the remediation liquidity pools. and the remediation. Liquidity pools. and the remediation u is a bit different between different u is a bit different between different. U is a bit different between different pools and different assets. so for pools and different assets. so for. Pools and different assets. so for some assets that changed some assets that changed . Some assets that changed imbalance if they have a centralized imbalance if they have a centralized. Imbalance if they have a centralized issuer it was fairly simple to issuer it was fairly simple to. Issuer it was fairly simple to basically add the backing asset basically add the backing asset . Basically add the backing asset and and offchain so that they can and and offchain so that they can. And and offchain so that they can reconcile the issue. in some reconcile the issue. in some . Reconcile the issue. in some other situations it was it was other situations it was it was . Other situations it was it was almost trivial to to burn if if there almost trivial to to burn if if there. Almost trivial to to burn if if there was a eronous credit for some was a eronous credit for some. Was a eronous credit for some pools some liquidity pools are sorry are pools some liquidity pools are sorry are. Pools some liquidity pools are sorry are implemented in different ways. so for. Implemented in different ways. so for implemented in different ways. so for. Example the Aquarius pool is example the Aquarius pool is example the Aquarius pool is. Implemented in a way in which implemented in a way in which implemented in a way in which . Actually adding an asset doesn't actually adding an asset doesn't actually adding an asset doesn't . Change the price or anything because change the price or anything because change the price or anything because. Aquarius has like internal tracking of Aquarius has like internal tracking of Aquarius has like internal tracking of. The of the reserves and so manually the of the reserves and so manually the of the reserves and so manually. Adding a reserve doesn't actually adding a reserve doesn't actually adding a reserve doesn't actually . Impact price and and and that added impact price and and and that added impact price and and and that added. Balance is is unusable. it's not it's balance is is unusable. it's not it's. Balance is is unusable. it's not it's not like that for for source swap and so. Not like that for for source swap and so not like that for for source swap and so. It's really different assets and it's really different assets and it's really different assets and. Different protocols like found different protocols like found different protocols like found. Different ways to fix it. but again different ways to fix it. but again different ways to fix it. but again. We've talked to pretty much every we've talked to pretty much every we've talked to pretty much every. Affected protocol and issuer and affected protocol and issuer and affected protocol and issuer and. Ensured that all of them have ways to ensured that all of them have ways to. Ensured that all of them have ways to fix the situation in the context of fix the situation in the context of. Fix the situation in the context of these 77 ledger entries. Sorry, I these 77 ledger entries. Sorry, I. These 77 ledger entries. Sorry, I said the wrong number before. It's 77, said the wrong number before. It's 77,. Said the wrong number before. It's 77, not 87. and I can't stress enough how and I can't stress enough how helpful every protocol and asset. Helpful every protocol and asset helpful every protocol and asset issuer have been. , I think we started. Issuer have been. , I think we started issuer have been. , I think we started. Reaching out Friday night and Saturday reaching out Friday night and Saturday reaching out Friday night and Saturday. Morning and we've and everyone has been morning and we've and everyone has been morning and we've and everyone has been. Extremely extremely extremely understanding and and collaborative understanding and and collaborative. understanding and and collaborative and and it's awesome to see the and and it's awesome to see the. And and it's awesome to see the ecosystem come together like this. I see there's still some people typing I see there's still some people typing in the chat. ,. In the chat. , in the chat. , if the questions wind down is I think a if the questions wind down is I think a. If the questions wind down is I think a lot of it's just sort of comments. Lot of it's just sort of comments. Lot of it's just sort of comments. I'd say if you have a question, get it I'd say if you have a question, get it I'd say if you have a question, get it. In now. It's telling me OrbitLens has a It's telling me OrbitLens has a question, but Orbit asked, "Do we need. Question, but Orbit asked, "Do we need question, but Orbit asked, "Do we need to update the RPCs as well?" and . To update the RPCs as well?" and to update the RPCs as well?" and George from the platform team said yes. George from the platform team said yes. George from the platform team said yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah. Is there a technical reason this must be Is there a technical reason this must be. A protocol version upgrade instead of a a protocol version upgrade instead of a a protocol version upgrade instead of a. Patch release? Well, yes. , like it's a it's a it's Well, yes. , like it's a it's a it's an update to the ledger and because of. An update to the ledger and because of an update to the ledger and because of that it has to happen basically on all. That it has to happen basically on all that it has to happen basically on all machines at once. It was going to be. Machines at once. It was going to be machines at once. It was going to be like a patch release. , yeah, we would. Like a patch release. , yeah, we would like a patch release. , yeah, we would. Only be able to kind of the the change only be able to kind of the the change only be able to kind of the the change. Would happen basically on like whatever would happen basically on like whatever would happen basically on like whatever. Machine is running right on that with machine is running right on that with machine is running right on that with. That patch version. Is this recorded for playback, Carsten? Is this recorded for playback, Carsten? Yes, correct. Yeah, I would say in general if you know Yeah, I would say in general if you know. You have further questions or it's a you have further questions or it's a you have further questions or it's a. Good idea to read that blog. It just good idea to read that blog.

To the caps. , we do try to be as transparent about any of these changes transparent about any of these changes. Transparent about any of these changes as possible. And obviously we you know as possible. And obviously we you know. As possible. And obviously we you know through all of this we we not only through all of this we we not only. Through all of this we we not only couldn't make a decision without all the couldn't make a decision without all the. Couldn't make a decision without all the feedback from the ecosystem about what feedback from the ecosystem about what. Feedback from the ecosystem about what to implement but implementation is just to implement but implementation is just. To implement but implementation is just one step in governance and the actual one step in governance and the actual. One step in governance and the actual adoption of a protocol change on the adoption of a protocol change on the. Adoption of a protocol change on the network requires validators to vote it network requires validators to vote it. Network requires validators to vote it in. So in all of this we we always are in. So in all of this we we always are. In. So in all of this we we always are trying to talk to people including you trying to talk to people including you. Trying to talk to people including you know this call but also online and know this call but also online and . Know this call but also online and various other platforms and we're trying various other platforms and we're trying. Various other platforms and we're trying to like put the work out there in a to like put the work out there in a. To like put the work out there in a place where you can examine it and place where you can examine it and. Place where you can examine it and understand it and we certainly encourage understand it and we certainly encourage. Understand it and we certainly encourage you to do that. In fact, with the CAP, you to do that. In fact, with the CAP,. You to do that. In fact, with the CAP, there's a whole process for core there's a whole process for core. there's a whole process for core advancement proposals and as part of advancement proposals and as part of. Advancement proposals and as part of it, we put them into final comment it, we put them into final comment. It, we put them into final comment period. And because of the urgency here, period. And because of the urgency here,. Period. And because of the urgency here, we just fast forwarded this to final we just fast forwarded this to final. We just fast forwarded this to final comment period. and so it's it's comment period. and so it's it's. Comment period. and so it's it's going to stay in final comment period, going to stay in final comment period,. Going to stay in final comment period, which means that you can write about it which means that you can write about it. Which means that you can write about it on on the Stellar Dev mailing list until on on the Stellar Dev mailing list until. On on the Stellar Dev mailing list until the time that the validator vote the time that the validator vote. The time that the validator vote happens, which should be on Wednesday. Happens, which should be on Wednesday. Happens, which should be on Wednesday. So, this cap is officially in final So, this cap is officially in final So, this cap is officially in final. Comment period. You know, we definitely comment period. You know, we definitely comment period. You know, we definitely. Urge you to take a look if you have urge you to take a look if you have urge you to take a look if you have. Anything to say to add it. Orbit is pointing out the short Orbit is pointing out the short timeline. Yeah, it is a short timeline. I agree. Yeah, it is a short timeline. I agree. , yeah, like , yeah, like , yeah, like the reason we the reason we. The reason we we are still kind we think this is best we are still kind we think this is best. We are still kind we think this is best for the ecosystem is that we are for the ecosystem is that we are. For the ecosystem is that we are actually giving at this point like actually giving at this point like . Actually giving at this point like yeah like a you know almost a week yeah like a you know almost a week . Yeah like a you know almost a week notice that this is coming. So the notice that this is coming. So the. Notice that this is coming. So the people should be able to to prepare people should be able to to prepare. People should be able to to prepare ahead of you know and allocate those ahead of you know and allocate those. Ahead of you know and allocate those two days for upgrading their two days for upgrading their. two days for upgrading their infrastructure. Infrastructure. Infrastructure. I think given the the severity of I think given the the severity of I think given the the severity of. of having those those entries of having those those entries of having those those entries . Blocked I think this is the probably blocked I think this is the probably blocked I think this is the probably. The right trade-off. Nico, Nico,  can you what will the experience be like  can you what will the experience be like.  can you what will the experience be like for somebody that needs to upgrade their. For somebody that needs to upgrade their for somebody that needs to upgrade their. RPC? RPC? RPC? Will it be difficult? Will it be difficult? Will it be difficult?  So like Yeah. No to upgrade this is  So like Yeah. No to upgrade this is .  So like Yeah. No to upgrade this is basically just like doing a a regular.

Like the assessment, you know, that we Like the assessment, you know, that we Like the assessment, you know, that we. Got from from basically everyone at this got from from basically everyone at this. Got from from basically everyone at this point is that people are going to be point is that people are going to be. Point is that people are going to be able to mitigate for the most part able to mitigate for the most part. Able to mitigate for the most part the the impact of this corruption. Well, I'll give it a few more minutes Well, I'll give it a few more minutes for some of these comments or questions. For some of these comments or questions for some of these comments or questions to come in. Know where the bug came from slash how know where the bug came from slash how it got in?  I mean like bugs or bugs. Yeah, it's  I mean like bugs or bugs. Yeah, it's. Kind of a they're always sad. what I kind of a they're always sad. what I kind of a they're always sad. what I. Can say is that yeah we had multiple can say is that yeah we had multiple can say is that yeah we had multiple. Rounds of code review. We had Well, Well, feel a little bit more typing. It seems to be witicisms more than It seems to be witicisms more than questions. Thank you for being so responsive to fix Thank you for being so responsive to fix. The issue. That's that's really nice. The issue. That's that's really nice. The issue. That's that's really nice. Yes. Again, I also want to say echo what Yes. Again, I also want to say echo what. Yes. Again, I also want to say echo what Tor said before. This has been like a Tor said before. This has been like a. Tor said before. This has been like a really cool moment where really cool moment where. Really cool moment where a lot of engineers at SDF, but also a a lot of engineers at SDF, but also a. A lot of engineers at SDF, but also a lot of people in the ecosystem have lot of people in the ecosystem have. Lot of people in the ecosystem have really stood up and provided really stood up and provided. Really stood up and provided information, given opinions, given information, given opinions, given.

Believe is is where we're at but again all of that is is an implementation all of that is is an implementation. All of that is is an implementation based on feedback from the ecosystem it based on feedback from the ecosystem it. Based on feedback from the ecosystem it actually requires validator validator actually requires validator validator. Actually requires validator validator ascent through a programmatic vote on ascent through a programmatic vote on. Ascent through a programmatic vote on the network to go live and take effect. It looks like Adam was experiencing a It looks like Adam was experiencing a timeout message. Timeout message timeout message to save you from yourself. Okay, cool. I feel like we're winding Okay, cool. I feel like we're winding down. ,. Down. , down. , and again, , some takeaways, read the and again, , some takeaways, read the.
