Okay hello everyone welcome to this okay hello everyone welcome to this week's Stellar Developer Meeting and. Week's Stellar Developer Meeting and week's Stellar Developer Meeting and today I have a couple of guests so let. Today I have a couple of guests so let today I have a couple of guests so let me bring them onto this. Stage and first of all thank you for stage and first of all thank you for joining please go ahead and introduce. Joining please go ahead and introduce joining please go ahead and introduce. Yourself I think you are well known in yourself I think you are well known in yourself I think you are well known in. The community at least from your names the community at least from your names the community at least from your names. And your projects but please thank you for inviting us people thank you for inviting us people. Know me as orbit L I am the lead know me as orbit L I am the lead know me as orbit L I am the lead. Of the team behind Stellar expert of the team behind Stellar expert of the team behind Stellar expert. Albo reflector and some other ecosystem albo reflector and some other ecosystem albo reflector and some other ecosystem. Projects and today we are here with RF projects and today we are here with RF projects and today we are here with RF. The one and the only the one and the only the one and the only RF yeah so I'm Raph and I've been doing. RF yeah so I'm Raph and I've been doing RF yeah so I'm Raph and I've been doing some business development work with. Some business development work with some business development work with reflector for a bit here helping. Reflector for a bit here helping reflector for a bit here helping doing some Outreach finding some debts. Doing some Outreach finding some debts doing some Outreach finding some debts would be a good fit and this works. Would be a good fit and this works would be a good fit and this works really well with our other project I I. Really well with our other project I really well with our other project I do kind of marketing for seller. Do kind of marketing for seller do kind of marketing for seller projects through Lumen Loop so just. Projects through Lumen Loop so just projects through Lumen Loop so just kind of just a big Outreach guy and if. Kind of just a big Outreach guy and if kind of just a big Outreach guy and if you want to know what's going on in the. You want to know what's going on in the you want to know what's going on in the community come to me but it's just. Community come to me but it's just community come to me but it's just really great to be here and be able to. Really great to be here and be able to really great to be here and be able to talk about two really good products and. Talk about two really good products and talk about two really good products and kind of jumping into it a little bit. kind of jumping into it a little bit kind of jumping into it a little bit but we're going to be talking about. But we're going to be talking about but we're going to be talking about reflector and refractor both things that. Reflector and refractor both things that reflector and refractor both things that. Are incredibly useful for devs looking are incredibly useful for devs looking are incredibly useful for devs looking. To build to build to build decentralized way on decentralized way on decentralized way on. Stell great yeah take it away I'm Stell great yeah take it away I'm Stell great yeah take it away I'm. Looking forward to this looking forward to this looking forward to this [Laughter]. [Laughter] [Laughter] presentation so reflector is a presentation so reflector is a. Presentation so reflector is a decentralized price F article for the decentralized price F article for the. Decentralized price F article for the Stell D5 smart contracts and it supports. Stell D5 smart contracts and it supports Stell D5 smart contracts and it supports. You know Financial derivatives lending you know Financial derivatives lending you know Financial derivatives lending. Borrowing protocols algorithmic stable borrowing protocols algorithmic stable borrowing protocols algorithmic stable. Coins Asset Management contracts and you coins Asset Management contracts and you. Coins Asset Management contracts and you know there's just anything that you want. Know there's just anything that you want know there's just anything that you want. To do with price feeds you can do it to do with price feeds you can do it to do with price feeds you can do it. So why are oracles important so price so why are oracles important so price. So why are oracles important so price manipulation is probably one of the most. Manipulation is probably one of the most manipulation is probably one of the most. Common vectors of attacks when you're common vectors of attacks when you're common vectors of attacks when you're. Working on D5 almost every single week working on D5 almost every single week working on D5 almost every single week. We hear about successful exploits so the we hear about successful exploits so the. We hear about successful exploits so the rule of sum is when you write defi rule of sum is when you write defi. Rule of sum is when you write defi contracts you have to you write defi contracts you have to you write defi. Contracts you have to you write defi contracts top oracles and you got to contracts top oracles and you got to. Contracts top oracles and you got to make sure that you you know you're make sure that you you know you're. Make sure that you you know you're choosing these price feeds wisely so choosing these price feeds wisely so. Choosing these price feeds wisely so again you're only as good as your Oracle again you're only as good as your Oracle. Again you're only as good as your Oracle when you're kind of sourcing your data when you're kind of sourcing your data. When you're kind of sourcing your data from somewhere from somewhere from somewhere.    else and kind of the really cool else and kind of the really cool. Else and kind of the really cool thing about reflector is that it's it's thing about reflector is that it's it's. Thing about reflector is that it's it's really built on some known brands in the really built on some known brands in the. Really built on some known brands in the ecosystems it's a def decentralized ecosystems it's a def decentralized. Ecosystems it's a def decentralized consensus that we they're agreeing on consensus that we they're agreeing on. Consensus that we they're agreeing on these price price feeds so it's these price price feeds so it's. These price price feeds so it's controlled by a multisig of reputable controlled by a multisig of reputable. Controlled by a multisig of reputable organizations on Stellar and it really organizations on Stellar and it really. Organizations on Stellar and it really helps guarantee that reliability fault helps guarantee that reliability fault. Helps guarantee that reliability fault tolerance and making sure that those tolerance and making sure that those. Tolerance and making sure that those price feeds are updated and secure price feeds are updated and secure . Price feeds are updated and secure reflector kind of relies on that Quorum reflector kind of relies on that Quorum. Reflector kind of relies on that Quorum of nodes and you can kind of see it in of nodes and you can kind of see it in. Of nodes and you can kind of see it in that picture on the dock there and it's that picture on the dock there and it's. That picture on the dock there and it's connected by seller core validators next slide. Validators next slide there so we kind of combined two there so we kind of combined two. There so we kind of combined two different Oracle approaches on chain different Oracle approaches on chain. Different Oracle approaches on chain feeds and subscriptions you can kind of feeds and subscriptions you can kind of. Feeds and subscriptions you can kind of think of it as kind of like the like we think of it as kind of like the like we. Think of it as kind of like the like we just have the price feeds rest rest the just have the price feeds rest rest the. Just have the price feeds rest rest the free and then subscriptions which is free and then subscriptions which is. Free and then subscriptions which is kind of like a pro level of of of these kind of like a pro level of of of these. Kind of like a pro level of of of these price feeds what's really cool about price feeds what's really cool about. Price feeds what's really cool about reflector is that at its base it's free reflector is that at its base it's free. Reflector is that at its base it's free like all that data anybody can plug into like all that data anybody can plug into. Like all that data anybody can plug into you don't really need to pay for it but you don't really need to pay for it but. You don't really need to pay for it but if you do there's some really cool if you do there's some really cool. If you do there's some really cool things that you can you can you can kind things that you can you can you can kind. Things that you can you can you can kind of set for yourself some automations and. Of set for yourself some automations and of set for yourself some automations and. some some Communications some some some Communications some some some Communications some. Notifications for that could be notifications for that could be notifications for that could be. Useful when you're developing so useful when you're developing so useful when you're developing so . Onchain price feeds are free for onchain price feeds are free for onchain price feeds are free for. Everyone the interface allows for a set everyone the interface allows for a set everyone the interface allows for a set. 40 compatibility standard all the price 40 compatibility standard all the price 40 compatibility standard all the price. Feed data is stored in the contract feed data is stored in the contract feed data is stored in the contract. Itself in a fixed time frame I think itself in a fixed time frame I think itself in a fixed time frame I think. Free is interval of every five minutes free is interval of every five minutes free is interval of every five minutes. So the data is readily available for all so the data is readily available for all. So the data is readily available for all consumer contracts the use Oracle consumer contracts the use Oracle. Consumer contracts the use Oracle quoted price results through directly in quoted price results through directly in. Quoted price results through directly in the same function it's efficient it's the same function it's efficient it's. The same function it's efficient it's optimized low fees and it greatly optimized low fees and it greatly. Optimized low fees and it greatly reduces the number of contract calls so reduces the number of contract calls so. Reduces the number of contract calls so again we're trying to make sure that again we're trying to make sure that. Again we're trying to make sure that it's efficient for your defi apps to it's efficient for your defi apps to. It's efficient for your defi apps to kind of plug into offchain Data or kind of plug into offchain Data or. Kind of plug into offchain Data or classic data subscriptions on the classic data subscriptions on the. Classic data subscriptions on the other hand provide kind of like a more other hand provide kind of like a more. Other hand provide kind of like a more fine grain data access with kind of user fine grain data access with kind of user. Fine grain data access with kind of user defined customable customizable triggers. Defined customable customizable triggers defined customable customizable triggers. with up to one minute sampling with up to one minute sampling with up to one minute sampling . Which again unlocks a lot of use cases which again unlocks a lot of use cases which again unlocks a lot of use cases. With that one minute sampling this with that one minute sampling this with that one minute sampling this. Service provides kind of access to a service provides kind of access to a service provides kind of access to a. Much wider range of available price much wider range of available price much wider range of available price. Feeds private web hooks invocations feeds private web hooks invocations feeds private web hooks invocations. In combination with onchain execution in combination with onchain execution in combination with onchain execution. Proofs and then it guarantees again proofs and then it guarantees again proofs and then it guarantees again. Stability and security so highlights the Oracle security so highlights the Oracle. Contract provides a kind kind of contract provides a kind kind of contract provides a kind kind of. Comprehensible interface again for step comprehensible interface again for step comprehensible interface again for step. 40 the ecosystem standard and on top of 40 the ecosystem standard and on top of 40 the ecosystem standard and on top of. That kind of offer like automatic cross that kind of offer like automatic cross that kind of offer like automatic cross. Price calculations utility functions price calculations utility functions price calculations utility functions . Tww AP range approximations last but tww AP range approximations last but tww AP range approximations last but. Not least onchain data is again like we not least onchain data is again like we not least onchain data is again like we. Said it's completely free so kind of go said it's completely free so kind of go said it's completely free so kind of go. Ahead and use it I feel like doing ahead and use it I feel like doing ahead and use it I feel like doing. Onre is such a sorry we're doing Onre is such a sorry we're doing Onre is such a sorry we're doing. Outreach is kind of a weird thing Outreach is kind of a weird thing Outreach is kind of a weird thing.

To use a system that's safe and that's kind of why these nodes that we we've kind of why these nodes that we we've. Kind of why these nodes that we we've kind of we work with are incredibly kind of we work with are incredibly.

Important that we want to make sure that you know you like these or these you know you like these or these. you know you like these or these these node providers are securing these node providers are securing. These node providers are securing everyone's defi apps so they're just everyone's defi apps so they're just. Everyone's defi apps so they're just kind of incredible importance with you kind of incredible importance with you. Kind of incredible importance with you know making sure that consensus know making sure that consensus. Know making sure that consensus mechanism and that decentralized nature mechanism and that decentralized nature. Mechanism and that decentralized nature of re Oracle kind of services those defi of re Oracle kind of services those defi. Of re Oracle kind of services those defi UPS okay so and that kind of brings UPS okay so and that kind of brings. UPS okay so and that kind of brings us into the Dow so you know it is it us into the Dow so you know it is it. Us into the Dow so you know it is it is a it's a cluster it's governed is a it's a cluster it's governed. Is a it's a cluster it's governed governed by governed by governed by these organizations and they they kind. These organizations and they they kind these organizations and they they kind of they serve these and maintain. Of they serve these and maintain of they serve these and maintain these reflector server nodes and they. These reflector server nodes and they these reflector server nodes and they participate in this cluster. Participate in this cluster participate in this cluster consensus so again when you want to get. Consensus so again when you want to get consensus so again when you want to get an asset listed this price feed. An asset listed this price feed an asset listed this price feed listed you really have to U make a. Listed you really have to U make a listed you really have to U make a proposal to the dell and submit with. Proposal to the dell and submit with proposal to the dell and submit with the tokens same with adding different. The tokens same with adding different the tokens same with adding different. Kind of price sources again you got to kind of price sources again you got to kind of price sources again you got to. Go to Dell and the Dell make the go to Dell and the Dell make the go to Dell and the Dell make the. Decisions none of it is done by one decisions none of it is done by one decisions none of it is done by one. Entity and everyone needs to agree on it entity and everyone needs to agree on it. Entity and everyone needs to agree on it and again that kind of helps secure that. And again that kind of helps secure that and again that kind of helps secure that. You know all these organizations are key you know all these organizations are key. You know all these organizations are key players in making decisions and that brings us to the. Decisions and that brings us to the Token again the token is what kind of Token again the token is what kind of. Token again the token is what kind of go makes us able to participate in the go makes us able to participate in the. Go makes us able to participate in the Dow cluster operators receive Dow cluster operators receive. Dow cluster operators receive actually tokens for participating in the actually tokens for participating in the. Actually tokens for participating in the consensus mechanisms and they provide consensus mechanisms and they provide. Consensus mechanisms and they provide like computational resources to like computational resources to. Like computational resources to aggregate validate certify so again it aggregate validate certify so again it. Aggregate validate certify so again it makes them to pay them in token makes them to pay them in token . Makes them to pay them in token correspondingly like these tokens are correspondingly like these tokens are. Correspondingly like these tokens are correspondingly acred tokens correspondingly acred tokens. correspondingly acred tokens represent the equivalent of represent the equivalent of. Represent the equivalent of computational resources contributed by computational resources contributed by. Computational resources contributed by by each party these tokens are then used by each party these tokens are then used. By each party these tokens are then used by the cluster for governance token and by the cluster for governance token and. By the cluster for governance token and subcription services so the xrf tokens subcription services so the xrf tokens. Subcription services so the xrf tokens can be used in cluster governance voting can be used in cluster governance voting. Can be used in cluster governance voting on new price feeds or new cluster on new price feeds or new cluster. On new price feeds or new cluster members members members invitations and the again serve as. Invitations and the again serve as invitations and the again serve as the backbone for the sub subscriptions. The backbone for the sub subscriptions the backbone for the sub subscriptions and they're required to create C create. And they're required to create C create and they're required to create C create custom subscriptions and and then pay. Custom subscriptions and and then pay custom subscriptions and and then pay for the upkeep of these. Subscriptions yeah and here we have a subscriptions yeah and here we have a. Few prerecorded videos with the few prerecorded videos with the few prerecorded videos with the. Interfaces because we have a lot of them interfaces because we have a lot of them. Interfaces because we have a lot of them I think I will start with the no I think I will start with the no.

Interface of subscriptions subscriptions interface of subscriptions subscriptions. Is the more advanced solution which is the more advanced solution which is the more advanced solution which. is a kind of a Swiss arment knife for is a kind of a Swiss arment knife for. is a kind of a Swiss arment knife for any developer who decides to build any developer who decides to build . Any developer who decides to build any kind of Oracle based Solution on any kind of Oracle based Solution on. Any kind of Oracle based Solution on Stellar or some other Stellar or some other. Stellar or some other chains so subscriptions is a service chains so subscriptions is a service. Chains so subscriptions is a service for user defined triggers invoked for user defined triggers invoked. For user defined triggers invoked automatically once the price deviation automatically once the price deviation. Automatically once the price deviation reaches a certain reaches a certain reaches a certain. Threshold every Oracle not independently threshold every Oracle not independently. Threshold every Oracle not independently Eves subscription condition once a Eves subscription condition once a. Eves subscription condition once a minute and consumers receive web hook minute and consumers receive web hook. Minute and consumers receive web hook notifications on triggered price changes. Notifications on triggered price changes notifications on triggered price changes. Let's see how it works in the web let's see how it works in the web let's see how it works in the web. Interface first we need to select interface first we need to select interface first we need to select. Data source for base and quote symbols data source for base and quote symbols data source for base and quote symbols. the quoted value the quoted value the quoted value is calculated as quot price divided. is calculated as quot price divided is calculated as quot price divided by base. By base by base price there are two options first price there are two options first. Price there are two options first option is aggregated price from option is aggregated price from. Option is aggregated price from exchanges and price tokens from exchanges and price tokens from. Exchanges and price tokens from Stellar public exchange for instance Stellar public exchange for instance. Stellar public exchange for instance here we select arbitrum token from here we select arbitrum token from. Here we select arbitrum token from exchanges now the base scker we can exchanges now the base scker we can. Exchanges now the base scker we can utilize the same data source or qu utilize the same data source or qu. Utilize the same data source or qu prices for a pair from two different prices for a pair from two different. Prices for a pair from two different sources this provides the ability to sources this provides the ability to. Sources this provides the ability to build a personalized Oracle on assets build a personalized Oracle on assets. Build a personalized Oracle on assets from different feeds and different from different feeds and different. From different feeds and different different asset classes the cluster different asset classes the cluster. Different asset classes the cluster will calculate the prices will calculate the prices. will calculate the prices automatically here we select yxm and automatically here we select yxm and. Automatically here we select yxm and Trigger threshold here it controls Trigger threshold here it controls. Trigger threshold here it controls the Target price deviation amplitude the Target price deviation amplitude. The Target price deviation amplitude this example it means that web hook this example it means that web hook. This example it means that web hook and point will be notified every time and point will be notified every time. And point will be notified every time the quoted price goes up or down by the quoted price goes up or down by. The quoted price goes up or down by 2% com compared to the previous 2% com compared to the previous. 2% com compared to the previous dispatched value reflector also dispatched value reflector also. Dispatched value reflector also periodically sends herbit messages periodically sends herbit messages. Periodically sends herbit messages with current quote price to let the with current quote price to let the. With current quote price to let the Upstream service know that subscription Upstream service know that subscription. Upstream service know that subscription is still active to activate the is still active to activate the. Is still active to activate the subscription we need to pay for it with subscription we need to pay for it with. Subscription we need to pay for it with xerf tokens and they also required to xerf tokens and they also required to. Xerf tokens and they also required to pay the upkeep the upkeep balance pay the upkeep the upkeep balance . Pay the upkeep the upkeep balance gets changed gets charg on the daily gets changed gets charg on the daily. Gets changed gets charg on the daily basis it is worth noting that the daily basis it is worth noting that the daily. Basis it is worth noting that the daily fee depends on the quote complexity and fee depends on the quote complexity and. Fee depends on the quote complexity and herbe interval here we can use web herbe interval here we can use web. Herbe interval here we can use web hook demo website to show how it hook demo website to show how it. Hook demo website to show how it works we'll just copy paste in the works we'll just copy paste in the. Works we'll just copy paste in the web hook URL and web hook URL and web hook URL and. that's basically it the account that's basically it the account that's basically it the account. That created the subscription will that created the subscription will that created the subscription will. Become its owner we need to confirm become its owner we need to confirm become its owner we need to confirm. The transaction and it will be the transaction and it will be the transaction and it will be. it will automatically create the it will automatically create the it will automatically create the. Subscription so basically all all the subscription so basically all all the subscription so basically all all the. Setup everything is done in the web setup everything is done in the web setup everything is done in the web. Interface interface interface here here here this description page we can see all key. This description page we can see all key this description page we can see all key. Parameters for each of the account parameters for each of the account parameters for each of the account. Subscription as well as remining up keep subscription as well as remining up keep. Subscription as well as remining up keep balance subscription balance subscription.

Here on this interface you can see here on this interface you can see here on this interface you can see. the nod notifications that come from the nod notifications that come from. The nod notifications that come from the the the cluster there was a lot of similarly. Cluster there was a lot of similarly cluster there was a lot of similarly identical post requests yet they have. Identical post requests yet they have identical post requests yet they have different signatures each reflector. Different signatures each reflector different signatures each reflector cluster node sends notifications to. Cluster node sends notifications to cluster node sends notifications to Consumers to provide redundant and. Consumers to provide redundant and Consumers to provide redundant and reliable proof of. Reliable proof of reliable proof of delivery as we can see here every delivery as we can see here every. Delivery as we can see here every incoming request contains information incoming request contains information. Incoming request contains information about the subscription quoted price and about the subscription quoted price and. About the subscription quoted price and update time update time update time stamp so. Stamp so stamp so what's next we actually developing what's next we actually developing. what's next we actually developing the protocol and the protocol and the protocol and. at the moment we're currently at the moment we're currently at the moment we're currently. Working on adding new price feeds for working on adding new price feeds for. Working on adding new price feeds for foreign exchange rates and foreign exchange rates and. Foreign exchange rates and commodities website improvements is commodities website improvements is. Commodities website improvements is another important task for us we need another important task for us we need. Another important task for us we need some more quote samples better some more quote samples better. Some more quote samples better documentation and developer support to documentation and developer support to. Documentation and developer support to make the integration for new CER as make the integration for new CER as. Make the integration for new CER as smooth as possible because smooth as possible because . Smooth as possible because sometimes R needs to go here and there sometimes R needs to go here and there. Sometimes R needs to go here and there here and back again to explain here and back again to explain. here and back again to explain something and we need something and we need. Something and we need to basically to basically to basically explain some very basic things about. explain some very basic things about explain some very basic things about oracles and our particular Oracle model. Oracles and our particular Oracle model oracles and our particular Oracle model and of course the next huge milestone. and of course the next huge milestone and of course the next huge milestone. For us is going cross chain we want for us is going cross chain we want for us is going cross chain we want. To expand our subscription service to expand our subscription service to expand our subscription service. Beyond Stellar while the Forum and do Beyond Stellar while the Forum and do. Beyond Stellar while the Forum and do smart contract logic will be working on smart contract logic will be working on. Smart contract logic will be working on Stellar Stellar Stellar network network network. because essentially subscription because essentially subscription because essentially subscription. Subscription subscription subscription service is chain agnostic and U any service is chain agnostic and U any. Service is chain agnostic and U any service any chain or even without any service any chain or even without any. Service any chain or even without any blockchain can receive these price. Blockchain can receive these price blockchain can receive these price. Notifications they just need to set up notifications they just need to set up notifications they just need to set up. Their subscription VI the web hook their subscription VI the web hook their subscription VI the web hook. Interface that's basically it about interface that's basically it about interface that's basically it about. Reflector we definitely want you to reflector we definitely want you to reflector we definitely want you to. Come to our website to join our Discord come to our website to join our Discord come to our website to join our Discord. And to talk to DS talk to other and to talk to DS talk to other and to talk to DS talk to other. People and check what you can do with people and check what you can do with. People and check what you can do with oracles because reflector is the oracles because reflector is the. Oracles because reflector is the ultimate price reference for Star ultimate price reference for Star. Ultimate price reference for Star defe I think one of the big things too defe I think one of the big things too. Defe I think one of the big things too is you can see it out in the ecosystem is you can see it out in the ecosystem. Is you can see it out in the ecosystem already like you can see it in blend already like you can see it in blend. Already like you can see it in blend like there's really cool protocols that like there's really cool protocols that. Like there's really cool protocols that are starting to build on to are starting to build on to . Are starting to build on to reflectors so again go see what's out reflectors so again go see what's out. Reflectors so again go see what's out there you know if you see what you like there you know if you see what you like. There you know if you see what you like maybe you're want to play around with maybe you're want to play around with. Maybe you're want to play around with reflector and once you're ready go check reflector and once you're ready go check. Reflector and once you're ready go check out the Discord or you know reach out to. Out the Discord or you know reach out to out the Discord or you know reach out to.

Code that at the end of the Pres that's code that at the end of the Pres that's great but if anyone anyone else has. Great but if anyone anyone else has great but if anyone anyone else has questions we still have a few minutes. Questions we still have a few minutes questions we still have a few minutes but I would like to ask a couple of. But I would like to ask a couple of but I would like to ask a couple of questions I'm. Questions I'm questions I'm thinking what what made you start build thinking what what made you start build. Thinking what what made you start build this because this is not this is not this because this is not this is not.

Just a small a small pricing price feed Oracle this is pretty comprehensive feed Oracle this is pretty comprehensive. Feed Oracle this is pretty comprehensive I mean everything from the security to I mean everything from the security to. I mean everything from the security to have it managed by da how how did you have it managed by da how how did you. Have it managed by da how how did you get started on working on this and did get started on working on this and did. Get started on working on this and did it it it start well project you know we had a. Start well project you know we had a start well project you know we had a conversation with to at the Meridian. Conversation with to at the Meridian conversation with to at the Meridian about two years ago and it was like what. About two years ago and it was like what about two years ago and it was like what. What do you want to build on what do you want to build on what do you want to build on. Seran well we have Stell expert we are seran well we have Stell expert we are seran well we have Stell expert we are. Experts in data processing so Oracle experts in data processing so Oracle experts in data processing so Oracle. Seems like an interesting thing to build seems like an interesting thing to build. Seems like an interesting thing to build but well right now maybe I'd reconsider but well right now maybe I'd reconsider. But well right now maybe I'd reconsider this decision because it was a pretty this decision because it was a pretty. This decision because it was a pretty bum perod and like I am super bum perod and like I am super. Bum perod and like I am super grateful to all our Dow members who grateful to all our Dow members who.

Am grateful to everyone who supported us am grateful to everyone who supported us. Am grateful to everyone who supported us with with with this great I think I think we have a. This great I think I think we have a this great I think I think we have a couple of questions . Couple of questions couple of questions mat has a really good one about the. Mat has a really good one about the mat has a really good one about the hackathon yeah yeah that's a pretty good. Hackathon yeah yeah that's a pretty good hackathon yeah yeah that's a pretty good. One so we we we have we've had two one so we we we have we've had two one so we we we have we've had two. Dev competitions up to date just to Dev competitions up to date just to Dev competitions up to date just to. Kind of help us highlight how the kind of help us highlight how the kind of help us highlight how the. Oracles can be used and kind of get devs oracles can be used and kind of get devs. Oracles can be used and kind of get devs playing with it we had best Oracle playing with it we had best Oracle. Playing with it we had best Oracle contracts we had Lena which is like a contracts we had Lena which is like a. Contracts we had Lena which is like a trustless loan platform that won one of trustless loan platform that won one of. Trustless loan platform that won one of the the prizes we had Pula Labs that won the the prizes we had Pula Labs that won. The the prizes we had Pula Labs that won a trusted portfolio manager that helps a trusted portfolio manager that helps. A trusted portfolio manager that helps kind of rebalance bance your portfolio kind of rebalance bance your portfolio. Kind of rebalance bance your portfolio automatically which is kind of cool and automatically which is kind of cool and. Automatically which is kind of cool and then we had kale kale pale that did then we had kale kale pale that did . Then we had kale kale pale that did his reflector predict like betting on his reflector predict like betting on. His reflector predict like betting on prices through an oracle so those were prices through an oracle so those were. Prices through an oracle so those were the three winning ones we had a bunch of the three winning ones we had a bunch of. The three winning ones we had a bunch of walkthroughs and and text writeups as walkthroughs and and text writeups as. Walkthroughs and and text writeups as well we had some you know some people well we had some you know some people. Well we had some you know some people that built some reflector clients some that built some reflector clients some. That built some reflector clients some boiler plates notification Bots again boiler plates notification Bots again. Boiler plates notification Bots again there's just kind of a lot of stuff there's just kind of a lot of stuff. There's just kind of a lot of stuff there and it kind of if you're there and it kind of if you're. There and it kind of if you're interested in reflector and seeing how interested in reflector and seeing how. Interested in reflector and seeing how it can be used going to the Discord and it can be used going to the Discord and. It can be used going to the Discord and seeing the submission submission seeing the submission submission. Seeing the submission submission sections is a really cool like list of sections is a really cool like list of. Sections is a really cool like list of different different different examples great yeah I have seen so. Examples great yeah I have seen so examples great yeah I have seen so I've been to a couple of hackathons now. I've been to a couple of hackathons now I've been to a couple of hackathons now and I've seen seen the reflector being. And I've seen seen the reflector being and I've seen seen the reflector being used and I know you mentioned kpl I. Used and I know you mentioned kpl I used and I know you mentioned kpl I know we use it in. Know we use it in know we use it in general SDF when we build build cool general SDF when we build build cool. General SDF when we build build cool stuff fun stuff when we experiment so stuff fun stuff when we experiment so. Stuff fun stuff when we experiment so but it is I have seen that both but it is I have seen that both. But it is I have seen that both slender and blend have used it too is. Slender and blend have used it too is slender and blend have used it too is. That something you are something you are that something you are something you are.

Did they come to you and say this looks did they come to you and say this looks did they come to you and say this looks. Like a really neat like a really neat like a really neat service well it started with u this. Service well it started with u this service well it started with u this this first meeting with st and people. This first meeting with st and people this first meeting with st and people when sban was still in bet and not even. When sban was still in bet and not even when sban was still in bet and not even on mayet yet so actually we partnered. On mayet yet so actually we partnered on mayet yet so actually we partnered with some key players at the. With some key players at the with some key players at the time okay great could we maybe just kind. Time okay great could we maybe just kind time okay great could we maybe just kind. Of I think we're running out of time but of I think we're running out of time but. Of I think we're running out of time but let's jump into maybe do some just a let's jump into maybe do some just a. Let's jump into maybe do some just a little touch of refractor because it little touch of refractor because it. Little touch of refractor because it is I will do pretty is I will do pretty is I will do pretty. Quick yeah so refractor is a pendant quick yeah so refractor is a pendant quick yeah so refractor is a pendant. Transaction storage and multi aggregator transaction storage and multi aggregator. Transaction storage and multi aggregator for Stellar Network it's a developer for Stellar Network it's a developer. For Stellar Network it's a developer Focus service in the first place but Focus service in the first place but . Focus service in the first place but anyone can use it to store trans ctions anyone can use it to store trans ctions. Anyone can use it to store trans ctions and G signatures required to match sign and G signatures required to match sign. And G signatures required to match sign thresold that's the service that been thresold that's the service that been. Thresold that's the service that been around since 2021 and like many active around since 2021 and like many active. Around since 2021 and like many active Dow organizations are using it like Dow organizations are using it like. Dow organizations are using it like Aquarius reflector yel blocks at some Aquarius reflector yel blocks at some. Aquarius reflector yel blocks at some point so it's a very handy toolkit for D.

Management Services like any any kind of Management Services like any any kind of. Management Services like any any kind of service that utilize Stellar service that utilize Stellar. service that utilize Stellar multi why you might need it multi why you might need it. Multi why you might need it It's tricky to check what inside It's tricky to check what inside. It's tricky to check what inside the transaction what are the the transaction what are the. The transaction what are the operations requir signatures and operations requir signatures and. Operations requir signatures and something like this when you just get something like this when you just get. Something like this when you just get some random Exar encoded transactions some random Exar encoded transactions. Some random Exar encoded transactions and someone asks you to sign it and someone asks you to sign it. And someone asks you to sign it G signatures requires sending a G signatures requires sending a. G signatures requires sending a transactions via Messengers orail or transactions via Messengers orail or. Transactions via Messengers orail or some other channel which is like not so some other channel which is like not so. Some other channel which is like not so convenient let's say it if two or convenient let's say it if two or. Convenient let's say it if two or more people sign simultaneously one of more people sign simultaneously one of. More people sign simultaneously one of the signature can be the signature can be the signature can be. Lost lost lost if someone signs the wrong transaction if someone signs the wrong transaction. If someone signs the wrong transaction everyone needs to start from fresh everyone needs to start from fresh . Everyone needs to start from fresh not enough signatures to M the threshold not enough signatures to M the threshold. Not enough signatures to M the threshold and transaction will be discarded by the. And transaction will be discarded by the and transaction will be discarded by the. Network too many signatures it will network too many signatures it will network too many signatures it will. Also be discarded by the also be discarded by the also be discarded by the network it also requires coordination. Network it also requires coordination network it also requires coordination. So someone needs to oversee the process so someone needs to oversee the process so someone needs to oversee the process. like contol the signatur submit some like contol the signatur submit some like contol the signatur submit some. Transaction submit the assigned transaction submit the assigned transaction submit the assigned. Transaction to the network Etc so we've transaction to the network Etc so we've transaction to the network Etc so we've. Been there and that's that's actually been there and that's that's actually. Been there and that's that's actually a painful experience like once you a painful experience like once you. A painful experience like once you start using multiseq at scale start using multiseq at scale. Start using multiseq at scale it's it's it's it's it's it's problematic U refractor allows you to. Problematic U refractor allows you to problematic U refractor allows you to basically upload your transaction XD. Basically upload your transaction XD basically upload your transaction XD web form just copy paste transaction. web form just copy paste transaction web form just copy paste transaction exr check selected Network click save. Exr check selected Network click save exr check selected Network click save and that's it optionally you can choose. And that's it optionally you can choose and that's it optionally you can choose Auto submit to the network option which. Auto submit to the network option which Auto submit to the network option which . which will allow the system to which will allow the system to which will allow the system to. Automatically submit transaction to the automatically submit transaction to the automatically submit transaction to the. Network once it gets enough network once it gets enough network once it gets enough. Signatures for it and after creating signatures for it and after creating signatures for it and after creating. You can simply share the link with all you can simply share the link with all you can simply share the link with all. The signers and that's it the signers and that's it the signers and that's it that's how the transaction looks. that's how the transaction looks that's how the transaction looks right and we can see here that it's much. Right and we can see here that it's much right and we can see here that it's much. Easier to understand what operations easier to understand what operations easier to understand what operations. Are inside what will be the execution are inside what will be the execution. Are inside what will be the execution result what are the probably probable. Result what are the probably probable result what are the probably probable. Consequences and consequences and consequences and Etc pinted transaction page also. Etc pinted transaction page also Etc pinted transaction page also displays all transaction details current. Displays all transaction details current displays all transaction details current. Signing status and automatically signing status and automatically signing status and automatically. Detected validity period detected validity period detected validity period .   and the key part of it and the key part of it and the key part of it. signatures reflector can automatically detect reflector can automatically detect. All possible transaction signers all possible transaction signers all possible transaction signers . Their weights and total transaction their weights and total transaction their weights and total transaction. Threshold it will show who else can threshold it will show who else can threshold it will show who else can. Sign and it basically prevents the sign and it basically prevents the sign and it basically prevents the. Situation when too many s signatures situation when too many s signatures situation when too many s signatures. Were added and transaction again be were added and transaction again be were added and transaction again be. Becomes becomes becomes valid here for example you can see valid here for example you can see . Valid here for example you can see like real world examples from Real like real world examples from Real. Like real world examples from Real World signature with different World signature with different . World signature with different thresholds how it looks in the thresholds how it looks in the. Thresholds how it looks in the process of signing and how it looks process of signing and how it looks. Process of signing and how it looks when it's fully when it's fully when it's fully. Signed web interface supports signed web interface supports signed web interface supports. Multiple wallets multiple wallets multiple wallets so there is an option so there is an option. So there is an option to sign the transaction Visa wallet of to sign the transaction Visa wallet of. To sign the transaction Visa wallet of your choice or import assigned ex your choice or import assigned ex. Your choice or import assigned ex directly so in case if you have air directly so in case if you have air. Directly so in case if you have air gab device or something like this you gab device or something like this you. Gab device or something like this you can just copy paste xdr there and can just copy paste xdr there and. Can just copy paste xdr there and reflector will combine valid signatures reflector will combine valid signatures. Reflector will combine valid signatures discard duplicates and remove all discard duplicates and remove all. Discard duplicates and remove all inapplicable signatures so it basically inapplicable signatures so it basically. Inapplicable signatures so it basically makes the process much more streamlined it's free service it's free. Streamlined it's free service it's free for businesses and individuals without for businesses and individuals without. For businesses and individuals without limitations we have some some rate limitations we have some some rate. Limitations we have some some rate limiting but you can use it for free limiting but you can use it for free. Limiting but you can use it for free it's been around since 2021 it is it's been around since 2021 it is. it's been around since 2021 it is supported by our team it receives supported by our team it receives . Supported by our team it receives some regular updates so it's been pretty some regular updates so it's been pretty. Some regular updates so it's been pretty reliable servers it is Battle tested as reliable servers it is Battle tested as. Reliable servers it is Battle tested as I told it was employed by different I told it was employed by different. I told it was employed by different DS and it has open IP so you can open DS and it has open IP so you can open. DS and it has open IP so you can open II you can integrate it directly II you can integrate it directly.

Having having a tool like this I think having having a tool like this I think having having a tool like this I think. That is super interesting I think that is super interesting I think that is super interesting I think. Actually multii maybe maybe we should do actually multii maybe maybe we should do. Actually multii maybe maybe we should do a a separate a separate presentation a a separate a separate presentation. A a separate a separate presentation on that or separate talk about that on that or separate talk about that. On that or separate talk about that because you guys definitely have some because you guys definitely have some. Because you guys definitely have some experience with that so yes so maybe I experience with that so yes so maybe I. Experience with that so yes so maybe I think that could be an interesting topic think that could be an interesting topic. Think that could be an interesting topic for for for for for for future presentation but for now we.

Working on and yeah can just encourage everyone that needs pricing feeds to everyone that needs pricing feeds to. Everyone that needs pricing feeds to start using it I mean it's it's super start using it I mean it's it's super. Start using it I mean it's it's super easy and it's it's free and it's easy and it's it's free and it's. Easy and it's it's free and it's something that allows you to scale with something that allows you to scale with. Something that allows you to scale with your with your application as well into your with your application as well into. Your with your application as well into into maybe a subscription based model so into maybe a subscription based model so. Into maybe a subscription based model so thank you for joining thanks for having thank you for joining thanks for having.
