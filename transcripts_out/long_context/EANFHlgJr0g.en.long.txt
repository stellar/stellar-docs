Sore bond for those that don't know we'll have a cool hello world demo we'll have a cool hello world demo. we'll have a cool hello world demo from Morgan and we'll talk a little from Morgan and we'll talk a little. From Morgan and we'll talk a little bit about why store Bond's important why bit about why store Bond's important why. Bit about why store Bond's important why it matters why it's good why you should it matters why it's good why you should. It matters why it's good why you should build everything on it build everything on it. Build everything on it and then we'll have a bit more for and then we'll have a bit more for. and then we'll have a bit more for Morgan on his kind of journey and how. Morgan on his kind of journey and how Morgan on his kind of journey and how. He got to sorbonne and how I got he got to sorbonne and how I got he got to sorbonne and how I got. Involved with all this and then involved with all this and then involved with all this and then . Tyler will share a bit on how you can Tyler will share a bit on how you can Tyler will share a bit on how you can. Get involved get involved get involved and then I will wrap up from there and and then I will wrap up from there and.

To work on Soroban every day building to work on Soroban every day building to work on Soroban every day building. And making it happen for all of you and making it happen for all of you and making it happen for all of you. so I'm really excited to be here so I'm really excited to be here so I'm really excited to be here. Today to share some of the stuff that today to share some of the stuff that today to share some of the stuff that. I've been working on what is the I've been working on what is the I've been working on what is the. Stellar development foundation if you Stellar development foundation if you. Stellar development foundation if you don't know and you've somehow stumbled don't know and you've somehow stumbled. Don't know and you've somehow stumbled into this stream anyway the SDF works into this stream anyway the SDF works. Into this stream anyway the SDF works with the Stellar Community which is all with the Stellar Community which is all. With the Stellar Community which is all of you to build the Stellar Network the Stellar network is a fast and. the Stellar network is a fast and reliable L1 blockchain with finality in reliable L1 blockchain with finality in. Reliable L1 blockchain with finality in just five seconds the Network's been just five seconds the Network's been. Just five seconds the Network's been live since about 2015. it and has live since about 2015. it and has. Live since about 2015. it and has seen sustained real world usage of 150 seen sustained real world usage of 150. Seen sustained real world usage of 150 transactions a second with literally no transactions a second with literally no. Transactions a second with literally no problem just cruising along which is problem just cruising along which is. Problem just cruising along which is pretty crazy to think about pretty crazy to think about. Pretty crazy to think about it has a Global Network of anchors it has a Global Network of anchors . it has a Global Network of anchors it's what we call which are on and off it's what we call which are on and off. It's what we call which are on and off on and off ramps issuing on-chain on and off ramps issuing on-chain. On and off ramps issuing on-chain versions of assets from the real world versions of assets from the real world. Versions of assets from the real world including cash access which we'll talk including cash access which we'll talk. Including cash access which we'll talk about later and for the last year we've about later and for the last year we've. About later and for the last year we've been building something new sarban so been building something new sarban so. Been building something new sarban so what is Soroban what is Soroban what is Soroban. So sorbonne is a new add-on to the so sorbonne is a new add-on to the so sorbonne is a new add-on to the. Stellar Network traditionally the Stellar Network traditionally the Stellar Network traditionally the. Vanilla stoneware Network didn't have vanilla stoneware Network didn't have vanilla stoneware Network didn't have. Smart contracts there were there was a Smart contracts there were there was a Smart contracts there were there was a. Few L2 attempts right like turrets that few L2 attempts right like turrets that few L2 attempts right like turrets that. Some of you might know but they had some some of you might know but they had some. Some of you might know but they had some issues around that like atomicity issues around that like atomicity. Issues around that like atomicity yeah and other things like that yeah and other things like that. yeah and other things like that so we wanted to open up more so we wanted to open up more. So we wanted to open up more decentralized Innovation to the network decentralized Innovation to the network. Decentralized Innovation to the network and to open up new opportunities to the and to open up new opportunities to the. And to open up new opportunities to the underserved and unbanked populations underserved and unbanked populations. Underserved and unbanked populations that Stellar's built to serve that Stellar's built to serve. That Stellar's built to serve and I mean my big thing is payments is and I mean my big thing is payments is.

Such a small part of the financial world it's like an important thing to get it's like an important thing to get. It's like an important thing to get right but it's just kind of the base right but it's just kind of the base. Right but it's just kind of the base layer of what we can build here layer of what we can build here. Layer of what we can build here so we announced the project that would so we announced the project that would. So we announced the project that would come to be known as Soroban back in come to be known as Soroban back in. Come to be known as Soroban back in January of last year since then we've January of last year since then we've. January of last year since then we've shared eight I think iterative shared eight I think iterative.

Sorbon should integrate with the existing vanilla Stellar Network existing vanilla Stellar Network. Existing vanilla Stellar Network and while sarban isn't tightly covered and while sarban isn't tightly covered. And while sarban isn't tightly covered coupled to Stellar specifically it is coupled to Stellar specifically it is. Coupled to Stellar specifically it is designed to work well with the network designed to work well with the network.

Rest of the talk rest of the talk rest of the talk so I'll just get started with the. so I'll just get started with the so I'll just get started with the hello world part. Hello world part hello world part    all right so what do we have here. All right so what do we have here all right so what do we have here as Paul mentioned. as Paul mentioned as Paul mentioned I am the founder of usurubond.app which. I am the founder of usurubond.app which I am the founder of usurubond.app which is this tool that you see right here. Is this tool that you see right here is this tool that you see right here it is. it is it is a developer playground for saurabhan a developer playground for saurabhan. A developer playground for saurabhan smart contracts now what do we see on smart contracts now what do we see on. Smart contracts now what do we see on screen exactly well I'm logged in screen exactly well I'm logged in. Screen exactly well I'm logged in so so so I have access to the Gated Alpha here. I have access to the Gated Alpha here I have access to the Gated Alpha here. And I have the ability to create a new and I have the ability to create a new and I have the ability to create a new. Project so let's go ahead and do that project so let's go ahead and do that project so let's go ahead and do that. New project pops up and let's go ahead new project pops up and let's go ahead new project pops up and let's go ahead. And delete everything because we're and delete everything because we're and delete everything because we're. Going to start from scratch going to start from scratch going to start from scratch. What's this environment all about well what's this environment all about well what's this environment all about well. First we have a code Editor to the left first we have a code Editor to the left first we have a code Editor to the left. Here here here this is where we'll just put our rust this is where we'll just put our rust. This is where we'll just put our rust slash sorobong this playground runs slash sorobong this playground runs.

On Rust and the rest soar about SDK you'll as you continue your journey you'll as you continue your journey. You'll as you continue your journey you'll find out that there's other you'll find out that there's other. you'll find out that there's other sdks for sword Bond available sdks for sword Bond available. Sdks for sword Bond available for now we're going to deal with rust for now we're going to deal with rust. For now we're going to deal with rust because that's the sort of reference because that's the sort of reference. Because that's the sort of reference implementation all right so we have the implementation all right so we have the. Implementation all right so we have the code editor we'll we'll put our rest in code editor we'll we'll put our rest in. Code editor we'll we'll put our rest in and sort by and sort by and sort by and then we have some widgets so. and then we have some widgets so and then we have some widgets so right now console is open code is open. Right now console is open code is open right now console is open code is open and let's get started with the hello. And let's get started with the hello and let's get started with the hello world part. World part world part so how do we do that in rest well I so how do we do that in rest well I. So how do we do that in rest well I guess we write a hello function guess we write a hello function. Guess we write a hello function and we call the print line macro and say and we call the print line macro and say. And we call the print line macro and say hello hello hello okay okay okay compile it and that worked this is a. Compile it and that worked this is a compile it and that worked this is a rest program as it should be compiled. Rest program as it should be compiled rest program as it should be compiled and I abstract all the details for. And I abstract all the details for and I abstract all the details for creating cargo projects and. Creating cargo projects and creating cargo projects and the defining targets and so forth so. the defining targets and so forth so the defining targets and so forth so you just sort of write some code and. You just sort of write some code and you just sort of write some code and click compile in you know you're Off to. Click compile in you know you're Off to click compile in you know you're Off to the Races Morgan I'm going to interrupt. The Races Morgan I'm going to interrupt the Races Morgan I'm going to interrupt you for just one second can you zoom in. You for just one second can you zoom in you for just one second can you zoom in a little bit more because we can't see. A little bit more because we can't see a little bit more because we can't see it a little bit more. It a little bit more it a little bit more how about now how about now how about now. A lot more a lot more a lot more a lot more yeah a little bit more I a lot more yeah a little bit more I. A lot more yeah a little bit more I would say yeah would say yeah would say yeah it will be unusable if I zoom in any. It will be unusable if I zoom in any it will be unusable if I zoom in any further so I do apart for anyone. Further so I do apart for anyone further so I do apart for anyone or we can we can hide my face there's a. Or we can we can hide my face there's a or we can we can hide my face there's a lot of stuff on screen that's . Lot of stuff on screen that's lot of stuff on screen that's not the code so we can just sort of. Not the code so we can just sort of not the code so we can just sort of focus on the code here we go. Focus on the code here we go focus on the code here we go there we go there we go. there we go sweeter like I'm almost blind and there sweeter like I'm almost blind and there. Sweeter like I'm almost blind and there you go okay sweet we got one you go okay sweet we got one. You go okay sweet we got one confirmation I can see it fine carry on confirmation I can see it fine carry on. Confirmation I can see it fine carry on and everyone can hide the faces because and everyone can hide the faces because. And everyone can hide the faces because like the vertical space might be useful like the vertical space might be useful. Like the vertical space might be useful nothing but the screen share nothing but the screen share. Nothing but the screen share all right perfect thank you all right perfect thank you. All right perfect thank you all right carrying on so print line all right carrying on so print line. all right carrying on so print line hello didn't work well at least it hello didn't work well at least it. hello didn't work well at least it compiled and didn't produce what we compiled and didn't produce what we. Compiled and didn't produce what we wanted wanted wanted why is the question and. why is the question and why is the question and well we're working in a soybean. Well we're working in a soybean well we're working in a soybean environment right Soroban expects a. Environment right Soroban expects a environment right Soroban expects a certain kind of format for these. Certain kind of format for these certain kind of format for these things to work and everything that. Things to work and everything that things to work and everything that we want to be able to call has to. we want to be able to call has to we want to be able to call has to live in a contract so. Live in a contract so live in a contract so contracts are struck in rest we're. contracts are struck in rest we're contracts are struck in rest we're going to declare a contract struct. Going to declare a contract struct going to declare a contract struct this name can be anything you want. This name can be anything you want this name can be anything you want call contract because it couldn't come. Call contract because it couldn't come call contract because it couldn't come up with a better name. Up with a better name up with a better name all right so we go ahead and Define an. All right so we go ahead and Define an all right so we go ahead and Define an implementation for contract. Implementation for contract implementation for contract let's go ahead and copy this. Let's go ahead and copy this let's go ahead and copy this from here from here from here.  okay okay all right compile this again and that all right compile this again and that. All right compile this again and that worked again no compiler errors but the worked again no compiler errors but the. Worked again no compiler errors but the problem is we still don't see any hellos problem is we still don't see any hellos. Problem is we still don't see any hellos popping up popping up popping up . So that's not great so that's not great so that's not great ideally ideally. Ideally you want to work with the SDK here you want to work with the SDK here you want to work with the SDK here. Because you know a structure like this because you know a structure like this because you know a structure like this. Is not really sort of buying is not really sort of buying is not really sort of buying. we got to tell it to do a little bit we got to tell it to do a little bit we got to tell it to do a little bit. More so for that we're going to use the more so for that we're going to use the more so for that we're going to use the. Soroban SDK Soroban SDK Soroban SDK and we're going to import the contract and we're going to import the contract. And we're going to import the contract implementation macro and that's going to implementation macro and that's going to. Implementation macro and that's going to do do do a bunch of things but essentially this. A bunch of things but essentially this a bunch of things but essentially this will convert this implementation right. Will convert this implementation right will convert this implementation right here into a Soroban contract. Here into a Soroban contract here into a Soroban contract and okay we have a a few errors over. And okay we have a a few errors over and okay we have a a few errors over here. Here here by the way Russ is super famous for by the way Russ is super famous for. by the way Russ is super famous for really good compiler errors and in this really good compiler errors and in this. Really good compiler errors and in this environment which is enabled by Soroban environment which is enabled by Soroban. Environment which is enabled by Soroban the way it's designed to leverage the way it's designed to leverage. The way it's designed to leverage webassembly and webassembly and webassembly and . And rust so we'll get those beautiful and rust so we'll get those beautiful and rust so we'll get those beautiful. Russ compiler errors and we can see that Russ compiler errors and we can see that. Russ compiler errors and we can see that there's some problems with the Panic there's some problems with the Panic. There's some problems with the Panic implementation although it's not implementation although it's not. Implementation although it's not entirely clear what's going on so entirely clear what's going on so. Entirely clear what's going on so I'll just sort of skip the mystery I'll just sort of skip the mystery. I'll just sort of skip the mystery here and here and here and solve this problem by. Solve this problem by solve this problem by finding this macro right here finding this macro right here. Finding this macro right here so contracts on the blockchain have to so contracts on the blockchain have to. So contracts on the blockchain have to be super super efficient in how to use be super super efficient in how to use. Be super super efficient in how to use the available Ledger space and rest the available Ledger space and rest. The available Ledger space and rest programs even though they're pretty programs even though they're pretty. Programs even though they're pretty light they still carry a bunch of stuff light they still carry a bunch of stuff. Light they still carry a bunch of stuff that we don't really need that we don't really need. That we don't really need as part of our contracts so to as part of our contracts so to. as part of our contracts so to eliminate everything that we don't need eliminate everything that we don't need. Eliminate everything that we don't need and just get the rest that you know and just get the rest that you know. and just get the rest that you know the basic rest of that is required for the basic rest of that is required for. The basic rest of that is required for contract logic will we declare contract logic will we declare. Contract logic will we declare the no STD macro the no STD macro the no STD macro. This this this unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately removes the ability for us to use the. removes the ability for us to use the removes the ability for us to use the. Print line macro to print this stuff and print line macro to print this stuff and. Print line macro to print this stuff and okay so let's get rid of that now okay so let's get rid of that now. okay so let's get rid of that now we've back to a solid compiling we've back to a solid compiling. We've back to a solid compiling contract here and let's go ahead and contract here and let's go ahead and. Contract here and let's go ahead and declare this function as a public declare this function as a public. Declare this function as a public function function function now we have something on on on screen up. Now we have something on on on screen up now we have something on on on screen up. Here that's looking like a button here that's looking like a button here that's looking like a button. So in this actions widget which is sort so in this actions widget which is sort so in this actions widget which is sort. Of the of the of the a third of this interface in the middle a third of this interface in the middle. A third of this interface in the middle is where you will be able to click and is where you will be able to click and. Is where you will be able to click and interact with every function that your interact with every function that your. Interact with every function that your contract declares so our contract right contract declares so our contract right. Contract declares so our contract right here declares a single hello function here declares a single hello function. Here declares a single hello function we can call it and we'll see in the we can call it and we'll see in the. We can call it and we'll see in the console a return value console a return value. Console a return value so it's implied that a function without so it's implied that a function without. So it's implied that a function without an explicit return value returns none in an explicit return value returns none in. An explicit return value returns none in rest so same applies here rest so same applies here. Rest so same applies here and we're going to return value now and we're going to return value now. And we're going to return value now I guess we can leverage this return I guess we can leverage this return. I guess we can leverage this return Dynamic to finally say hello to everyone Dynamic to finally say hello to everyone. Dynamic to finally say hello to everyone tuning in tuning in tuning in and for that we will need a special type. And for that we will need a special type and for that we will need a special type. So again since we can't use the rest so again since we can't use the rest so again since we can't use the rest. Strain it's unavailable we have to strain it's unavailable we have to strain it's unavailable we have to. Figure a different way to carry our figure a different way to carry our figure a different way to carry our. Information and for that we're going to information and for that we're going to information and for that we're going to. Use a symbol which is an efficient data use a symbol which is an efficient data use a symbol which is an efficient data. Type type type in in sorobind for storing alphanumeric in in sorobind for storing alphanumeric. In in sorobind for storing alphanumeric characters essentially all the letters characters essentially all the letters. Characters essentially all the letters of the alphabet plus the digits and the of the alphabet plus the digits and the. Of the alphabet plus the digits and the underscore underscore underscore so what we're going to do with symbol is. So what we're going to do with symbol is so what we're going to do with symbol is. We're going to initialize a short symbol we're going to initialize a short symbol. We're going to initialize a short symbol that says hello that says hello that says hello. And short just means that this sequence and short just means that this sequence and short just means that this sequence. Of characters will be able to fit in a of characters will be able to fit in a of characters will be able to fit in a. Single 64-bit value which is pretty single 64-bit value which is pretty single 64-bit value which is pretty. Important important important when it comes to this this context when it comes to this this context. When it comes to this this context let's recompile this again let's recompile this again. Let's recompile this again and oh thank you rust compiler we are and oh thank you rust compiler we are. And oh thank you rust compiler we are returning a value so let's make sure returning a value so let's make sure. Returning a value so let's make sure that we declare what we're returning that we declare what we're returning. That we declare what we're returning and let's call this all right so we have and let's call this all right so we have. And let's call this all right so we have a return value hello a return value hello. A return value hello from this function right here and from this function right here and. from this function right here and this is sort of your basic most basic. This is sort of your basic most basic this is sort of your basic most basic implementation of a sorobind contract. Implementation of a sorobind contract implementation of a sorobind contract that says hello to anyone tuning in. That says hello to anyone tuning in that says hello to anyone tuning in now let's make it a little bit more. Now let's make it a little bit more now let's make it a little bit more spicy spicy. Spicy and let's use a little bit more of the and let's use a little bit more of the. And let's use a little bit more of the environment here so let's say environment here so let's say. Environment here so let's say we're going to log a value everybody we're going to log a value everybody. We're going to log a value everybody loves blogging as a you know someone loves blogging as a you know someone. Loves blogging as a you know someone coming in from a web developer coming in from a web developer. Coming in from a web developer background I use console log all the background I use console log all the. Background I use console log all the time and console log is the best so time and console log is the best so. Time and console log is the best so we have an equivalent in sorobind it's we have an equivalent in sorobind it's. We have an equivalent in sorobind it's called log the log macro and we're going called log the log macro and we're going. Called log the log macro and we're going to declare a new function called hello2 and what are we going to do here we're. And what are we going to do here we're going to going to going to gonna say hello to a specific name it's. Gonna say hello to a specific name it's gonna say hello to a specific name it's going to be a symbol. Going to be a symbol going to be a symbol and we're not going to return anything and we're not going to return anything. And we're not going to return anything okay so how do we interact with this log okay so how do we interact with this log. Okay so how do we interact with this log macro macro macro well it's a macro so we use a bang. well it's a macro so we use a bang well it's a macro so we use a bang and then the first argument is the. And then the first argument is the and then the first argument is the environment within which we're logging. Environment within which we're logging environment within which we're logging this value and you'll get used to. This value and you'll get used to this value and you'll get used to this concept of every single function. This concept of every single function this concept of every single function that your contract has that interacts. That your contract has that interacts that your contract has that interacts with anything else anything in the. With anything else anything in the with anything else anything in the outside world will have to have an. Outside world will have to have an outside world will have to have an environment as the very first argument. Environment as the very first argument environment as the very first argument it's kind of like your access to. It's kind of like your access to it's kind of like your access to everything everything. Everything so log accepts the first argument so log accepts the first argument so log accepts the first argument. being the environment so we're just being the environment so we're just being the environment so we're just. Going to pass in in reference to the going to pass in in reference to the going to pass in in reference to the. Environment next up we have a string environment next up we have a string environment next up we have a string. And we're going to use hello bang and and we're going to use hello bang and and we're going to use hello bang and. Then we're going to provide the name then we're going to provide the name then we're going to provide the name. Let's compile this let's compile this let's compile this oh we're missing environment in in. oh we're missing environment in in oh we're missing environment in in this import and a handy feature is if. This import and a handy feature is if this import and a handy feature is if you're having problems with a specific. You're having problems with a specific you're having problems with a specific type or you're missing something you can. Type or you're missing something you can type or you're missing something you can. Go ahead and click go ahead and click go ahead and click links right inside of your compiler. links right inside of your compiler links right inside of your compiler widget that will take you to the. Widget that will take you to the widget that will take you to the documentation so it's an easy feedback. Documentation so it's an easy feedback documentation so it's an easy feedback loop so now that we've imported an. Loop so now that we've imported an loop so now that we've imported an environment we can recompile this again. Environment we can recompile this again environment we can recompile this again and try saying hello to. And try saying hello to and try saying hello to twitch I guess is where most of you are. Twitch I guess is where most of you are twitch I guess is where most of you are and in this console widget we can see. and in this console widget we can see and in this console widget we can see. That that that in between hello too which is the in between hello too which is the. In between hello too which is the function that we're calling and the function that we're calling and the. Function that we're calling and the return value we have a log that says return value we have a log that says. Return value we have a log that says hello twitch hello twitch hello twitch all right so I'm almost done with the. All right so I'm almost done with the all right so I'm almost done with the first demo anyone and everyone that's. First demo anyone and everyone that's first demo anyone and everyone that's tuning in you can actually test this on. Tuning in you can actually test this on tuning in you can actually test this on your phone. Your phone your phone so this is going to be a multi-modal so this is going to be a multi-modal. so this is going to be a multi-modal demo and for that I'm gonna demo and for that I'm gonna. Demo and for that I'm gonna take my phone here so I just popped up take my phone here so I just popped up. Take my phone here so I just popped up this share modal I'm going to take my this share modal I'm going to take my. This share modal I'm going to take my phone this is an actual phone I have phone this is an actual phone I have.

And I'll go ahead and look at the QR and I'll go ahead and look at the QR code here tap on usurabond.app. Code here tap on usurabond.app code here tap on usurabond.app and we can see we're taken to a version. And we can see we're taken to a version and we can see we're taken to a version of usurubundan app which is mobile. Of usurubundan app which is mobile of usurubundan app which is mobile optimized and you know we gotta work on. Optimized and you know we gotta work on optimized and you know we gotta work on mobile experiences just as much as a. Mobile experiences just as much as a mobile experiences just as much as a desktop experience and someone that's. Desktop experience and someone that's desktop experience and someone that's designing these apps we've got to be. Designing these apps we've got to be designing these apps we've got to be mindful that that's where our audience. Mindful that that's where our audience mindful that that's where our audience is so this kind of interface will allow. Is so this kind of interface will allow is so this kind of interface will allow users to test this contract anywhere. Users to test this contract anywhere users to test this contract anywhere they are especially on the mobile phone. They are especially on the mobile phone they are especially on the mobile phone so we have access to the same sort of. So we have access to the same sort of so we have access to the same sort of widgets we have the console open and. Widgets we have the console open and widgets we have the console open and actions is a sheet down at the bottom we. Actions is a sheet down at the bottom we actions is a sheet down at the bottom we.

Have to worry about that and secondly unlike pretty much any and secondly unlike pretty much any. And secondly unlike pretty much any other smart Contracting platform out other smart Contracting platform out. Other smart Contracting platform out there there there because we're launching on the. because we're launching on the because we're launching on the Stellar Network you get access to all. Stellar Network you get access to all Stellar Network you get access to all the existing assets on the vanilla. The existing assets on the vanilla the existing assets on the vanilla Stellar Network and I want to address a. Stellar Network and I want to address a Stellar Network and I want to address a comment in chat I think from Matthias. Comment in chat I think from Matthias comment in chat I think from Matthias said I should call it classic and not. Said I should call it classic and not said I should call it classic and not vanilla and I'm calling it vanilla for a. Vanilla and I'm calling it vanilla for a vanilla and I'm calling it vanilla for a. Very specific reason right because the very specific reason right because the very specific reason right because the. Existing Stellar network is not going existing Stellar network is not going existing Stellar network is not going. Anywhere anywhere anywhere right that's still all staying there right that's still all staying there. Right that's still all staying there it's not being deprecated it's not a it's not being deprecated it's not a. It's not being deprecated it's not a classic thing right it's just a classic thing right it's just a. Classic thing right it's just a different flavor of the same thing different flavor of the same thing. Different flavor of the same thing it'll still be the fastest cheapest it'll still be the fastest cheapest. it'll still be the fastest cheapest way to use the network but if you way to use the network but if you. Way to use the network but if you need a bit more power that's what need a bit more power that's what. Need a bit more power that's what Soroban's for Soroban's for Soroban's for okay but. Okay but okay but building on the existing Stellar Network building on the existing Stellar Network. Building on the existing Stellar Network means that from day one of launch your means that from day one of launch your. Means that from day one of launch your smart contracts can hold and use usdc smart contracts can hold and use usdc. Smart contracts can hold and use usdc right and many other assets that are right and many other assets that are. Right and many other assets that are already on the network already on the network. Already on the network they also have access to Stellar's cash they also have access to Stellar's cash. They also have access to Stellar's cash on and off ramp via our partnership with on and off ramp via our partnership with. On and off ramp via our partnership with MoneyGram which gives which works in MoneyGram which gives which works in. MoneyGram which gives which works in over 200 countries worldwide right so over 200 countries worldwide right so. Over 200 countries worldwide right so putting this together we could think of putting this together we could think of. Putting this together we could think of someone let's say Julia right she someone let's say Julia right she. Someone let's say Julia right she doesn't have a bank account doesn't have a bank account. Doesn't have a bank account she can go to her local MoneyGram she can go to her local MoneyGram. She can go to her local MoneyGram location deposit cash into the kiosk she location deposit cash into the kiosk she. Location deposit cash into the kiosk she receives usdc on the Stellar Network in receives usdc on the Stellar Network in. Receives usdc on the Stellar Network in her wallet her wallet her wallet and now with Soroban she can take that. And now with Soroban she can take that and now with Soroban she can take that usdc and deposit it into I mean a lot of. Usdc and deposit it into I mean a lot of usdc and deposit it into I mean a lot of. Things right whatever you're building things right whatever you're building things right whatever you're building. But let's say an income generating D5 but let's say an income generating D5 but let's say an income generating D5. Protocol where she receives a portion of protocol where she receives a portion of. Protocol where she receives a portion of transaction fees for providing liquidity. Transaction fees for providing liquidity transaction fees for providing liquidity. Right the partnership between Stellar's right the partnership between Stellar's right the partnership between Stellar's. Anchor Network and MoneyGram allows anchor Network and MoneyGram allows anchor Network and MoneyGram allows. Users like Julia to move cash straight users like Julia to move cash straight users like Julia to move cash straight. From their physical real wallet to a DFI from their physical real wallet to a DFI. From their physical real wallet to a DFI protocol and vice versa which is protocol and vice versa which is. Protocol and vice versa which is something that I don't think's ever been something that I don't think's ever been. Something that I don't think's ever been seen on any other blockchain network so seen on any other blockchain network so. Seen on any other blockchain network so far far far yeah yeah yeah and the third Point here I want to talk. And the third Point here I want to talk and the third Point here I want to talk about what makes Soroban super special. About what makes Soroban super special about what makes Soroban super special is the scaling optimizations that we're. Is the scaling optimizations that we're is the scaling optimizations that we're doing. Doing doing so when designing Soroban we've been able so when designing Soroban we've been able. So when designing Soroban we've been able to learn from the state of the art and to learn from the state of the art and. To learn from the state of the art and hand pick the best solutions from each hand pick the best solutions from each. Hand pick the best solutions from each one one one so we've designed the transaction. So we've designed the transaction so we've designed the transaction execution model the scale across. Execution model the scale across execution model the scale across multiple cores multiple cores. Multiple cores we've calibrated the fee model to we've calibrated the fee model to. We've calibrated the fee model to maximize throughput and minimize cost maximize throughput and minimize cost. Maximize throughput and minimize cost while protecting the existing Stellar while protecting the existing Stellar. While protecting the existing Stellar Network traffic Network traffic Network traffic. So we've designed a lot of optimizations so we've designed a lot of optimizations. So we've designed a lot of optimizations around the contracts themselves as well around the contracts themselves as well. Around the contracts themselves as well that you don't see on every other chain that you don't see on every other chain. That you don't see on every other chain so for example if you look at near so for example if you look at near. So for example if you look at near not to pick on them I love near but they not to pick on them I love near but they. Not to pick on them I love near but they do this in the near contracts you need do this in the near contracts you need. Do this in the near contracts you need to do your own serialization the to do your own serialization the. To do your own serialization the deserialization of arguments when you deserialization of arguments when you. Deserialization of arguments when you get stuff in and out that means you need get stuff in and out that means you need. Get stuff in and out that means you need to compile that into your contract and to compile that into your contract and. To compile that into your contract and deploy it as well right so you need to deploy it as well right so you need to. Deploy it as well right so you need to include that library in Soroban we've include that library in Soroban we've. Include that library in Soroban we've pushed as much as we can out to the host pushed as much as we can out to the host. Pushed as much as we can out to the host environment where we can say batteries environment where we can say batteries. Environment where we can say batteries included right which lets us massively included right which lets us massively. Included right which lets us massively reduce the contract size and you don't reduce the contract size and you don't. Reduce the contract size and you don't need to pay to deploy that code or your need to pay to deploy that code or your. Need to pay to deploy that code or your users don't need to pay to run it right users don't need to pay to run it right. Users don't need to pay to run it right we can take that a little bit further we can take that a little bit further. We can take that a little bit further with built-in contracts so we have an with built-in contracts so we have an. With built-in contracts so we have an idea in Soroban of built-in contracts idea in Soroban of built-in contracts. Idea in Soroban of built-in contracts similar to like pre-compiles you might similar to like pre-compiles you might. Similar to like pre-compiles you might know of us on other network know of us on other network. Know of us on other network So currently this is just for the So currently this is just for the. So currently this is just for the standard asset contract standard asset contract. Standard asset contract and it means that it runs Ultra fast and it means that it runs Ultra fast. and it means that it runs Ultra fast and cheap right and cheap right and cheap right. and it lets and it lets and it lets contract standardize on the interface. Contract standardize on the interface contract standardize on the interface within the ecosystem. Within the ecosystem within the ecosystem and that's the standard asset contract and that's the standard asset contract. And that's the standard asset contract that we have in Soroban is how Stellar that we have in Soroban is how Stellar. That we have in Soroban is how Stellar assets are exposed in Soroban they look assets are exposed in Soroban they look. Assets are exposed in Soroban they look just like any other contract to your just like any other contract to your. Just like any other contract to your contract so it's really easy to contract so it's really easy to. Contract so it's really easy to integrate with existing Stellar assets integrate with existing Stellar assets. Integrate with existing Stellar assets the last thing here that's really the last thing here that's really. the last thing here that's really cool we're actually working on cool we're actually working on. Cool we're actually working on solving State bloat with our state solving State bloat with our state. Solving State bloat with our state expiration model so on other chains you expiration model so on other chains you. Expiration model so on other chains you store some data on chain and it's there store some data on chain and it's there. Store some data on chain and it's there forever right well forever right in air forever right well forever right in air. Forever right well forever right in air quotes we have a rent-based system with quotes we have a rent-based system with. Quotes we have a rent-based system with evictions and Restorations to ensure the evictions and Restorations to ensure the. Evictions and Restorations to ensure the Chain's working data set stays as lean Chain's working data set stays as lean. Chain's working data set stays as lean as possible as possible as possible so so so. Once your rent expires your data gets once your rent expires your data gets once your rent expires your data gets. Evicted and you can pay to have it evicted and you can pay to have it evicted and you can pay to have it. Restored back on chain if you need it we restored back on chain if you need it we. Restored back on chain if you need it we can do a deep dive on that another day can do a deep dive on that another day. Can do a deep dive on that another day it's a bit involved and actually we're it's a bit involved and actually we're. It's a bit involved and actually we're still still designing some of those still still designing some of those. Still still designing some of those elements right now literally right now elements right now literally right now. Elements right now literally right now on the the call on Discord on the the call on Discord. On the the call on Discord so so so at this point I think Morgan can at this point I think Morgan can. at this point I think Morgan can introduce this a bit how stateful introduce this a bit how stateful. Introduce this a bit how stateful contracts work on sarban and get some of contracts work on sarban and get some of. Contracts work on sarban and get some of the basics of those in foreign I'm Paul's back too hey Paul. I'm Paul's back too hey Paul    I am muscle back yeah I am muscle back yeah. I am muscle back yeah we're waiting for we're waiting for we're waiting for my screen share you are waiting for a. my screen share you are waiting for a my screen share you are waiting for a. Screen share of Morgan there you go okay screen share of Morgan there you go okay. Screen share of Morgan there you go okay all right all right all right thank you anyway yeah. thank you anyway yeah thank you anyway yeah thank you Paul so like Paul mentioned . Thank you Paul so like Paul mentioned thank you Paul so like Paul mentioned . There's quite a bit of innovation going there's quite a bit of innovation going there's quite a bit of innovation going. On on on sword I'm and the deeper you go into sword I'm and the deeper you go into. sword I'm and the deeper you go into it the more you can sort of it the more you can sort of. It the more you can sort of understand like you mentioned there's a understand like you mentioned there's a. Understand like you mentioned there's a design discussion going on right now design discussion going on right now. Design discussion going on right now we're about to wrap up we're about to wrap up. We're about to wrap up every week I think they go on but every week I think they go on but. every week I think they go on but anyhow let's discuss the sore month anyhow let's discuss the sore month. Anyhow let's discuss the sore month State of Mind specifically when it comes State of Mind specifically when it comes. State of Mind specifically when it comes to storage and preserving things in to storage and preserving things in. To storage and preserving things in The Ledger The Ledger The Ledger  .  so as I open this up so as I open this up so as I open this up I want to hide my face and then focus on. I want to hide my face and then focus on I want to hide my face and then focus on. The code again if the code again if the code again if    all right perfect so we we're back to. All right perfect so we we're back to all right perfect so we we're back to. A brand new project I think we should a brand new project I think we should. A brand new project I think we should rename this to rename this to rename this to.    speak so we're working on the state on on so we're working on the state on on. The sword State okay the sword State okay the sword State okay so sooner or later every developer finds. So sooner or later every developer finds so sooner or later every developer finds. Themselves in a situation where their themselves in a situation where their themselves in a situation where their. Application is not working as expected I application is not working as expected I. Application is not working as expected I would say raise your hand if that would say raise your hand if that. Would say raise your hand if that happened to you but I can't see you so I happened to you but I can't see you so I. Happened to you but I can't see you so I assume everyone's had this problem assume everyone's had this problem. Assume everyone's had this problem and we all know the techniques of how and we all know the techniques of how. and we all know the techniques of how to solve these things like unit testing to solve these things like unit testing. To solve these things like unit testing or logging intermittent values using or logging intermittent values using. Or logging intermittent values using break points is is a cool way break points is is a cool way. Break points is is a cool way to inspect stack frames and so forth to inspect stack frames and so forth. to inspect stack frames and so forth but unfortunately but unfortunately but unfortunately. Smart contract developers often don't smart contract developers often don't smart contract developers often don't. Have a rapid workflow for finding bugs have a rapid workflow for finding bugs have a rapid workflow for finding bugs. Or faults in the contracts or faults in the contracts or faults in the contracts and you know this leaves them with the. And you know this leaves them with the and you know this leaves them with the only option of hey I want to test. Only option of hey I want to test only option of hey I want to test something out well what do I do I take. Something out well what do I do I take something out well what do I do I take the current code for the contract that I. The current code for the contract that I the current code for the contract that I. Have and I either one of two options I have and I either one of two options I have and I either one of two options I.

Blockchain is is well equipped for developers let's say you can probably developers let's say you can probably. Developers let's say you can probably deploy to a local Docker running deploy to a local Docker running. Deploy to a local Docker running instance instance instance so that's all fine and dandy. So that's all fine and dandy so that's all fine and dandy but but but air is the limit and folks I guess tend. Air is the limit and folks I guess tend air is the limit and folks I guess tend to not test as much as they're used to. To not test as much as they're used to to not test as much as they're used to because of all the hurdles and so Soroban. Because of all the hurdles and so Soroban because of all the hurdles and so Soroban. Takes the challenge hit on by providing takes the challenge hit on by providing takes the challenge hit on by providing. A guest environment right in the SDK so a guest environment right in the SDK so a guest environment right in the SDK so. You'll be able to see in the you'll be able to see in the you'll be able to see in the. Documentation if you follow along this documentation if you follow along this documentation if you follow along this. Path where you read a contract and path where you read a contract and path where you read a contract and. Immediately you read a unit test for a immediately you read a unit test for a immediately you read a unit test for a. Function function function and this is using your regular rust and this is using your regular rust. And this is using your regular rust cargo unit tests cargo unit tests cargo unit tests. with usurubon.app I leverage that with usurubon.app I leverage that with usurubon.app I leverage that. Functionality of the of an environment functionality of the of an environment functionality of the of an environment. provide provide provide features to rapidly test features to rapidly test. Features to rapidly test your contracts your contracts your contracts so right here. So right here so right here we're gonna we're gonna explore we're gonna we're gonna explore. we're gonna we're gonna explore State because let's let's you know face State because let's let's you know face. State because let's let's you know face it if if we're writing hello world it if if we're writing hello world. It if if we're writing hello world probably bugs won't affect anything too probably bugs won't affect anything too. Probably bugs won't affect anything too much if we're dealing with State then much if we're dealing with State then. Much if we're dealing with State then bugs all of a sudden become an issue all bugs all of a sudden become an issue all. Bugs all of a sudden become an issue all right so let's let's begin how do we right so let's let's begin how do we. Right so let's let's begin how do we store something on The Ledger store something on The Ledger. Store something on The Ledger we're gonna head and start with the same we're gonna head and start with the same. We're gonna head and start with the same no STD so we're not going to import the no STD so we're not going to import the. No STD so we're not going to import the standard Library standard Library standard Library. We're going to use the we're going to use the we're going to use the critical elements like contract. Critical elements like contract critical elements like contract implementation and environment Within. Implementation and environment Within implementation and environment Within you know and let's grab a simple as well. You know and let's grab a simple as well you know and let's grab a simple as well. From the SDK and we're going to declare from the SDK and we're going to declare from the SDK and we're going to declare. Another contract another contract another contract    on track okay and then we're going to. On track okay and then we're going to on track okay and then we're going to implement this contract with a couple of. Implement this contract with a couple of implement this contract with a couple of. Functions functions functions    let's clear this let's clear this. let's clear this upper way contract implementation all upper way contract implementation all. Upper way contract implementation all right so what what do we want to test to right so what what do we want to test to. Right so what what do we want to test to sort of showcase this well first let's sort of showcase this well first let's. Sort of showcase this well first let's compile compile often right compile compile often right. Compile compile often right never too often to compile never too often to compile. never too often to compile we're going to have some some data in we're going to have some some data in. We're going to have some some data in the storage and on The Ledger and we're the storage and on The Ledger and we're. The storage and on The Ledger and we're going to save and retrieve that data so going to save and retrieve that data so. Going to save and retrieve that data so we're going to have a couple of we're going to have a couple of. We're going to have a couple of functions so let's declare save as the functions so let's declare save as the. Functions so let's declare save as the one that will put data Into The Ledger one that will put data Into The Ledger. One that will put data Into The Ledger and we're gonna explore a number explore a number. it's gonna be u32 now save is going it's gonna be u32 now save is going it's gonna be u32 now save is going. To return the same number just to return the same number just to return the same number just. For the sake of it I guess and we're for the sake of it I guess and we're for the sake of it I guess and we're. Gonna load gonna load gonna load a number environment environment and it's going to return that number. And it's going to return that number and it's going to return that number so it's essentially save and load two. So it's essentially save and load two so it's essentially save and load two functions for this contract let's. Functions for this contract let's functions for this contract let's compile this again make sure nothing. Compile this again make sure nothing compile this again make sure nothing breaks breaks. Breaks oh okay well I guess I compiled it a oh okay well I guess I compiled it a. oh okay well I guess I compiled it a little too early let's return some little too early let's return some. Little too early let's return some value here value here value here oops. Okay okay so we have we have something of an issue we have something of an issue. I remove this let's make sure this I remove this let's make sure this I remove this let's make sure this. Compiles again compiles again compiles again let me back out of this let me back out of this.  oh oh we don't need to back out of this we're we don't need to back out of this we're. We don't need to back out of this we're just not returning a value before just not returning a value before. Just not returning a value before should have trusted the rest compiler should have trusted the rest compiler. Should have trusted the rest compiler errors all right so we call save it errors all right so we call save it. Errors all right so we call save it takes in a number takes in a number takes in a number. And by the way this is one of those nice and by the way this is one of those nice. And by the way this is one of those nice abstractions that you get with abstractions that you get with. Abstractions that you get with an environment like usurubund.app an environment like usurubund.app. an environment like usurubund.app let's say a function takes in some let's say a function takes in some. Let's say a function takes in some arguments right in this case it takes in arguments right in this case it takes in. Arguments right in this case it takes in a number argument that's a u32 well we a number argument that's a u32 well we. A number argument that's a u32 well we have a nice modal that we can input our have a nice modal that we can input our. Have a nice modal that we can input our number number number to confirm and that's going to call. to confirm and that's going to call to confirm and that's going to call our function. Our function our function as far as integrating into soribine as far as integrating into soribine. As far as integrating into soribine there's another nice feature that's there's another nice feature that's. there's another nice feature that's part of the I guess Soroban contract. Part of the I guess Soroban contract part of the I guess Soroban contract specification so when you compile the. Specification so when you compile the specification so when you compile the contract there's. Contract there's contract there's some amount of that byte code that's some amount of that byte code that's. some amount of that byte code that's compiled allocated for specifications so compiled allocated for specifications so. Compiled allocated for specifications so let's say save something rather save a let's say save something rather save a. Let's say save something rather save a number to The Ledger number to The Ledger number to The Ledger. Okay let's compile this again okay let's compile this again okay let's compile this again. We can see that the modal now we can see that the modal now we can see that the modal now. Incorporates our comment for that incorporates our comment for that incorporates our comment for that. Function to describe what exactly this function to describe what exactly this function to describe what exactly this. Number does or what exactly this number does or what exactly this number does or what exactly this. Function does so we're going to click function does so we're going to click function does so we're going to click. Confirm confirm confirm and let's add a another and let's add a another and let's add a another. Specification here or the docs for this specification here or the docs for this specification here or the docs for this. Function load a number from the layer function load a number from the layer function load a number from the layer. Pile this again pile this again pile this again and oh it doesn't take any arguments. And oh it doesn't take any arguments and oh it doesn't take any arguments it's not going to display that that. It's not going to display that that it's not going to display that that modal that's fine all right let's return. Modal that's fine all right let's return modal that's fine all right let's return. The number the number the number as our first exercise as our first exercise as our first exercise. It's gonna be u32 it's gonna be u32 it's gonna be u32 and and and .   42 42 42 we got 42 in the console here and right we got 42 in the console here and right. We got 42 in the console here and right so now the magic part how do we take the so now the magic part how do we take the. So now the magic part how do we take the number that we provided in our number that we provided in our. Number that we provided in our modal here and put it into storage modal here and put it into storage. Modal here and put it into storage wow wow wow we need a certain key something to. We need a certain key something to we need a certain key something to store it under and for that we're gonna. Store it under and for that we're gonna store it under and for that we're gonna declare a constant. Declare a constant declare a constant and it's going to be a symbol value and it's going to be a symbol value. And it's going to be a symbol value that's why I'm imported symbol and it's that's why I'm imported symbol and it's. That's why I'm imported symbol and it's going to be going to be going to be I'm not original with names under these. I'm not original with names under these I'm not original with names under these circumstances I'm just going to use. Circumstances I'm just going to use circumstances I'm just going to use storage storage. Storage and and and over here we're going to pick the same over here we're going to pick the same. Over here we're going to pick the same environment that we've used before for environment that we've used before for. Environment that we've used before for logging and we're going to reference logging and we're going to reference. Logging and we're going to reference storage okay storage okay storage okay .   compile this compile this compile this oh oh oh about the year I was expecting so. About the year I was expecting so about the year I was expecting so storage is a method not a field as we. Storage is a method not a field as we storage is a method not a field as we can see inside of this error message. Can see inside of this error message can see inside of this error message we can go ahead and inspect what exactly. We can go ahead and inspect what exactly we can go ahead and inspect what exactly. Storage is in the documentation and storage is in the documentation and storage is in the documentation and. let's see exactly how to use it so we let's see exactly how to use it so we. let's see exactly how to use it so we can see that there is a set function can see that there is a set function. Can see that there is a set function under storage it takes a key and a value under storage it takes a key and a value. Under storage it takes a key and a value okay so with this new knowledge here okay so with this new knowledge here. Okay so with this new knowledge here since this is a method not a field since this is a method not a field. since this is a method not a field we're going to call This And since we we're going to call This And since we. We're going to call This And since we observe that it has a public function observe that it has a public function. Observe that it has a public function set we're going to call that set set we're going to call that set. Set we're going to call that set function to store what we're storing function to store what we're storing. Function to store what we're storing so we're going to provide storage as the so we're going to provide storage as the. So we're going to provide storage as the key right key right key right and we're going to provide number. And we're going to provide number and we're going to provide number Something That We're storing or the. Something That We're storing or the Something That We're storing or the value of this so save 42. confirm all right. Of this so save 42. confirm all right how do we know that we did store this how do we know that we did store this. How do we know that we did store this correctly well that's why we have this correctly well that's why we have this. Correctly well that's why we have this load function here load function here load function here. And and and how do we retrieve something right we how do we retrieve something right we. How do we retrieve something right we used set to store it how do we retrieve used set to store it how do we retrieve. Used set to store it how do we retrieve it it it well we can go back to the documentation. Well we can go back to the documentation well we can go back to the documentation. Real quick and see that there is a get real quick and see that there is a get real quick and see that there is a get. Function function function associated with storage and it returns associated with storage and it returns. Associated with storage and it returns an option that's a result that an option that's a result that. An option that's a result that potentially has that value potentially has that value. Potentially has that value so there's so there's so there's you'll see that there's some. you'll see that there's some you'll see that there's some unwrapping that needs to happen. Unwrapping that needs to happen unwrapping that needs to happen oh so we go ahead and reference that. Oh so we go ahead and reference that oh so we go ahead and reference that same storage call that same storage and. Same storage call that same storage and same storage call that same storage and call the get. Call the get call the get method and we want to get the value method and we want to get the value. Method and we want to get the value under storage the the key so what do we under storage the the key so what do we. Under storage the the key so what do we get we get get we get get we get . An error an error an error because we're trying to return a u32 so because we're trying to return a u32 so. Because we're trying to return a u32 so let's return to u32. now we get another let's return to u32. now we get another. Let's return to u32. now we get another area that says we want to have a u32 but we get an. we want to have a u32 but we get an option so whenever we're getting a value option so whenever we're getting a value. Option so whenever we're getting a value from Storage on sorobond any kind of in from Storage on sorobond any kind of in. From Storage on sorobond any kind of in a store buying contract we don't know a store buying contract we don't know. A store buying contract we don't know whether the value is there and we don't whether the value is there and we don't. Whether the value is there and we don't know whether that value is the value know whether that value is the value. Know whether that value is the value that we're going to return in this case that we're going to return in this case. That we're going to return in this case a u32 or it could be a symbol we just a u32 or it could be a symbol we just. A u32 or it could be a symbol we just don't know so we can go ahead and don't know so we can go ahead and. Don't know so we can go ahead and unwrap this unwrap this unwrap this option and see if that works. Option and see if that works option and see if that works well then there's the question of. Well then there's the question of well then there's the question of returning a result so at this point we. Returning a result so at this point we returning a result so at this point we unwrap the option we're sure that. Unwrap the option we're sure that unwrap the option we're sure that there's a value there but we're not sure. There's a value there but we're not sure there's a value there but we're not sure. Whether that value is a u32 value whether that value is a u32 value whether that value is a u32 value. So we can do clever unwrapping here but so we can do clever unwrapping here but so we can do clever unwrapping here but. I'm just going to do a silly unwrapping I'm just going to do a silly unwrapping I'm just going to do a silly unwrapping. So it panics if it's not a u32 and let's so it panics if it's not a u32 and let's. So it panics if it's not a u32 and let's compile this again compile this again compile this again. So let's go ahead and Save so let's go ahead and Save so let's go ahead and Save 111. 111 111 and load okay so we just put a number and load okay so we just put a number. And load okay so we just put a number onto The Ledger under a specific key and onto The Ledger under a specific key and. Onto The Ledger under a specific key and we retrieved that number from The Ledger. We retrieved that number from The Ledger we retrieved that number from The Ledger. We had an experiment with 420 and load we had an experiment with 420 and load we had an experiment with 420 and load. The value do something else it works the value do something else it works the value do something else it works. Okay so there's a complication that I okay so there's a complication that I okay so there's a complication that I. Want to implement here want to implement here want to implement here and it's a little bit different from. And it's a little bit different from and it's a little bit different from what we did during Paris blockchain week. What we did during Paris blockchain week what we did during Paris blockchain week. This is something that tolmer told me this is something that tolmer told me. This is something that tolmer told me to do and so I'm just going to see if to do and so I'm just going to see if. To do and so I'm just going to see if this works if it doesn't well hey this this works if it doesn't well hey this. This works if it doesn't well hey this is a demo these things break is a demo these things break. Is a demo these things break so here's the here's the gist I want to so here's the here's the gist I want to. So here's the here's the gist I want to store a number for a specific account so store a number for a specific account so. Store a number for a specific account so I want to store numbers under accounts I. I want to store numbers under accounts I want to store numbers under accounts I. Just don't want to store a single number just don't want to store a single number. Just don't want to store a single number I want to store it as many numbers as I want to store it as many numbers as I. I want to store it as many numbers as I have accounts have accounts have accounts. So we're going to modify this save so we're going to modify this save so we're going to modify this save. Function here a little bit function here a little bit function here a little bit we're going to take in a user. We're going to take in a user we're going to take in a user argument or parameter that's called. argument or parameter that's called argument or parameter that's called user let's type address so address. User let's type address so address user let's type address so address refers to any valid blocking address on. Refers to any valid blocking address on refers to any valid blocking address on the Stellar blockchain. The Stellar blockchain the Stellar blockchain and then we're going to take in a number. And then we're going to take in a number and then we're going to take in a number. We're going to return the same value we're going to return the same value we're going to return the same value. And let's just see what this does so if and let's just see what this does so if and let's just see what this does so if. If I call Save if I call Save if I call Save I'm greeted with this second field here. I'm greeted with this second field here I'm greeted with this second field here so use oribon you know this modal. So use oribon you know this modal so use oribon you know this modal expands to however many arguments that. Expands to however many arguments that expands to however many arguments that your function takes and there's another. Your function takes and there's another your function takes and there's another cool abstraction here when dealing with. Cool abstraction here when dealing with cool abstraction here when dealing with accounts on the blockchain it can be. Accounts on the blockchain it can be accounts on the blockchain it can be like really tricky for someone just get. Like really tricky for someone just get like really tricky for someone just get getting started right how do I know how. Getting started right how do I know how getting started right how do I know how to generate one do I need the private or. To generate one do I need the private or to generate one do I need the private or. The secret key here the secret key here the secret key here that's a lot for someone that's you. that's a lot for someone that's you that's a lot for someone that's you know into JavaScript or something so for. Know into JavaScript or something so for know into JavaScript or something so for. That reason you saw a line.app that reason you saw a line.app that reason you saw a line.app. Completely abstracts away completely abstracts away completely abstracts away interactions with accounts by using just. Interactions with accounts by using just interactions with accounts by using just. Regular names so how many users does the regular names so how many users does the. Regular names so how many users does the system have it has three users Alex Bart. System have it has three users Alex Bart system have it has three users Alex Bart. And Cali you can select either one and and Cali you can select either one and and Cali you can select either one and. That in the background abstracts it away that in the background abstracts it away. That in the background abstracts it away into a specific address within the back into a specific address within the back. Into a specific address within the back within the current environment which within the current environment which. within the current environment which is running in your browser is running in your browser. Is running in your browser all right so we select Alex one so all right so we select Alex one so. All right so we select Alex one so nothing happened really we just you know nothing happened really we just you know. Nothing happened really we just you know have a a parameter that we're calling have a a parameter that we're calling. Have a a parameter that we're calling this function with but we're not using this function with but we're not using. This function with but we're not using it yet so let's try and use this okay so it yet so let's try and use this okay so. It yet so let's try and use this okay so under storage under storage under storage. Instead of putting everything into the instead of putting everything into the instead of putting everything into the. Same same same key under the same key let's try and key under the same key let's try and. key under the same key let's try and use user okay use user okay use user okay. So let's compile this thing get compiled so let's compile this thing get compiled. So let's compile this thing get compiled and let's call Alex and let's do pen and let's call Alex and let's do pen. And let's call Alex and let's do pen okay okay okay so that sort of kind of worked but how. So that sort of kind of worked but how so that sort of kind of worked but how do we sort of debug this right. Do we sort of debug this right do we sort of debug this right we can we can. We can probably do a log here probably do a log here probably do a log here although. although although maybe we should just use the load maybe we should just use the load. Maybe we should just use the load function okay I'll just do a little function okay I'll just do a little. Function okay I'll just do a little function here so when loading previously function here so when loading previously. Function here so when loading previously we only had one key and we have any we only had one key and we have any. We only had one key and we have any number of keys that number of keys that number of keys that. Correspond to each user so instead of correspond to each user so instead of correspond to each user so instead of. Using storage we're going to use user here's an experiment so let's we saved here's an experiment so let's we saved. I think we saved I think we saved I think we saved let's save 10 under Alex again so let's. Let's save 10 under Alex again so let's let's save 10 under Alex again so let's load Alex. Load Alex load Alex oh we got a 10. so that worked let's try oh we got a 10. so that worked let's try. Oh we got a 10. so that worked let's try Bart Bart Bart it trapped okay so the Trap means that. It trapped okay so the Trap means that it trapped okay so the Trap means that the value doesn't exist but we. the value doesn't exist but we the value doesn't exist but we explicitly tell this thing to unwrap. Explicitly tell this thing to unwrap explicitly tell this thing to unwrap unwrap unwrap. Unwrap unwrap unwrap unwrap not caring about the underlying value not caring about the underlying value. not caring about the underlying value so we can go ahead and sort of so we can go ahead and sort of. So we can go ahead and sort of test this out so here's this log macro test this out so here's this log macro. Test this out so here's this log macro that we used before that we used before that we used before. And and and call this with call this with call this with an arrow just to have some string value. An arrow just to have some string value an arrow just to have some string value in there. In there in there and let's see what that returns   we probably need to do some matching. We probably need to do some matching we probably need to do some matching here here. Here  foreign foreign    type I think I'm going a little over the. Type I think I'm going a little over the type I think I'm going a little over the. The description here but the point being the description here but the point being. The description here but the point being is that we can store values under is that we can store values under . Is that we can store values under whatever key that we want and the key whatever key that we want and the key. Whatever key that we want and the key can be anything in this case I just can be anything in this case I just. Can be anything in this case I just displayed that it can be a specific displayed that it can be a specific. Displayed that it can be a specific address so we'll just go over each user address so we'll just go over each user. Address so we'll just go over each user Alex is going to have 11 Bart is going Alex is going to have 11 Bart is going. Alex is going to have 11 Bart is going to have 22 and Cali is going to have to have 22 and Cali is going to have. To have 22 and Cali is going to have 33. 33. 33. And let's go ahead and check each one so and let's go ahead and check each one so. And let's go ahead and check each one so Alex 11. okay Cali 33 and Bart is 22. so. Alex 11. okay Cali 33 and Bart is 22. so Alex 11. okay Cali 33 and Bart is 22. so. This is much more elegant than what we this is much more elegant than what we this is much more elegant than what we. Had during Pierce blockchain week had during Pierce blockchain week had during Pierce blockchain week. Were you storing values under were you storing values under were you storing values under . Specific usernames thank you Tomer for specific usernames thank you Tomer for specific usernames thank you Tomer for. This suggestion this suggestion this suggestion and sort of the nice deviation. and sort of the nice deviation and sort of the nice deviation from the from the standard here. From the from the standard here from the from the standard here all right so that concludes my second. all right so that concludes my second all right so that concludes my second. Demo for the Soroban state of mind if demo for the Soroban state of mind if. Demo for the Soroban state of mind if anyone wants to again experiment with anyone wants to again experiment with. Anyone wants to again experiment with this please tweet me on Twitter at this please tweet me on Twitter at. This please tweet me on Twitter at soribandev and I'll make sure you have soribandev and I'll make sure you have. Soribandev and I'll make sure you have access access access thank you so much Morgan Tyler yeah let. Thank you so much Morgan Tyler yeah let thank you so much Morgan Tyler yeah let me bring Tyler onto stream howdy Tyler. Me bring Tyler onto stream howdy Tyler me bring Tyler onto stream howdy Tyler how are you hello. How are you hello how are you hello all right let's bring up your screen all right let's bring up your screen. All right let's bring up your screen here and nice tell us all about the 100 here and nice tell us all about the 100. Here and nice tell us all about the 100 million dollars two opportunities sounds million dollars two opportunities sounds. Million dollars two opportunities sounds very interesting so I'll let you take it. Very interesting so I'll let you take it very interesting so I'll let you take it. Off yeah don't let me talk about much off yeah don't let me talk about much off yeah don't let me talk about much. They do let me talk about the money they do let me talk about the money they do let me talk about the money. so we've got so we've got so we've got basically two main opportunities here. Basically two main opportunities here basically two main opportunities here for engaging with Soroban right now so. For engaging with Soroban right now so for engaging with Soroban right now so we're we're in this phase between.

I remember I was 14 when I wrote my first line of code my first line of code. My first line of code and for me that was you know that and for me that was you know that. And for me that was you know that experience informed what I was going to experience informed what I was going to. Experience informed what I was going to do from that point onward and I've made do from that point onward and I've made. Do from that point onward and I've made a career out of it in almost 20 years of a career out of it in almost 20 years of. A career out of it in almost 20 years of frustration frustration frustration followed with the joy of seeing. Followed with the joy of seeing followed with the joy of seeing something that you build come to life. Something that you build come to life something that you build come to life. So that's I guess any developers Journey so that's I guess any developers Journey. So that's I guess any developers Journey there there there and the reason I'm sharing the the. And the reason I'm sharing the the and the reason I'm sharing the the frustration with the joy part is because. Frustration with the joy part is because frustration with the joy part is because. I feel this industry and I'm talking I feel this industry and I'm talking I feel this industry and I'm talking.

Experience there's a lot experience there's a lot experience there's a lot so over the last two years I've tried. So over the last two years I've tried so over the last two years I've tried playing around with a few smart contract. Playing around with a few smart contract playing around with a few smart contract. platforms platforms platforms spending considerable amount of time spending considerable amount of time. Spending considerable amount of time with two of them and in the end I with two of them and in the end I. With two of them and in the end I felt a little bit like Dorothy from The felt a little bit like Dorothy from The. Felt a little bit like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz in a conversation with Wizard of Oz in a conversation with. Wizard of Oz in a conversation with Scarecrow and Tin Man trying to find out Scarecrow and Tin Man trying to find out. Scarecrow and Tin Man trying to find out why one had no brain and the other one why one had no brain and the other one. Why one had no brain and the other one had no heart had no heart had no heart and in my frustration I continued. And in my frustration I continued and in my frustration I continued looking looking. Looking for a platform that had both a heart and for a platform that had both a heart and. For a platform that had both a heart and a brain a brain a brain and just last November I found Soroban. And just last November I found Soroban and just last November I found Soroban the first sore bonathon was taking place. The first sore bonathon was taking place the first sore bonathon was taking place. And anuhe was hosting that and it was a and anuhe was hosting that and it was a and anuhe was hosting that and it was a. Beautiful experience on GitHub you log beautiful experience on GitHub you log beautiful experience on GitHub you log.

And and thoughts and experiencing the and and thoughts and experiencing the and and thoughts and experiencing the. Joy of of development technology and joy of of development technology and joy of of development technology and. Right yeah so I took part in that right yeah so I took part in that right yeah so I took part in that. I've jumped right on it I've jumped right on it I've jumped right on it and I found out about Soroban in the. and I found out about Soroban in the and I found out about Soroban in the process I found out about xdr which is. Process I found out about xdr which is process I found out about xdr which is the data format for storing things on. The data format for storing things on the data format for storing things on Stellar. Stellar Stellar that Soroban uses and then I started that Soroban uses and then I started. That Soroban uses and then I started getting into rust and getting into rust and getting into rust and. it's a long journey and doing so it's a long journey and doing so it's a long journey and doing so. Without prior experience mind you without prior experience mind you without prior experience mind you. And then lastly was webassembly the and then lastly was webassembly the and then lastly was webassembly the. One of the key building blocks of of one of the key building blocks of of one of the key building blocks of of. Soroban Soroban Soroban and my first projects were very simple and my first projects were very simple. And my first projects were very simple mostly to do with optimizations of the mostly to do with optimizations of the. Mostly to do with optimizations of the development workflow development workflow development workflow. one workflow or another and I made one workflow or another and I made one workflow or another and I made. Some submissions along those lines I some submissions along those lines I some submissions along those lines I. Think it was five in total yeah there think it was five in total yeah there think it was five in total yeah there. Were a lot of them actually you were one were a lot of them actually you were one. Were a lot of them actually you were one of our Superstar submitters to of our Superstar submitters to. Of our Superstar submitters to silverwater thought if I recall yeah silverwater thought if I recall yeah. Silverwater thought if I recall yeah and and it was a blast and and the and and it was a blast and and the. and and it was a blast and and the community on Discord was great in the community on Discord was great in the. Community on Discord was great in the community on GitHub was great people community on GitHub was great people. Community on GitHub was great people were commenting and so forth were commenting and so forth. Were commenting and so forth so that was a really soft and nice so that was a really soft and nice. so that was a really soft and nice nice introduction to to sort of buying nice introduction to to sort of buying. Nice introduction to to sort of buying and my final project and my final project and my final project. As part of sorbineathon I think I as part of sorbineathon I think I as part of sorbineathon I think I. Submitted it last day submitted it last day submitted it last day was a browser tool for interacting. was a browser tool for interacting was a browser tool for interacting with the Soroban RPC server something. With the Soroban RPC server something with the Soroban RPC server something that a lot of folks do when interacting. That a lot of folks do when interacting that a lot of folks do when interacting with any kind of blockchain. With any kind of blockchain with any kind of blockchain you don't go directly to a node. you don't go directly to a node you don't go directly to a node you're running you go to an RPC server. You're running you go to an RPC server you're running you go to an RPC server for y'all remote procedure call. for y'all remote procedure call for y'all remote procedure call server I remember the https from. Server I remember the https from server I remember the https from Bloomberg Bloomberg. Bloomberg gotta spell it out so the RPC server gotta spell it out so the RPC server. gotta spell it out so the RPC server thing I wanted to build a great thing I wanted to build a great. Thing I wanted to build a great developer experience for anyone building developer experience for anyone building. Developer experience for anyone building and testing their contracts because and testing their contracts because. And testing their contracts because deploying the contract deploying the contract. Deploying the contract invoking the contract is often tricky if invoking the contract is often tricky if. Invoking the contract is often tricky if you want to do it with arguments and you want to do it with arguments and. You want to do it with arguments and stuff and especially if you're sort of stuff and especially if you're sort of. Stuff and especially if you're sort of coming in from a command line coming in from a command line. Coming in from a command line and in doing that I spent countless and in doing that I spent countless. And in doing that I spent countless hours working on various parts of the hours working on various parts of the. Hours working on various parts of the stack from the wasm executable to the stack from the wasm executable to the. Stack from the wasm executable to the host environment and then it hit me I host environment and then it hit me I. Host environment and then it hit me I realized something realized something realized something. I had everything I needed to build a I had everything I needed to build a I had everything I needed to build a.
