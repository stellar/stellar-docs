Know I at first I really started with
Know I at first I really started with
Know I at first I really started with
some I I did not have like a a concrete
some I I did not have like a a concrete
some I I did not have like a a concrete
idea I wanted. I I had some some toy
idea I wanted. I I had some some toy
idea I wanted. I I had some some toy
problem that I had in my in my head that
problem that I had in my in my head that
problem that I had in my in my head that
I wanted to to do. Um maybe some people
I wanted to to do. Um maybe some people
I wanted to to do. Um maybe some people
in the audience also saw saw some some
in the audience also saw saw some some
in the audience also saw saw some some
of these. I had an idea with a I had a
of these. I had an idea with a I had a
of these. I had an idea with a I had a
Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build um
Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build um
Raspberry Pi and I wanted to to build um
like um a gimmified platform where you
like um a gimmified platform where you
like um a gimmified platform where you
actually you have a a pump and you use
actually you have a a pump and you use
actually you have a a pump and you use
the you pump and as much as you pump if
the you pump and as much as you pump if
the you pump and as much as you pump if
you pass a threshold and it's going to
you pass a threshold and it's going to
you pass a threshold and it's going to
to do a trigger and and to send some
to do a trigger and and to send some
to do a trigger and and to send some
tokens. So I had something like that um
tokens. So I had something like that um
tokens. So I had something like that um
that I hacked away. That was my first
that I hacked away. That was my first
that I hacked away. That was my first
contract actually and um um yeah that's
contract actually and um um yeah that's
contract actually and um um yeah that's
that's what I built first and I even
that's what I built first and I even
that's what I built first and I even
made a YouTube video about it. Um and so
made a YouTube video about it. Um and so
made a YouTube video about it. Um and so
yeah, I I did one idea like that and and
yeah, I I did one idea like that and and
yeah, I I did one idea like that and and
the second one that I did was I wanted
the second one that I did was I wanted
the second one that I did was I wanted
to explore around the tokenization of
to explore around the tokenization of
to explore around the tokenization of
things and make a make a a token and but
things and make a make a a token and but
things and make a make a a token and but
push a bit further. And so there I was
push a bit further. And so there I was
push a bit further. And so there I was
okay I had this idea of looking at um
okay I had this idea of looking at um
okay I had this idea of looking at um
live data so weather data and so I was
live data so weather data and so I was
live data so weather data and so I was
looking at the the expansion of the ice
looking at the the expansion of the ice
looking at the the expansion of the ice
and the contraction of the ice in the
and the contraction of the ice in the
and the contraction of the ice in the
Arctic. And I was like, okay, I'm going
Arctic. And I was like, okay, I'm going
Arctic. And I was like, okay, I'm going
to put that data and use that data to
to put that data and use that data to
to put that data and use that data to
either mint or burn a token. And so I
either mint or burn a token. And so I
either mint or burn a token. And so I
had sort of an oracle in mind. And um so
had sort of an oracle in mind. And um so
had sort of an oracle in mind. And um so
I built another project like that. And
I built another project like that. And
I built another project like that. And
building these two project uh gave me
building these two project uh gave me
building these two project uh gave me
some confidence into building smart
some confidence into building smart
some confidence into building smart

Um, yeah. And so here uh the the main
Um, yeah. And so here uh the the main
Um, yeah. And so here uh the the main
information that you have and the
information that you have and the
information that you have and the
information which is actually stored on
information which is actually stored on
information which is actually stored on
chain um is this thing the the last
chain um is this thing the the last

hash. Uh so yeah here you see I have a
hash. Uh so yeah here you see I have a
hash. Uh so yeah here you see I have a
bug apparently because you don't see the
bug apparently because you don't see the
bug apparently because you don't see the
hash but you you see it um um you see it
hash but you you see it um um you see it
hash but you you see it um um you see it
here being being represented. So you
here being being represented. So you
here being being represented. So you
have all the hashes here uh and you can
have all the hashes here uh and you can
have all the hashes here uh and you can
actually go onchain and see the the
actually go onchain and see the the
actually go onchain and see the the
project itself. So let me just quickly
project itself. So let me just quickly
project itself. So let me just quickly
go there.
So here's the contract itself and every
So here's the contract itself and every
time you do something yeah you would see
time you do something yeah you would see
time you do something yeah you would see
it see it here and here are all the
it see it here and here are all the
it see it here and here are all the

here here's the the project defined so
here here's the the project defined so
here here's the the project defined so
here is saliv but had tonsu yeah here's

here is saliv but had tonsu yeah here's
the project how it's defined so that's
the project how it's defined so that's
the project how it's defined so that's
that's basically the information store
that's basically the information store
that's basically the information store
on chain I saw the project name some

some other metadata associated to that
some other metadata associated to that
some other metadata associated to that
and the the main metadata right now is
and the the main metadata right now is

GitHub which is a commit hash. So this
GitHub which is a commit hash. So this
GitHub which is a commit hash. So this
is uh this store in in another entry. So

some indication here of what's on chain
some indication here of what's on chain
some indication here of what's on chain
and and to be able to verify that. So

this data as I just shown before is
this data as I just shown before is
this data as I just shown before is
stored on IPFS. So what you just saw
stored on IPFS. So what you just saw

that's the proposal itself. When you

create a proposal you can put an image,
create a proposal you can put an image,
create a proposal you can put an image,
you can put whatever you want. I have
you can put whatever you want. I have

one concept I have on the on the D
one concept I have on the on the D
one concept I have on the on the D
itself, it's pretty surprised. Yes. One
itself, it's pretty surprised. Yes. One
itself, it's pretty surprised. Yes. One
concept I have with the the DA proposal
concept I have with the the DA proposal
concept I have with the the DA proposal
is that I have the concept of outcome.
is that I have the concept of outcome.
is that I have the concept of outcome.
And so when a proposal is accepted um it
And so when a proposal is accepted um it
And so when a proposal is accepted um it
can execute when when you're going to
can execute when when you're going to
can execute when when you're going to
execute the proposal itself and to to
execute the proposal itself and to to
execute the proposal itself and to to
have the the tally being calculated
have the the tally being calculated
have the the tally being calculated
you're actually going to be able to say
you're actually going to be able to say
you're actually going to be able to say
okay if it's approved please execute
okay if it's approved please execute
okay if it's approved please execute
that transaction and so uh here you have
that transaction and so uh here you have
that transaction and so uh here you have
an example of of ex that I put so here
an example of of ex that I put so here
an example of of ex that I put so here
in this it's a trivial example that I
in this it's a trivial example that I
in this it's a trivial example that I
put here but you can put any any when
put here but you can put any any when
put here but you can put any any when
you create a proposal and so if the when
you create a proposal and so if the when
you create a proposal and so if the when
you execute a proposal You're going to
you execute a proposal You're going to
you execute a proposal You're going to
have like a screen telling you this is
have like a screen telling you this is
have like a screen telling you this is
going to be executed when you actually
going to be executed when you actually
going to be executed when you actually
execute the proposal. And so the the
execute the proposal. And so the the
execute the proposal. And so the the
ting is going to be made and this is
ting is going to be made and this is
ting is going to be made and this is
going to be also also sent. So what what
going to be also also sent. So what what
going to be also also sent. So what what
can you use that for? You can use this
can you use that for? You can use this
can you use that for? You can use this
for instance to add a m not just to pay
for instance to add a m not just to pay
for instance to add a m not just to pay
people but to me it was to do some
people but to me it was to do some
people but to me it was to do some
special action for maintainers. For
special action for maintainers. For
special action for maintainers. For
instance, if you wanted to change the
instance, if you wanted to change the
instance, if you wanted to change the
structure of your governance, you can
structure of your governance, you can
structure of your governance, you can
say you can have a proposal saying, "Oh,
say you can have a proposal saying, "Oh,
say you can have a proposal saying, "Oh,
yeah, what about we add um I don't know
yeah, what about we add um I don't know
yeah, what about we add um I don't know
pumpfield to to this other community."
pumpfield to to this other community."
pumpfield to to this other community."
And so you will make a proposal and the
And so you will make a proposal and the
And so you will make a proposal and the
uh the XDR itself would just be to call
uh the XDR itself would just be to call
uh the XDR itself would just be to call
the tanu contract itself and to add
the tanu contract itself and to add
the tanu contract itself and to add
myself to another project and people
myself to another project and people
myself to another project and people
when they vote and when you execute that
when they vote and when you execute that
when they vote and when you execute that
then I would be able to be added
then I would be able to be added
then I would be able to be added
automatically um into the into that new
automatically um into the into that new
automatically um into the into that new
organization. So this way you can really

manage your um the the whole governance
manage your um the the whole governance
manage your um the the whole governance
of your project on chain as well or the

also you can yeah have font
also you can yeah have font
also you can yeah have font
distributions and all of that. And what
distributions and all of that. And what
distributions and all of that. And what
I want to to do afterwards is so right
I want to to do afterwards is so right
I want to to do afterwards is so right
now it's very manual. You have to uh
now it's very manual. You have to uh
now it's very manual. You have to uh
create your own XDR and paste it there.
create your own XDR and paste it there.
create your own XDR and paste it there.
But what I want to have is templates
But what I want to have is templates
But what I want to have is templates
that people can use and they will be
that people can use and they will be
that people can use and they will be
able to to have like I don't know a drop
able to to have like I don't know a drop
able to to have like I don't know a drop
down and then select yeah I want to add
down and then select yeah I want to add

have a few fields to fill and boom it
have a few fields to fill and boom it
have a few fields to fill and boom it
will just pre build the easier for you.
