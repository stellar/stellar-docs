yeah so what's the the problem that we
yeah so what's the the problem that we
yeah so what's the the problem that we
are facing is that in Latin America
are facing is that in Latin America
are facing is that in Latin America
there are a lot of infrastructure
there are a lot of infrastructure
there are a lot of infrastructure
operators that are lacking fund and they
operators that are lacking fund and they
operators that are lacking fund and they
struggle to to scale because on
struggle to to scale because on

traditional banking systems the they
traditional banking systems the they
traditional banking systems the they
require to go to to ask to the bank to
require to go to to ask to the bank to
require to go to to ask to the bank to
then request for a loan then go through
then request for a loan then go through
then request for a loan then go through
all the bureaucracy of the bank. Uh but
all the bureaucracy of the bank. Uh but
all the bureaucracy of the bank. Uh but
uh then also time moves and they need
uh then also time moves and they need
uh then also time moves and they need
the the money to deploy and to uh create
the the money to deploy and to uh create
the the money to deploy and to uh create
this new infrastructure that is not
this new infrastructure that is not
this new infrastructure that is not
risky by itself but maybe the banks
risky by itself but maybe the banks
risky by itself but maybe the banks
consider is risky because of the type of
consider is risky because of the type of
consider is risky because of the type of
size of the company maybe or the type of

that the business business itself of
that the business business itself of
that the business business itself of
that infrastructure is um non um
that infrastructure is um non um
that infrastructure is um non um
investable or that it will give money uh

So as I was saying uh let's imagine that
So as I was saying uh let's imagine that
So as I was saying uh let's imagine that
you are Mariano you are trying to get a
you are Mariano you are trying to get a
you are Mariano you are trying to get a
traditional credit a loan for for a
traditional credit a loan for for a
traditional credit a loan for for a
bank. uh but this uh depending on the
bank. uh but this uh depending on the
bank. uh but this uh depending on the
country also for example we've recently
country also for example we've recently
country also for example we've recently
seen in Argentina how this uh country
seen in Argentina how this uh country
seen in Argentina how this uh country
was facing high inflation rates or
was facing high inflation rates or
was facing high inflation rates or
similar situation with Venezuela
similar situation with Venezuela
similar situation with Venezuela
and other countries in Latin America
and other countries in Latin America
and other countries in Latin America
with high inflation rates that then uh
with high inflation rates that then uh
with high inflation rates that then uh
this ties those loans to higher interest
this ties those loans to higher interest
this ties those loans to higher interest
rates plus the the risk on the country
rates plus the the risk on the country
rates plus the the risk on the country
itself.

Uh so uh there's this problem of banks
Uh so uh there's this problem of banks
Uh so uh there's this problem of banks
uh because of these situations not uh
uh because of these situations not uh
uh because of these situations not uh
giving beneficial loans to

at the same time uh if the
at the same time uh if the
at the same time uh if the
infrastructure operator would uh go for

okay um let's get all of these people
okay um let's get all of these people
okay um let's get all of these people
request this this uh this amount of
