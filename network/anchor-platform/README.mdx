The Anchor Platform is a set of tools and APIs that enable developers and businesses to build their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network. It provides a standardized interface, including the implementation of several Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), to make it easy for businesses to integrate with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.

The platform also includes features for managing assets, transactions, and user accounts, and supports a variety of deployment options, including using Docker or Kubernetes. Overall, the Anchor Platform aims to simplify the process of building and managing a Stellar-based financial service, allowing businesses to focus on providing value to their customers.

Learn about integrating with the Anchor Platform in the [Admin Guide](./admin-guide/README.mdx) or get API information in the [API Reference](./api-reference/README.mdx).
