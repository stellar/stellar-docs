Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string        |                                                                                                                                 |              |              |                             | Yes       |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| batch_run_date                       | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger.   | datetime      |                                                                                                                                 |              |              | MONTH partition             | Yes       | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost.                                           |
| batch_insert_ts                      | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database.
