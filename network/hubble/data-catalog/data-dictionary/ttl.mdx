| last_modified_ledger  | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry (this unique signer for the account) was modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number            | integer   |               |              | Yes          | Cluster                     | Yes       |       |
| ledger_entry_change   | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry.                                                                                                                         | integer   |               |              |              |                             | Yes       |       |
| deleted               | Indicates whether the ledger entry (balance id) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered.                                                                                     | boolean   |               |              |              |                             | Yes       |       |
| batch_id              | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>".

| batch_run_date        | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger.   | datetime  |               |              |              |                             | Yes       |       |
| batch_insert_ts       | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill                                            | timestamp |               |              |              |                             | Yes       |       |

| ledger_sequence       | The unsigned 32-bit ledger number of the sequence number's age                                                                                                                                                 | integer   |               |              | Yes          |                             | Yes       |       |
