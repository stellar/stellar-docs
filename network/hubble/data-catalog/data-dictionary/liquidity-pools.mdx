| liquidity_pool_id    | Unique identifier for a liquidity pool. There cannot be duplicate pools for the same asset pair. Once a pool has been created for the asset pair, another cannot be created.                                                         | string    |                                                                                                                                 |              | Yes          | cluster                     | Yes       | There is a good primer on AMMs [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/liquidity-pool/)                                                                                                                                                                          |
| type                 | The mechanism that calculates pricing and division of shares for the pool.

| trustline_count      | Total number of accounts with trustlines authorized to the pool. To create a trustline, an account must trust both base assets before trusting a pool with the asset pair                                                            | integer   |                                                                                                                                 |              |              |                             | Yes       | If the issuer of A or B revokes authorization on the trustline, the account will automatically withdraw from every liquidity pool containing that asset and those pool trustlines will be deleted.                                                                           |
| pool_share_count     | Participation in a liquidity pool is represented by a pool share.

Conversely, decreasing pools shares can only be accomplished through a withdraw operation. Shares cannot be sent in payments or sold using offers. |
