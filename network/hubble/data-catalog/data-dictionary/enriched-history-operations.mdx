| path                              | Path payments maximize the best exchange rate path when sending money from one asset to another asset.

Example: sending EUR -> MXN could look like EUR -> BTC -> CNY -> XLM -> MXN to maximize the best exchange rate Payments are atomic, so if an exchange in the middle of a path payment fails, the entire payment will fail which means the user will keep their original funds. They will not be stuck with an intermediary asset in the event of payment failure.       |
