| id              | Unique identifier for the asset code, type and issuer combination. This is not a primary key on the table                                                                                                      | float     |                                                 |              | Yes          |                             | Yes       |                                                                                                                                                         |
| asset_type      | The identifier for type of asset code, can be a alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM.                                                                         | string    | credit_alphanum4 credit_alphanum12 native       |              | Yes          | cluster                     | Yes       | XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native'     |
| asset_code      | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network                                                                                                                                          | string    |                                                 |              | Yes          | cluster                     | No        | Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset                                |
| asset_issuer    | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset                                                                                                                                        | string    |                                                 |              | Yes          | cluster                     | No        |                                                                                                                                                         |
| batch_id        | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string    |                                                 |              | Yes          |                             | Yes       |                                                                                                                                                         |
| batch_run_date  | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger.   | datetime  |                                                 |              |              | MONTH partition             | Yes       | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill                                            | timestamp |                                                 |              |              |                             | Yes       |                                                                                                                                                         |
| asset_id        | Unique identifier for asset_code, asset_issuer                                                                                                                                                                 | integer   |                                                 |              |              |                             | No        |                                                                                                                                                         |
