| batch_id                     | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities                                           | string    |                                                |              |              |                             | Yes       |                                                                                                                                                                  |
| batch_run_date               | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger.                                             | datetime  |                                                |              |              |                             | Yes       | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost.          |
| batch_insert_ts              | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill                                                                                      | timestamp |                                                |              |              |                             | Yes       |                                                                                                                                                                  |
