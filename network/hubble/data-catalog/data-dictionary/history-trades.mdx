| rounding_slippage         | Applies to liquidity pool trades only. With fractional amounts of an asset traded, the network must round a fraction to the nearest whole number. This can cause the trade to "slip" price by a percentage compared with the original offer. Rounding slippage reports the percentage that dust trades slip before executing. | integer   |                                                              |              |              |                             | No        | Defaults to 1  Rounding Slippage is always unprofitable for the trader and is not a valid way to try and extract more value from the network.           |
| seller_is_exact           | Indicates whether the buying or selling party trade was impacted by rounding slippage. If true, the buyer was impacted.
