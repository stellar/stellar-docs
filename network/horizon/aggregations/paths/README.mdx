Paths provide information about potential path payments. A path can be used to populate the necessary fields for a path payment operation.

Learn more about the two types of path payment: [`path payment strict send`](/docs/learn/fundamentals/list-of-operations#path-payment-strict-send) and [`path payment strict receive`](/docs/learn/fundamentals/list-of-operations#path-payment-strict-receive)
