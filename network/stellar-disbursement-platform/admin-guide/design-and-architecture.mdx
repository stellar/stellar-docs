The Stellar Disbursement Platform consists of four services deployed together:

- **Dashboard**: the user interface administrators use to initiate and track the progress of disbursements
- **SDP Core Service**: the core backend service that performs several functions:
  - **Dashboard API**: the API used by the front-end UI for all disbursement requests. The API is documented [here](../api-reference/resources/README.mdx)
  - **Messaging Service**: a recurring process that sends text messages to users prompting them to download the wallet selected for a particular disbursement and verify their phone with an OTP
  - **Wallet Registration UI**: a web application that collects and verifies the recipient’s OTP code and verification information via Stellar’s [SEP-24: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md) protocol
- **Anchor Platform Service**: the API server that the wallet uses to authenticate and initiate the recipient’s registration process through the SEP-24 deposit flow
- **Transaction Submission Service**: the service that submits all payment transactions to the Stellar network. This service is designed to maximize payment throughput, handle queuing, and graceful resubmission/error handling

## Dependencies {#dependencies}

- **Container Orchestration**: the SDP is packaged as Docker containers and can be deployed to Kubernetes or AWS Fargate. SDF provides a Helm Chart for Kubernetes
- **Postgres**: the SDP uses a Postgres database server for all of its services
- **Twilio or AWS SNS and SES**: the SDP’s messaging service uses SMS messages via Twilio or AWS SNS and administrative emails for organization account setup and recovery via AWS SES
- **Stellar Accounts**:
  - Distribution Account: the SDP requires access to a funded Stellar account to make payments to the recipient
  - SEP-10 Auth Account: the SDP requires a Stellar account for the mutual authentication protocol [SEP-10: Stellar Web Authentication](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md) used to connect to wallet applications
