## Starting Your Node

Once you've [set up your environment](./prerequisites.mdx), [configured your node](./configuring.mdx), set up your [quorum set](./configuring.mdx#choosing-your-quorum-set), and selected archives to `get` [history from](./environment-preparation.mdx#history), you're ready to start Stellar Core.

Use a command equivalent to:

```bash
stellar-core run
```

At this point, you're ready to observe your core node's activity as it joins the network.

You may want to skip ahead and review the [Logging](./logging.mdx) page to familiarize yourself with Stellar Core's output.

## Interacting With Your Instance

When your node is running, you can interact with Stellar Core via an administrative HTTP endpoint. Commands can be issued using command-line HTTP tools such as `curl`, or by running a command such as

```bash
stellar-core http-command <http-command>
```

The HTTP endpoint is [not intended to be exposed to the public internet](./prerequisites.mdx#internal-system-access). It's typically accessed by administrators, or by a mid-tier application to submit transactions to the Stellar network.

See [commands](./commands.mdx) for a description of the available commands.

## Joining the Network

Your node will go through the following phases as it joins the network:

### Establish Connection to Other Peers.

You should see `authenticated_count` increase.

```json
"peers" : {
  "authenticated_count" : 3,
  "pending_count" : 4
},
```

### Observing Consensus

Until the node sees a quorum, it will say:

```json
"state" : "Joining SCP"
```

After observing consensus, a new field `quorum` will display information about network decisions. At this point the node will switch to a "_Catching up_" state:

```json
"quorum" : {
  "qset" : {
    "ledger" : 22267866,
    "cost" : 20883268,
    "agree" : 5,
    "delayed" : 0,
    "disagree" : 0,
    "fail_at" : 3,
    "hash" : "980a24",
    "lag_ms" : 430,
    "missing" : 0,
    "phase" : "EXTERNALIZE"
  },
  "transitive" : {
    "intersection" : true,
    "last_check_ledger" : 22267866,
    "node_count" : 21
  }
},
"state" : "Catching up",
```

### Catching up

This is a phase where the node downloads data from any configured archives. This phase begins with something like:

```json
"state" : "Catching up",
"status" : [ "Catching up: Awaiting checkpoint (ETA: 35 seconds)" ]
```

And will then move through the various phases of downloading and applying state, such as:

```json
"state" : "Catching up",
"status" : [ "Catching up: downloading ledger files 20094/119803 (16%)" ]
```

You can specify how far back in time your node goes to catch up in your config file. If you set the `CATCHUP_COMPLETE` field to `true`, your node will replay the _entire history_ of the network, which can take a long time. Weeks. You can speed up the process by copying existing archives from another full validator, but you only need to replay the complete network history if you're setting up a Full Validator (or possibly if you need to reingest Horizon state). Otherwise, you can specify a starting point for catchup using the `CATCHUP_RECENT` field. See the [complete example configuration] for more details.

:::info

The `CATCHUP_COMPLETE` and `CATCHUP_RECENT` config fields are mutually exclusive. If the `CATCHUP_COMPLETE` field is set to `true`, the `CATCHUP_RECENT` field will be ignored.

:::

### Synced

When the node is done catching up, its state will change to:

```json
"state" : "Synced!"
```
