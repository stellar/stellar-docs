title: Publishing History Archives
sidebar_position: 50
---

If you want to run a [Full Validator](../README.mdx#full-validator), you need to set up your node to publish a history archive. You can host an archive using a blob store such as Amazon's S3 or Digital Ocean's spaces, or you can simply serve a local archive directly via an HTTP server such as Nginx or Apache. If you're setting up a [Basic Validator](../README.mdx#basic-validator), you can skip this section. No matter what kind of node you're planning to run, make sure to set it up to `get` history, which is covered in [Environment Preparation](./environment-preparation.mdx).

## Caching and History Archives

The _primary_ cost of running a validator will very likely be egress bandwidth. A crucial part of your strategy to manage those costs should be caching. You can significantly reduce these data transfer costs by using common caching techniques or a CDN. Three simple rules apply to caching the History archives:

1. Do not cache the archive state file `.well-known/stellar-history.json` (`Cache-Control: no-cache`)
2. Do not cache HTTP 4xx responses (`Cache-Control: no-cache`)
3. Cache everything else for as long as possible (**> 1 day**)

## Local History Archive Using nginx

Here, we'll demonstrate how you can configure your node to store its history files in the local filesystem, and then publish that history using nginx for our webserver software.

First, you must add a history configuration stanza to your `/etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg` configuration file.

```toml
[HISTORY.local]
get="cp /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/{0} {1}"
put="cp {0} /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/{1}"
mkdir="mkdir -p /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/{0}"
```

Then, you must run Stellar Core's `new-hist` command to create the local history archive.

```bash
sudo -u stellar stellar-core --conf /etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg new-hist local
```

This command creates the history archive structure:

```bash
$ tree -a /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/
/mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive
└── node_001
    ├── history
    │   └── 00
    │       └── 00
    │           └── 00
    │               └── history-00000000.json
    └── .well-known
        └── stellar-history.json

6 directories, 2 files
```

Now that the history archive's file structure is ready, you can configure a virtual host in nginx to serve the local archive.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  root /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/;

  server_name history.example.com;

  # default is to deny all
  location / { deny all; }

  # do not cache 404 errors
  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
  }

  # do not cache history state file
  location ~ ^/.well-known/stellar-history.json$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
    try_files $uri;
  }

  # cache entire history archive for 1 day
  location / {
    add_header Cache-Control "max-age=86400";
    try_files $uri;
  }
}
```

## Amazon S3 History Archive

Now, let's demonstrate a configuration where your node stores its history files using Amazon's S3 service. You can then publish that history using an Amazon S3 static site, or again use nginx for your webserver software. This time, using nginx, we'll include some proxy and CDN configuration, as well.

Start by adding a history configuration stanza to your `/etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg` configuration file.

```toml
[HISTORY.s3]
get='curl -sf http://history.example.com/{0} -o {1}' # Cached HTTP endpoint
put='aws s3 cp --region us-east-1 {0} s3://bucket.name/{1}' # Direct S3 access
```

Then, you must run Stellar Core's `new-hist` command to create and initialize the S3 archive.

```bash
sudo -u stellar stellar-core --conf /etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg new-hist s3
```

These S3 history files can be served with something as simple as an Amazon S3 static site.

Optionally, you may want to place a reverse proxy and CDN in front of the S3 static site (we'll use nginx for this example).

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  root /srv/nginx/history.example.com;
  index index.html index.htm;

  server_name history.example.com;

  # use google nameservers for lookups
  resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4;

  # bucket.name s3 static site endpoint
  set $s3_bucket "bucket.name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com";

  # default is to deny all
  location / { deny all; }

  # do not cache 404 errors
  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
  }

  # do not cache history state file
  location ~ ^/.well-known/stellar-history.json$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
    proxy_intercept_errors on;
    proxy_pass  http://$s3_bucket;
    proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header        Host            $s3_bucket;
    proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }

  # cache history archive for 1 day
  location / {
    add_header Cache-Control "max-age=86400";
    proxy_intercept_errors on;
    proxy_pass  http://$s3_bucket;
    proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header        Host            $s3_bucket;
    proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
```

## Backfilling a History Archive

Given the choice, it's best to configure your history archive _prior to_ your node's initial sync with an existing network. That way your validator's history publishes as you join, and subsequently sync with, the network.

However, if you have not published an archive during the node's initial sync, the steps required to create a history archive for an existing validator — in other words, to upgrade a Basic Validator to a Full Validator — are quite straightforward. First, you'll need to stop your `stellar-core` instance:

```bash
systemctl stop stellar-core # modify this if not using systemctl
```

Then, add the history archive configuration to your node's `/etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg` configuration file.

```toml
[HISTORY.local]
get="cp /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/{0} {1}"
put="cp {0} /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/{1}"
mkdir="mkdir -p /mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/{0}"
```

Next, you must run Stellar Core's `new-hist` command to create and initialize the local archive. (This is done as the `stellar` user.)

```bash
sudo -u stellar stellar-core --conf /etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg new-hist local
```

Now you can start your Stellar Core instance again:

```bash
systemctl start stellar-core # modify this if not using systemctl
```

As you allow your node to join the network again, you can watch it start publishing a few checkpoints to the newly created archive.

```log
2019-04-25T12:30:43.275 GDUQJ [History INFO] Publishing 1 queued checkpoints [16895-16895]: Awaiting 0/0 prerequisites of: publish-000041ff
```

At this stage your validator is successfully publishing its history, which enables other users to join the network using your archive.

## Complete History Archive

The [stellar-archivist](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/tools/stellar-archivist) command line tool can be used to mirror, scan, and repair existing archives. Using the [SDF package repositories](https://github.com/stellar/packages), you can install `stellar-archivist` by running:

```bash
apt-get install stellar-archivist
```

If you decide to publish a complete archive — which enables other users to join the network from the genesis ledger — you can use `stellar-archivist` to add all missing history data to your partial archive, and to verify the state and integrity of your archive. For example:

``` bash
stellar-archivist scan file:///mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001
```

```log

2019/04/25 11:42:51 Missing transactions (260): [0x0000003f-0x000040ff]
2019/04/25 11:42:51 Missing results (260): [0x0000003f-0x000040ff]
2019/04/25 11:42:51 No missing buckets referenced in range [0x0000003f, 0x0000417f]
2019/04/25 11:42:51 324 errors scanning checkpoints
```

As you can tell from the output of the `scan` command, some history, ledger, transactions, and results are missing from the local history archive.

You can repair the missing data using stellar-archivist's `repair` command combined with a known full archive — such as the SDF public history archive:

```bash
stellar-archivist repair http://history.stellar.org/prd/core-testnet/core_testnet_001/ file:///mnt/xvdf/stellar-core-archive/node_001/
```

```log

A final scan of the local archive confirms that it has been successfully repaired

```

Finally, you can start your stellar Core instance once again.

```bash
systemctl start stellar-core
```

You should now have a complete history archive being written by your full validator. Congratulations!
