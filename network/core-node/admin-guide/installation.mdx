There are three ways to install Stellar Core:

- You can build from [source](#installing-from-source),
- use pre-built [packages](#package-based-installation), or
- use a [Docker image](#docker-based-installation),

Using a Docker image is the quickest and easiest method, so it's a good choice for a lot of developers, but if you're running Stellar Core in production you may need to use packages or, if you want to sacrifice convenience for maximum control, build from source.

## Release Version

Whichever method you use, you should make sure to install the latest [release](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases) since these builds are backwards compatible and are cumulative.

The version number scheme that we follow is `protocol_version.release_number.patch_number`, where:

- `protocol_version` is the maximum protocol version supported by that release (all versions are 100% backward compatible),
- `release_number` is bumped when a set of new features or bug fixes not impacting the protocol are included in the release, and
- `patch_number` is used when a critical fix has to be deployed.

## Installing From Source

The Stellar Core source code repository contains extensive and thorough instructions to build the software from source. Please [check out `INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for more information.

## Package-Based Installation

If you are using a recent LTS version of Ubuntu, we provide the latest stable releases of [`stellar-core`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core) and [`stellar-horizon`](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon) in Debian binary package format.

You may choose to install these packages individually, which offers the greatest flexibility, but requires **manual** creation of the relevant configuration files and configuration of a **PostgreSQL** database.

## Docker-Based Installation

### Development Environments

SDF maintains a [quickstart image](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) that bundles Stellar's "Captive Core" with Horizon and the necessary PostgreSQL databases. It's a quick way to set up a default, non-validating, ephemeral configuration that should work for most developers. Additionally, the quickstart image can be spun up pre-configured for use as a Mainnet, Testnet, Futurenet, or Local network node.

<Alert>

The quickstart image is not intended to serve as a production-level instance node. Please plan your production instance(s) carefully.

</Alert>

### Production Environments

SDF also maintains a Stellar-Core-only standalone image, [`stellar/stellar-core`](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-core).

Example usage:

```bash
docker run stellar/stellar-core:latest help
docker run stellar/stellar-core:latest gen-seed
```

To run the Stellar Core daemon you need to provide a configuration file:

```bash
# Initialize postgres DB (see DATABASE config option)
docker run -v "/path/to/config/dir:/etc/stellar/" stellar/stellar-core:latest new-db
# Run stellar-core daemon in the background
docker run -d -v "/path/to/config/dir:/etc/stellar/" stellar/stellar-core:latest run
```

The image utilizes deb packages so it's possible to confirm the checksum of the `stellar-core` binary in the docker image matches what is in the cryptographically signed deb package. See [packages documentation](https://github.com/stellar/packages/) for information on installing Ubuntu packages. To calculate this checksum in the docker image you can run:

```bash
docker run --entrypoint=/bin/sha256sum stellar/stellar-core:latest /usr/bin/stellar-core
```
