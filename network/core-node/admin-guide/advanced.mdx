This page contains information that is useful to know but that should not stop
somebody from running a node.

## Creating Your Own Private Network

The [stellar-core GitHub repository] holds [a `testnet.md` file] which contains
a short tutorial demonstrating how to configure and run a short-lived, isolated
test network.

## Runtime Information: Start and Stop

Stellar-core can be started directly from the command line, or through a
supervision system such as `init`, `upstart`, or `systemd`.

Stellar-core can be gracefully exited at any time by delivering `SIGINT` or
pressing `CTRL-C`. It can be safely, forcibly terminated with `SIGTERM` or
`SIGKILL`. The latter may leave a stale lock file in the `BUCKET_DIR_PATH`, and
you may need to remove this file before stellar-core will restart. Broadly
speaking, all components are designed to recover from abrupt termination.

Stellar-core can also be packaged in a container system such as Docker, so long
as `BUCKET_DIR_PATH` and the database are stored on persistent volumes. For an
example, see [`stellar/quickstart`].

## In-depth Architecture

The [stellar-core GitHub repository] also contains [the `architecture.md` file],
which describes how stellar-core is structured internally, how it is intended to
be deployed, and the collection of servers and services needed to get the full
functionality and performance.
