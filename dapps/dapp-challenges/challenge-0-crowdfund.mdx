# Crowdfund Dapp Challenge

This challenge will guide you through the process of building and shipping a crowdfunding dapp on Stellar using Soroban. You will learn how to deploy smart contracts to Futurenet, and how to interact with them through a web frontend. In this context, the term "ship" refers to finalizing the development process of your dapp, ensuring that it functions as expected, and is accessible for user interaction and testing through a hosted frontend. However, it's crucial to clarify that despite its functionality, the dapp is not promoted nor intended for deployment in a production-level setting on Futurenet. The challenge is designed for educational purposes, helping you understand how a dapp can be built and interacted with, with further customization and development, it has the potential to evolve into a full-fledged, ready-to-use crowdfunding solution.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install üìö

Start by installing the required dependencies.

Required:

- `soroban-cli alias`: [Download Soroban Alias](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp#install-dependencies)
- `docker` (Standalone backend requires it): [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- `Node` v18: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

First, clone the Soroban example dapp repo and check out the `challenge` branch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp
cd soroban-example-dapp
git checkout challenge
```

Then, install soroban-cli alias by running the following command:

```sh
cargo install_soroban
```

Next, make sure that your Docker daemon is running by either opening [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (recommended) or following the instructions provided  [here](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/start/).

Then, and build the soroban-preview docker image:

```sh
make build-docker
```

Building the docker image lets you avoid installing the specific version of soroban-cli if desired.

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Launch Backend üåê

Open your Docker Desktop app and make sure it is running. Then run the following command to start the backend:

```sh
./quickstart.sh standalone
```

and wait for it to start.

## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that the backend environment is set up, we need to deploy our smart contracts to in a sandbox environment.

In another terminal, load the contracts and initialize them on the Standalone network by running the following commands:

```sh
npm run clean
NETWORK=standalone npm run setup
```
If the command runs successfully, your terminal will return a series of messages notifying you about the successful initialization of the contracts and the post-installation sequence.

```sh
Contract deployed succesfully with ID: CBXHU5BWWTOCZRYX3DMSSKCFG7B3K2YG2I5F75ALPQ6GCY6ZES2XKLTI
Deploy the crowdfund contract
Contract deployed succesfully with ID: CBKY7UN5VGD4LIQFOBOTSUSQWK67BZZTA23NIEVWSWRR5SAT26JQN2BN
Initialize the abundance token contract

Initialize the crowdfund contract

Done

> soroban-example-dapp@0.1.0 build-contracts
...
```


## Checkpoint 3: ü§ù Connect the Frontend to the Backend

First, start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should be able to see the frontend of your dapp.

> Note: Follow the instructions below and ensure that you have funded your wallet address that you intend to use from browser, otherwise the dapp display will be blank and a 'Account not found' will be printed on browser's console only.

Now that we have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with our smart contracts.

First, be sure that you have properly configured the Freighter Wallet by following the instructions [here](../guides/wallets#connect-a-wallet-freighter).

Then, add the Standalone network in Freighter:

- Name: `Standalone`
- URL: `http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc`
- Passphrase: `Standalone Network ; February 2017`
- Allow HTTP connection: `Enabled`
- Switch to this network: `Enabled`

Next, add some Standalone network lumens to your Freighter wallet by doing the following:

- Copy the address for your freighter wallet.
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/friendbot?addr=<your_address>`

> Note: These are test lumens for use with your local network and cannot be used on Futurenet or Mainnet

## Checkpoint 4: üè¶ Mint Tokens for the Crowdfunding Campaign

Open the dapp frontend and click on the "Mint 100 ABND" button.

<img src={mintToken} width="40%" />

You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction. Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

<img src={approveTokenMint} width="40%" />

You should see an updated balance in the pledge component.

<img src={updatedBalance} width="40%" />

> Note: These are test tokens for use with your local network and cannot be used on Futurenet or Mainnet

## Checkpoint 5: üí∞ Fund the Crowdfunding Campaign

Now that you have your wallet set up, let's fund the crowdfunding campaign.

Open the frontend and click on the "Back this project" button. You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction.

<img src={back100} width="40%" />

Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see a success message.

<img src={success} width="40%" />

You should see an updated balance in the amount you have pledged in the pledge component.

<img src={backedResult} width="40%" />

## Checkpoint 6: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

Now that your dapp is fully functional locally, next prepare it for deployment on Futurenet.

Stop the development server by pressing `ctrl+c` in the terminal where it is running.

If you are running docker, now is a good time to stop the Stellar and Soroban preview containers.

```sh
docker stop stellar soroban-preview
```

Then, run the following commands to initialize the contracts on Futurenet:

```sh
npm run clean
npm run setup
```

Then run the dev server again:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now, open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 

Ensure that you are connected to Futurenet and you should be able to see the frontend of your dapp!

Next, you will use the Vercel cli to complete our deployment.

> Note: If you don‚Äôt already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your GitHub account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```sh
npm i global vercel
```

Then, run the following command to deploy your dapp:

```sh
npx vercel
```

Then, continue through the prompts (you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
Vercel CLI 30.1.1
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://soroban-example-dapp-rho.vercel.app [42s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed dapp! üéâ

<img src={deployedDApp} width="90%" />

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet to interact with the deployed dapp. Visit [https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet), and follow the instructions to create your Freighter account on Futurenet.

## Checkpoint 7: ‚úÖ Complete the Challenge!

Submit your public URL to the challenge form.

<ParentChallengeForm courseId={0} />

## Checkpoint 8: üí™ Flex!

Invite a friend to try out your dapp and ask them to provide feedback!

## ‚öîÔ∏è Side Quests

üåê Explore [Stellar Laboratory] to inspect your account assets on Futurenet.

You should see something like this:

```json
  "balances": [
    {
      "balance": "100.0000000",
      "limit": "922337203685.4775807",
      "buying_liabilities": "0.0000000",
