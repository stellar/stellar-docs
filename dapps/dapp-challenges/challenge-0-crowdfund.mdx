This challenge will guide you through the process of building and shipping a crowdfunding dapp on Stellar using Soroban. You will learn how to deploy smart contracts to Futurenet, and how to interact with them through a web frontend. In this context, the term "ship" refers to finalizing the development process of your dapp, ensuring that it functions as expected, and is accessible for user interaction and testing through a hosted frontend. However, it's crucial to clarify that despite its functionality, the dapp is not promoted nor intended for deployment in a production-level setting on Futurenet. The challenge is designed for educational purposes, helping you understand how a dapp can be built and interacted with, with further customization and development, it has the potential to evolve into a full-fledged, ready-to-use crowdfunding solution.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install üìö

Start by installing the required dependencies.

Required:

- `soroban-cli alias`: [Download Soroban Alias](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp#install-dependencies)
- `Node` v18: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

First, clone the Soroban Dapps Challenge repo and check out the `crowdfund` branch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge.git
cd soroban-dapps-challenge
git checkout crowdfund
```

Then, install soroban-cli alias by running the following command:

```sh
cargo install_soroban
```

## Checkpoint 1: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that you have the Crowdfund branch checked out, it's time to deploy the smart contracts to a Sandbox environment.

In your terminal, load the contracts and initialize them in the Sandbox environment by running the following commands:

```sh
npm run setup
```

If the command runs successfully, your terminal will return a series of messages notifying you about the successful initialization of the contracts and the post-installation sequence.

```sh
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBXHU5BWWTOCZRYX3DMSSKCFG7B3K2YG2I5F75ALPQ6GCY6ZES2XKLTI
Deploy the crowdfund contract
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBKY7UN5VGD4LIQFOBOTSUSQWK67BZZTA23NIEVWSWRR5SAT26JQN2BN
Initialize the abundance token contract

Initialize the crowdfund contract

Done

> soroban-example-dapp@0.1.0 build-contracts
...
```

:::caution

Please, save your deployed contract ID, you will need it to complete the challenge.

## Checkpoint 2: ü§ù Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Now that you have the smart contracts deployed, it's time to check out the frontend of your dapp.

First, start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should be able to see the frontend of your dapp.

> Note: Follow the instructions below and ensure that you have funded your wallet address that you intend to use from browser, otherwise the dapp display will be blank and a 'Account not found' will be printed on browser's console only. If you are using Freighter, be sure that you have properly configured the Freighter Wallet by following the instructions [here](../guides/wallets#connect-a-wallet-freighter).

Now that you have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with your smart contracts.

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your wallet to interact with the dapp. Visit https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet, and follow the instructions to create and or fund an account on Futurenet.

> Note: These are test lumens for use with Futurenet and cannot be used on Mainnet

## Checkpoint 3: üåü Powering the Campaign

Fuel the vision! In this step, you will learn how to mint tokens and fund the crowdfunding campaign.

<Tabs defaultValue="mint" values={[
    {label: 'üè¶ Mint Tokens', value: 'mint'},
    {label: 'üí∞ Fund the Campaign', value: 'fund'},
]}>

<TabItem value="mint">

<Tabs defaultValue="openDapp" values={[
    {label: 'Mint', value: 'openDapp'},
    {label: 'Approve', value: 'approveTx'},
    {label: 'Check', value: 'checkBalance'},
]}>

<TabItem value="openDapp">

#### Open Dapp and Mint

Open the dapp frontend and click on the "Mint 100 ABND" button.

<img src={mintToken} width="40%" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="approveTx">

#### Approve Transaction

You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction. Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

<img src={approveTokenMint} width="40%" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="checkBalance">

#### Check Updated Balance

You should see an updated balance in the pledge component.

<img src={updatedBalance} width="40%" />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="fund">

<Tabs defaultValue="setupWallet" values={[
    {label: 'Deposit', value: 'setupWallet'},
    {label: 'Approve', value: 'approveTx'},
    {label: 'Check', value: 'confirmBalance'},
]}>

<TabItem value="setupWallet">

#### Fund the Campaign

Now that you have your wallet set up, let's fund the crowdfunding campaign. Open the frontend and click on the "Back this project" button. You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction.

<img src={back100} width="40%" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="approveTx">

#### Approve Transaction

Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed. Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see a success message.

<img src={success} width="40%" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="confirmBalance">

#### Check Updated Pledged Amount

You should see an updated balance reflecting the amount you have pledged in the pledge component.

<img src={backedResult} width="40%" />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

> Note: These are test tokens for use with Futurenet and cannot be used on Mainnet.

<CompleteStepButton id={0} progress={2}>
  Funding completed
</CompleteStepButton>

## Checkpoint 4: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

Now that your dapp is fully functional, next prepare it for a new deployment on Futurenet, this time with a hosted frontend.

Then, run the following commands to initialize the contracts on Futurenet:

```sh
npm run reset
```

Then run the dev server again:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now, open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Ensure that you are connected to Futurenet and you should be able to see the frontend of your dapp!

Next, you will need to remove unneccessary files for the the deployment. Run the following command to remove the `target` directory:

```sh
rm -rf target
```

Next, you will use the Vercel cli to complete our deployment.

> Note: If you don‚Äôt already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your GitHub account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```sh
npm i --global vercel
```

Then, run the following command to deploy your dapp:

```sh
npx vercel --prod
```

Then, continue through the prompts (you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
Vercel CLI 30.1.1
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://soroban-example-dapp-rho.vercel.app [42s]
```

:::caution

Please, save your production url, you will need it to complete the challenge.
