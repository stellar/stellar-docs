This challenge will guide you through the process of setting up, customizing, and deploying the Example Soroban Payment Dapp, and building a blockchain-powered payment application designed to work with the Freighter wallet.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- `Node` (>=16.14.0 < 17.0.0): [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Yarn` (v1.22.5 or newer): [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Clone the Repository

Clone and set up the Example Soroban Payment Dapp repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge.git
cd soroban-dapps-challenge
git checkout payment
yarn
```

## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

For this step you will need to clone and deploy the Soroban token smart contracts. The Soroban token is a custom token that will be used to facilitate payments in the Payment Dapp.

In a new terminal window, follow the steps below to build and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples.git
cd soroban-examples/token
make
```

This will build the smart contracts and put them in the `token/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.

Next, you will need to deploy the smart contracts to Futurenet. To do this, open a terminal in the `soroban-examples/token` directory and follow the steps below:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
    --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022'
```

This will return a contract id that we will need to use in the next step.

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
    --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- initialize \
    --admin <ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY> \
    --decimal 7 \
    --name "Demo Token" \
    --symbol "DT"
```

Lets take a look at what is happening here:

- Admin Account: This is the public key of the administrator account. It is the 'master' account that has control over the token contract.

- Decimal Precision: We set this value to 7. This indicates that your token will have 7 decimal places, providing fine-grained control and flexibility in transactions.

- Name: We set this value to 'Demo Token'. This is the name of your token written as a string. In this case, we use a string, 'Demo Token'.

- Symbol: Your token symbol is a short string that represents your token. In this case, we use a string, 'DT'.

Next we will need to mint some tokens to your sender's account. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
    --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- mint \
    --to <USER_PUBLIC_KEY> \
    --amount 1000000000
```

## Checkpoint 3: üñ•Ô∏è Launch the Frontend

Make sure that the frontend of the Payment Dapp successfully communicates with the backend, allowing transactions to be created, signed, and submitted to the network.

Open a terminal in the `soroban-react-payment` directory and run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
$ webpack-dev-server --config config/webpack.dev.js
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:9000/
...
```

Now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`. You should see the Payment Dapp running in your browser.

## Checkpoint 4: üöÄ Token Transfer Odyssey

Strap in and get ready to send some tokens! In this step, you will use the Payment Dapp to send Soroban tokens to another account.

<Tabs defaultValue="addToken" values={[
    {label: 'üì° Add Token to Freighter', value: 'addToken'},
    {label: 'üè¶ Send Tokens', value: 'sendTokens'},
]}>

<TabItem value="addToken">
<Tabs defaultValue="connectWallet" values={[
    {label: 'Connect', value: 'connectWallet'},
    {label: 'Add', value: 'addSoroban'},
    {label: 'Check', value: 'verifyToken'},
]}>

<TabItem value="connectWallet">

#### üì° Connect Freighter to Payment Dapp

Follow the steps in the [Connect a Wallet: Freighter](../guides/wallets.mdx) guide to connect Freighter to the Payment Dapp.

<img src={confirm_pmt} alt="confirm payment" />

Once signed, click the "Submit Payment" button, and the transaction will be submitted to the network.
<img src={submit_pmt} alt="submit payment" />

The Payment Dapp will show a confirmation message once the transaction has been successfully submitted.
<img src={end} alt="end" />

You can now check the balance of the receiving account to ensure that the transaction was successful.
<img src={balance_rcvr} alt="balance receiver" width="50%" />

You can also check the balance of an account with the soroban-cli by running the following command:

```bash
 soroban contract invoke \
    --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
    --source-account <ANY_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- balance \
    --id <RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY>
```


Output:

```bash
"1000000000"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>

## Checkpoint 5: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

You can upload your dapp to a hosting platform of your choice. You could use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or even an AWS S3 bucket.

For this example, we will use the Vercel cli to complete your deployment

> Note: If you dont already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your GitHub account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```bash
npm i --global vercel
```

Then run the following command to deploy your app:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Then continue through the prompts until you see the following output:

```bash
No framework detected. Default Project Settings:
- Build Command: 'npm run vercel-build' or 'npm run build'
- Development Command: None
- Install Command: 'yarn install', 'pnpm install', or 'npm install'
- Output Directory: 'public' if it exists, or '.'
```

Select `y` to continue, and then select `build` as the output directory.

```bash
? Want to modify these settings? [y/N] y
? Which settings would you like to overwrite (select multiple)? Output Directory
? Output Directory? build
```

Once the deployment is complete, you should see something similar to the following output:

```bash
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-react-payment (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-react-payment/AQoFFhZf5K1ufQj57eawApPkFduf [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://soroban-react-payment.vercel.app [58s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed dapp! üéâ

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet to interact with the deployed dapp. Visit [https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account), and follow the instructions to create your Freighter account on Futurenet.
