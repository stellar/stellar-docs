This challenge is designed for educational purposes and helps you understand how a dapp can be built and interacted with in a sandbox environment.

This challenge will walk you through the step-by-step journey of creating and launching a liquidity pool dapp on Stellar, all while using Soroban in a sandbox environment. You will learn how to deploy smart contracts to a sandbox environment and how to interact with them through a web frontend. In this context, the term "ship" refers to finalizing the development process of your dapp, ensuring that it functions as expected, and is accessible for user interaction and testing through a hosted frontend. However, it's crucial to clarify that despite its functionality, the dapp is not promoted nor intended for deployment in a production-level setting on Futurenet.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install üìö

Start by installing the required dependencies.

Required:

- `soroban-cli`: [Download Soroban-CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli)
- `docker` (standalone backend requires it): [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- `Node` v18: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

First, clone the Soroban example dapp repo and navigate to the `liquidity-pool` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge
cd soroban-dapps-challenge/liquidity-pool
yarn
```

Next, ensure that your Docker daemon is running by either opening [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (recommended) or following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/start/) and proceed to the next step.

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Launch Backend üåê

Open your Docker Desktop app and make sure it is running. Then run the following command to start the backend:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --name stellar \
  stellar/quickstart:soroban-dev \
  --standalone \
  --enable-soroban-rpc
```

and wait for it to start.

## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that the backend environment is set up, you must deploy your smart contracts to a sandbox environment.

In another terminal, load the contracts and initialize them on the Standalone network by running the following commands:

```bash
./initialize.sh standalone
```

If the command runs successfully, your terminal will return a series of messages notifying you about the successful initialization of the contracts and the post-installation sequence.

```bash
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBXHU5BWWTOCZRYX3DMSSKCFG7B3K2YG2I5F75ALPQ6GCY6ZES2XKLTI
Deploy the liquidity pool contract
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBKY7UN5VGD4LIQFOBOTSUSQWK67BZZTA23NIEVWSWRR5SAT26JQN2BN
Initialize the abundance token contract

Initialize the liquidity pool contract

Done

> soroban-example-dapp@0.1.0 build-contracts
...
```

<CompleteStepButton id={2} progress={1}>
  Mark smart contracts deployed
</CompleteStepButton>

## Checkpoint 3: ü§ù Connect the Frontend to the Backend

For this step, you must change the existing contract configuration to suit a local deployment.

First, navigate to `frontend/src/contracts.ts` and change `const rpcUrl`:

```diff
-const rpcUrl = 'https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org'
+const rpcUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc'
```

Then, change each contract network to `standalone`:

```diff
-export const tokenAContract = new TokenA({ ...networksA.futurenet, rpcUrl })
-export const tokenBContract = new TokenB({ ...networksB.futurenet, rpcUrl })
-export const shareTokenContract = new ShareToken({ ...networksShareToken.futurenet, rpcUrl })
-export const liquidityPoolContract = new LiquidityPool({ ...networksLiquidityPool.futurenet, rpcUrl })

+export const tokenAContract = new TokenA({ ...networksA.standalone, rpcUrl })
+export const tokenBContract = new TokenB({ ...networksB.standalone, rpcUrl })
+export const shareTokenContract = new ShareToken({...networksShareToken.standalone,rpcUrl})
+export const liquidityPoolContract = new LiquidityPool({...networksLiquidityPool.standalone, rpcUrl })
```

Then, navigate to the frontend folder and run the development server:

```bash
cd path/to/soroban-dapps-challenge/liquidity-pool/frontend
make setup && make start_dev
```

> Note: This may require admin privileges on some systems.

Now open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/). You should be able to see the frontend of your dapp.

> Note: Follow the instructions below and ensure that you have funded the wallet address that you intend to use from the browser. Otherwise, the dapp display will be blank and 'Account not found' will be printed on the browser's console. Furthermore, the example endpoint may differ from your local endpoint.

Now that you have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with your smart contracts.

First, ensure that you have properly configured the Freighter wallet by following the instructions [here](../guides/wallets#connect-a-wallet-freighter).

Then, add the Standalone network in Freighter:

- Name: `Standalone`
- URL: `http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc`
- Passphrase: `Standalone Network ; February 2017`
- Allow HTTP connection: `Enabled`
- Switch to this network: `Enabled`

Next, add some Standalone network lumens to your Freighter wallet by doing the following:

- Copy the address for your Freighter wallet.
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/friendbot?addr=<your_address>`

> Note: These are test lumens for use with your local network and cannot be used on Futurenet or Mainnet.

## Checkpoint 4: üè¶ Mint Tokens for the Liquidity Pool

Open the dapp frontend and click the "MINT" button for USDC and BTC.

<img src={mint_tokens} width="40%" />

You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transactions. Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

<img src={approveTokenMint} width="40%" />

You should see an updated balance in the account balance component.

<img src={updatedBalances} width="40%" />

> Note: These are test tokens for use with your local network and cannot be used on Futurenet or Mainnet.

## Checkpoint 5: üí∞ Deposit into the Liquidity Pool

Now that your wallet is set up, let's fund the liquidity pool.

Open the frontend, enter the desired token amounts, and click the "Deposit" button. You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction.

<img src={deposit50} width="75%" />

Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see your balances updated.

<img src={updatedBalances50} width="40%" />

You should see an updated balance in the amounts you have deposited in the account and reserve balance components, respectively. Following the example, you should see 50 USDC, 50 BTC, and 50 POOL.

## Checkpoint 6: üîÑ Make a Swap

Now that you have funded the liquidity pool, let's make a swap.

Open the swap tab, input the desired token swap amounts, and click the "Swap" button. You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction.

<img src={swap} width="75%" />

Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see updated balances on the frontend.

<img src={swapComplete} width="75%" />

## Checkpoint 7: ‚§¥Ô∏è Make a Withdrawal

Now that you have funded the liquidity pool, let's make a withdrawal.

Open the withdraw tab, select how much liquidity you want to remove with the sliding bar, and click the "Withdraw" button. You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction.

<img src={wdraw} width="75%" />

Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see updated balances on the frontend.

<CompleteStepButton id={2} progress={2}>
  Transactions completed
</CompleteStepButton>

## Checkpoint 8: üö¢ Ship It! üöÅ

Now that your dapp is fully functional locally, it's time to prepare it for deployment on Futurenet.

Stop the development server by pressing `ctrl+c` in the terminal where it is running.

If you are running docker, now is a good time to stop the Stellar and Soroban preview containers.

```bash
docker stop stellar soroban-preview
```

Then, run the following commands to initialize the contracts on Futurenet:

```bash
rm -rf .soroban
./initialize.sh futurenet
```

> Note: This will remove the existing contracts and initialize new ones on Futurenet.

Next, revert the changes made to the contract network configs [earlier](#checkpoint-3--connect-the-frontend-to-the-backend).

Navigate to `frontend/src/contracts.ts` and change `const rpcUrl`:

```diff
-const rpcUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc'
+const rpcUrl = 'https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org'
```

Then, change each contract network to Futurenet:

```diff
-export const tokenAContract = new TokenA({ ...networksA.standalone, rpcUrl })
-export const tokenBContract = new TokenB({ ...networksB.standalone, rpcUrl })
-export const shareTokenContract = new ShareToken({...networksShareToken.standalone, rpcUrl })
-export const liquidityPoolContract = new LiquidityPool({...networksLiquidityPool.standalone, rpcUrl })

+export const tokenAContract = new TokenA({ ...networksA.futurenet, rpcUrl })
+export const tokenBContract = new TokenB({ ...networksB.futurenet, rpcUrl })
+export const shareTokenContract = new ShareToken({ ...networksShareToken.futurenet, rpcUrl })
+export const liquidityPoolContract = new LiquidityPool({ ...networksLiquidityPool.futurenet, rpcUrl })
```

Then, navigate to the frontend directory and run the development server:

```bash
cd path/to/soroban-dapps-challenge/liquidity-pool/frontend
make start_dev
```

Now, open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).

Ensure that Freighter is connected to Futurenet, and you should be able to see the frontend of your dapp!

Next, you will remove the target directory, as it is not used by Vercel to deploy your site. To do this, run the following:

```
rm -rf target
```

Next, you must move your `.soroban` directory to the frontend directory.

From a terminal in the liquidity-pool directory, run the following command:

```bash
mv .soroban frontend/.soroban
```

Then, you need to update the `package.json` file in the frontend directory to point to the new contract binding locations.

```diff
-"liquidity-pool-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/liquidity-pool",
-"share-token-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/share-token",
-"token-a-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/token-a",
-"token-b-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/token-b",

+"liquidity-pool-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/liquidity-pool",
+"share-token-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/share-token",
+"token-a-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/token-a",
+"token-b-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/token-b",
```

Next, you will use the Vercel CLI to complete your deployment.

> Note: If you don‚Äôt already have a [Vercel account], you should create one and link it to your GitHub account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First, install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i global vercel
```

Then, open a terminal in the `liquidity-pool` directory and run the following command to deploy your example dapp:

```bash
npx vercel
```

Then, continue through the prompts until you see the following message about setting overrides:

```bash
? Want to override the settings? [y/N] y
? Which settings would you like to override? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
‚ùØ‚óØ Build Command
 ‚óØ Development Command
 ‚óØ Output Directory
```

Select each entry (type "a") and set the following values:

**build command**

```bash
cd frontend && make build
```

**development command**

```bash
cd frontend && make start_dev
```

**output directory**

```bash
frontend/dist
```

Once the deployment is complete, you should see a message similar to the following:

```bash
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/liquidity-pool (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/liquidity-pool/FfsAJdgUR9LKH5EmGiuMCMYUMTi2 [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://liquidity-pool.vercel.app [54s]
```
