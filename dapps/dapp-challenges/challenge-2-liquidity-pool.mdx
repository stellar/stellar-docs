This challenge is designed for educational purposes and helps you understand how a dapp can be built and interacted with in a sandbox environment.

This challenge will walk you through the step-by-step journey of creating and launching a liquidity pool dapp on Stellar, all while using Soroban in a sandbox environment. You will learn how to deploy smart contracts to a sandbox environment and how to interact with them through a web frontend. In this context, the term "ship" refers to finalizing the development process of your dapp, ensuring that it functions as expected, and is accessible for user interaction and testing through a hosted frontend. However, it's crucial to clarify that despite its functionality, the dapp is not promoted nor intended for deployment in a production-level setting on Futurenet.

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Install 📚

Start by installing the required dependencies.

Required:

- `soroban-cli`: [Download Soroban-CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli)
- `Node` v18: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

First, clone the Soroban example dapp repo and navigate to the `liquidity-pool` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge
cd soroban-dapps-challenge
git checkout liquidity-pool
```

Then, install soroban-cli alias by running the following command:

```sh
cargo install_soroban
```

## Checkpoint 1: 🎬 Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that you have the Liquidity Pool branch checked out, it's time to deploy the smart contracts to a Sandbox environment.

In your terminal, load the contracts and initialize them in the Sandbox environment by running the following commands:

```bash
./initialize.sh futurenet
```

If the command runs successfully, your terminal will return a series of messages notifying you about the successful initialization of the contracts and the post-installation sequence.

```bash
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBXHU5BWWTOCZRYX3DMSSKCFG7B3K2YG2I5F75ALPQ6GCY6ZES2XKLTI
Deploy the liquidity pool contract
Contract deployed successfully with ID: CBKY7UN5VGD4LIQFOBOTSUSQWK67BZZTA23NIEVWSWRR5SAT26JQN2BN
Initialize the abundance token contract

Initialize the liquidity pool contract

Done

> soroban-example-dapp@0.1.0 build-contracts
...
```

<ParentChallengeContractForm id={2} progress={1} />

## Checkpoint 2: 🤝 Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Navigate to the frontend folder and run the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
make setup && make start_dev
```

> Note: This may require admin privileges on some systems.

Now open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/). You should be able to see the frontend of your dapp.

> Note: Follow the instructions below and ensure that you have funded your wallet address that you intend to use from browser. If you are using Freighter, be sure that you have properly configured the Freighter Wallet by following the instructions [here](../guides/wallets#connect-a-wallet-freighter).

Now that you have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with your smart contracts.

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your wallet to interact with the dapp. Visit https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet, and follow the instructions to create and or fund an account on Futurenet.

> Note: These are test lumens for use on Futurenet and cannot be used on Mainnet

## Checkpoint 3: 🌊 Dive into the Liquidity Pool

Embark on a tidal journey! In this step you will mint, deposit, swap, and withdraw tokens from the liquidity pool.

## Checkpoint 4: 🚢 Ship It! 🚁
Now that your dapp is fully functional, its time to deploy it to a production environment. In this step, you will learn how to deploy your dapp to Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites that offers a quick and effective way to deploy the frontend of your dapp.

First, you will remove the target directory, as it is not used by Vercel to deploy your site. To do this, navigate to the `liquidity-pool` directory and run the following:

```
rm -rf target
```

>Note: You can build this directory again by running `soroban contract build` in the `contracts/abundance` directory.

Next, you must move your `.soroban` directory to the frontend directory.

From a terminal in the `liquidity-pool` directory, run the following command:

```bash
mv .soroban frontend/.soroban
```

Then, you need to update the `package.json` file in the frontend directory to point to the new contract binding locations.

```diff
-"liquidity-pool-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/liquidity-pool",
-"share-token-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/share-token",
-"token-a-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/token-a",
-"token-b-contract": "file:../.soroban/contracts/token-b",

+"liquidity-pool-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/liquidity-pool",
+"share-token-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/share-token",
+"token-a-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/token-a",
+"token-b-contract": "file:.soroban/contracts/token-b",
```

Next, you will use the Vercel CLI to complete your deployment.

> Note: If you don’t already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your GitHub account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First, install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i --global vercel
```

Then, open a terminal in the `liquidity-pool` directory and run the following command to deploy your example dapp:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Then, continue through the prompts until you see the following message about setting overrides:

```bash
? Want to override the settings? [y/N] y
? Which settings would you like to override? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
❯◯ Build Command
 ◯ Development Command
 ◯ Output Directory
```

Select each entry (type "a") and set the following values:

**build command**

```bash
cd frontend && make build
```

**development command**

```bash
cd frontend && make start_dev
```

**output directory**

```bash
frontend/dist
```

Once the deployment is complete, you should see a message similar to the following:

```bash
🔗  Linked to julian-dev28/liquidity-pool (created .vercel)
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/liquidity-pool/FfsAJdgUR9LKH5EmGiuMCMYUMTi2 [2s]
✅  Production: https://liquidity-pool.vercel.app [54s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed dapp! 🎉
