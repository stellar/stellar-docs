Soroban-RPC will accept HTTP POST requests using the [JSON-RPC 2.0] specification. Errors are returned via the [jsonrpc error object] wherever possible (and makes sense).

For production and other publicly-accessible instances, the JSON-RPC endpoint should be served over SSL on port 443, where possible, for security and ease of use. Though, soroban-rpc does not terminate ssl by itself, so will need a load-balancer or other service to terminate SSL for it.

To interact with soroban-rpc from inside a JavaScript application, use the [js-soroban-client] library, which gives a convenient interface for the RPC methods.

When XDR is passed as a parameter or returned, it is always a string encoded using standard base64.
