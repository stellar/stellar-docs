import {EndpointsTable} from "@site/src/components/EndpointsTable";

Organization endpoints manage the process of getting and updating organizational profile information. The organizationâ€™s profile has basic information set at the time of SDP deployment. It can be modified by the Owner. Organizations can also manage their preferences, like which assets to use, through these endpoints.
