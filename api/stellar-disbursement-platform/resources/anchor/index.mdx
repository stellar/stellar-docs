The registration endpoints guide the process for a receiver to verify their identity and link their wallet address to an SDP. The registration process only needs to happen once per receiver to link their wallet. Only SDP-compatible wallet providers can facilitate the registration process. These endpoints must be supported and hit by the wallet providers after the receiver gets the initial SMS invite. After the wallet address is successfully linked, the payment automatically begins.

The registration process uses SEP-10, SEP-24, and deep links. Please see this guide for a full set of instructions for wallet providers to become SDP-compatible.
