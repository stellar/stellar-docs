import {EndpointsTable} from "@site/src/components/EndpointsTable";

A disbursement is a group of payments sent to multiple individuals at once. An SDP user with the appropriate role triggers a new disbursement through the SDP dashboard by uploading a list of receivers and amounts. When the receiver has linked their wallet to the SDP, the payment automatically begins. SDP users can track their disbursements in real-time through the SDP dashboard. Each disbursement must have a unique name defined by the organization.
