An SDP payment is an individual payment from an organization to a receiver. Each payment is part of a disbursement and occurs on the Stellar network. Granular payment status is stored in the SDP database and can be viewed in real-time on the SDP dashboard. There is no POST endpoint because submitting payments to the Stellar network is handled by the Transaction Submission Service (TSS).
