import {EndpointsTable} from "@site/src/components/EndpointsTable";

The Anchor Platform does not store customer KYC data. Instead, the Anchor Platform forwards this data to and requests it from the business.

The customer callbacks are designed for this purpose. Currently, requests & responses for these endpoints are almost identical to the [SEP-12 KYC API specification][sep-12].
