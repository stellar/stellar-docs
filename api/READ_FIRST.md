# STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING

If you're here to make some fixes to Stellar's API documentation (first, thank
you!), you probably don't want to be in this location. Most of the API
documentation located here has been generated by the `.yml` files contained in
the [`/openapi`](../openapi/) directory. Unless you're working on something
that's _outside_ the `/api/resources` directory, you'll probably want to check
in `/openapi` instead of here.
