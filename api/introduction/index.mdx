Horizon is an API for interacting with the Stellar network.

This API serves the bridge between apps and [Stellar Core](../docs/run-core-node). Projects like wallets, decentralized exchanges, and asset issuers use Horizon to submit transactions, query an account balance, or stream events like transactions to an account.

Horizon is a [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and can be accessed via cURL, a browser, or one of the [Stellar SDKs](../docs/tools-and-sdks). To reduce the complexity of your project, we recommend you use an SDK instead of making direct API calls.

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) runs two instances of Horizon:

- [https://horizon.stellar.org/](https://horizon.stellar.org/) for interacting with the public network
- [https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/) for interacting with the [testnet](../docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/testnet-and-pubnet)
