This tutorial walks through how an application can leverage common streaming data patterns to ingest Stellar network transaction data using a few select packages from the Stellar Go Repo [github.com/stellar/go](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/) collectively known as the 'Ingestion' SDK:

## The Ingestion SDK packages

- `github.com/stellar/go/amount` utility package to convert prices from network transaction operations to string
- `github.com/stellar/go/historyarchive` `github.com/stellar/go/support/datastore` `github.com/stellar/go/support/storage` utility package with convenient wrappers for accessing history archives, and avoid low-level http aspects.
- `github.com/stellar/go/ingest` provides parsing functionality over the network ledger data, converts to more developer centric `LedgerTransaction` model
- `github.com/stellar/go/ingest/ledgerbackend` provides the captive core backend implementation
- `github.com/stellar/go/network` provides convenient pre-configured settings for testnet and pubnet networks.
- `github.com/stellar/go/xdr` a complete golang binding to the stellar network data model.

## Ingestion project setup

### Project requirements

To build an example streaming network ingestion pipeline from live Stellar network transaction data, you'll need:

- A developer workstation with [Go](https://go.dev/learn/) programming language runtime installed.
- An IDE to edit Go code, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is good if one needed.
- A newly initialized, empty Go project folder. `mkdir pipeline; cd pipeline; go mod init example/pipeline`
- `stellar-core` must be [installed](https://developers.stellar.org/network/core-node/admin-guide/installation) on your workstation and available on your o/s PATH.

The [Stellar network data model](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures) is defined in an IDL format expressed in[XDR encoding](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr). Our example application is only interested in a small subset of the overall transaction data model related to buying and selling of assets, i.e. a payment. and defines it's own data model internally:

<CodeExample>

```
::AppPayment
   Timestamp: uint
   BuyerAccountId: string
   SellerAccountId: string
   AssetCode: string
   Amount: string
}
```

</CodeExample>

The example application will run a [network ingestion pipeline](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/doc.go) to derive a smaller `ApplicationPayment` model from the [Stellar network transaction data model](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures) as 'source of origin' and thus enable the application to avoid large compute resources that would have been required for maintaing storage of the full stellar network data model.

The ingestion pipeline will perform three distinct stream processor roles:

### Inbound Adapter

Acts as the 'source of origin' for the pipeline. Retrieves [LedgerCloseMeta](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/f30d11432e81c7a7cbb739a694520f729bbb31dd/xdr/xdr_generated.go#L18358) generated from a Stellar network using captive core. `LedgerCloseMeta` is the top level aggregate in the Stellar data model of which all [Stellar network transaction data](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures) is nested within. Publishes the `LedgerCloseMeta` onto the pipeline.

### Transformer

Subscribes to receive `LedgerCloseMeta` from the pipeline. Uses the Go SDK package [github.com/stellar/go/xdr](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/xdr) to parse the nested network data model for payment operations and convert those into a new instance of application data model `ApplicationPayment` instances. Publishes `ApplicationPayment` to the pipeline.

### Outbound Adapter

Acts as the termination of the pipeline, it subscribes to receive `ApplicationPayment` and publishes the data off the pipeline and to an external data store, a ZeroMQ Publisher Socket, which is essentially a message broker.

### Summary

Refer to [Ingestion Pipeline Sample Application](ingestion-pipeline-code.mdx), for complete code demonstrating usage of the 'ingestion' sdk packages to create these adapters and transfomers and run a live pipeline against Stellar network.
