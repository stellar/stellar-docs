For an account to hold and trade assets other than XLM, it must establish a [trustline](../../fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/accounts#trustlines) with the issuing account of that particular asset. Each trustline increases the account’s [base reserve](../../fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/accounts#base-reserves-and-subentries) by 0.5 XLM, which means the account will have to hold more XLM in its minimum balance. In BasicPay, we’ve already funded the account on Testnet. When moving your application to Pubnet, you can either cover an account’s minimum balance using sponsored reserves, or the user will have to supply their own XLM.

## User experience

First, we’ll have the user create a trustline for an asset by navigating to the Assets page, selecting an asset, and clicking the “Add Asset” button.

This triggers a modal form for the user to confirm the transaction with their pincode. Once confirmed, a transaction containing the `changeTrust` operation is signed and submitted to the network, and a trustline is established between the user's account and the issuing account for the asset.

:::info

Every transaction must contain a sequence number that is used to identify and verify the order of transactions with the account. A transaction’s sequence number must always increase by one. In BasicPay, fetching and incrementing the sequence number is handled automatically by the transaction builder.

:::

The `changeTrust` operation can also be used to modify or remove trustlines.

Trustlines hold the balances for all of their associated assets (except XLM, which are held at the account level), and you can display the user’s various balances in your application.
