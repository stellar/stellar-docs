A path payment is where the asset sent can be different from the asset received. There are two possible path payment operations: 1) `path_payment_strict_send`, which allows the user to specify the amount of the asset to send, and 2) `path_payment_strict_receive`, which allows the user to specify the amount of the asset received.

## User experience

With BasicPay, the user sends a path payment by navigating to the Payments page, where they can either select a user from their contacts or input the public key of a destination address. They then select the Send and Receive Different Assets toggle and determine whether they want to specify the asset sent or received. Finally they select the asset sent and the asset received and the amounts and select the Preview Transaction button.

The user will then preview the transaction, input their pincode, and select the Confirm button to sign and submit the transaction to the network.

BasicPay also contains a swap feature, which allows the user to send themselves an asset in exchange for another asset. For example, receive USDC in exchange for your own XLM.
