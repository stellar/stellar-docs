SEP-6 allows wallets and other clients to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet to go to the anchor’s site. In this integration, a user’s KYC information is gathered and handled by the wallet.

#### Get `/info`

First, BasicPay requests the `/info` endpoint from the anchor to understand the supported transfer methods ([deposit, withdraw, deposit-exchange, and withdraw-exchange](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md)) and fee information.

#### Initiate transfer

The user then can initiate one of the transfer methods (in BasicPay, only deposits and withdraws are supported) by selecting “Deposit” or “Withdraw” from the drop-down menu and specifying the asset to be deposited or withdrawn. KYC

BasicPay then queries the anchor’s `sep-12` endpoint for the required KYC fields and presents these fields to the user. The user inputs this information and BasicPay PUTs that information to the KYC `/customer` endpoint. BasicPay then waits for the user’s `status` with the anchor to be approved.

#### Complete transfer

BasicPay then prompts the user to input additional information such as transfer type, destination, and amount.

Once approved, the user clicks “Next” and BasicPay initiates the transfer with the anchor.

In a withdrawal transaction, BasicPay will also present the user with a pre-built transaction for them to sign with their pincode.

:::info

All the fields that have been collected during this process are wrapped into a URL that contains query parameters: [example](https://testanchor.stellar.org/sep6/deposit?account=GAXQIC2BSZ5HZP3BD6RZQSD3LB66TB6A2TA5W3LZX2VDFMBAKHC4B62J&asset_code=SRT&type=bank_account&amount=11)
