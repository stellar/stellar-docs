SEP-24 provides a standard way for wallets and anchors to interact by having the user open a webview hosted by an anchor to collect and handle KYC information.

#### Authentication

The user must first prove they own the account before they can withdraw or deposit any assets as part of SEP-10: Stellar Web Authentication. In BasicPay, the user clicks on the “Authenticate” button, triggering a challenge transaction from the anchor to BasicPay as part of SEP-10: Stellar Web Authentication, which is then presented to the user to sign.

Once signed, BasicPay sends the transaction back to the anchor and then receives a session auth token, which is stored in the `webAuthStore` store.

#### Get `/info`

Similar to SEP-6, our application will request the `/info` endpoint from the anchor to understand the supported transfer methods (deposit, withdraw, deposit-exchange, and withdraw-exchange) and fee information.

#### Initiate and complete transfer

The user then initiates a transfer method (in BasicPay, only deposits and withdraws are supported) by POSTing a request to either the “SEP-24 Deposit” or “SEP-24 Withdraw” endpoint. The anchor then sends an interactive URL that BasicPay opens for the user to complete and confirm the transaction.

Once the user clicks “Submit”, they’ll be brought back to the application.

In a withdrawal transaction, BasicPay will also present the user with a pre-built transaction for them to sign with their pincode. `callback` should be in the form of a `postMessage`. Our application listens for that `postMessage` during the withdrawal and opens up the transaction dialog when the interactive flow is completed.
