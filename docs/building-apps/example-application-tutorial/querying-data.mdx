Throughout the application’s functionality, it will be querying data from Horizon, Stellar’s API. Information such as account balances, transaction history, sequence numbers for transactions, asset availability, and more are stored in Horizon’s database.

Functions to query:

- loadAccount: gives the account sequence number, asset balances, trustlines, and an account object that can be used in a transaction
- fetchAccount: gives all the same information as loadAccount, but doesn’t have the account object
- getAccountBalances
- submitTransaction
- that stellar.expert thing
