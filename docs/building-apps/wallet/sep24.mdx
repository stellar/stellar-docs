The [SEP-24] standard defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users. Wallets use this standard to facilitate exchanges between on-chain assets (such as stablecoins) and off-chain assets (such as fiat, or other network assets such as BTC).

During the flow, a wallet makes several requests to the anchor, and finally receives an interactive URL to open in iframe. This URL is used by the user to provide an input (such as KYC) directly to the anchor. Finally, the wallet can fetch transaction information using query endpoints.

## Get Anchor Information

Let's start with getting an instance of `Interactive` class, responsible for all SEP-24 interactions:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val sep24 = anchor.sep24()
```

```typescript
let sep24 = await anchor.sep24();
```

```dart
var sep24 = await anchor.sep24();
```

</CodeExample>

First, let's get the information about the anchor's support for [SEP-24]. This request doesn't require authentication, and will return generic info, such as supported currencies, and features supported by the anchor. You can get a full list of returned fields in the [SEP-24 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#info).

<CodeExample>

```kt
suspend fun getAnchorServices(): AnchorServiceInfo {
  return sep24.getServicesInfo()
}
```

```typescript
const getAnchorServices = async (): Promise<AnchorServiceInfo> => {
  return await anchor.getServicesInfo();
};
```

```dart
final servicesInfo = await sep24.getServiceInfo();
```

</CodeExample>

## Interactive Flows

Before getting started, make sure you have connected to the anchor and received an authentication token, as described in the [Stellar Authentication] wallet guide. We will use the `token` object in the examples below as the [SEP-10] authentication token, obtained earlier.

To initiate an operation, we need to know an asset. You may want to hard-code it, or get it dynamically from the anchor's info file, like shown above (for USDC):

<CodeExample>

```kt
val asset = info.currencies.first { it.code == "USDC" }.assetId
```

```typescript
const asset = info.currencies.find(({ code }) => code === "USDC").assetId;
```

```dart
var asset = info.currencies.firstWhere((it)=>it.code=='USDC').assetId;
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

Before starting with the deposit flow, make sure that the user account has [established a trustline](/docs/building-apps/wallet/stellar.mdx#modify-assets-trustlines) for the asset you are working with.

:::

### Basic Flow

Let's start with a basic deposit:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, token)
```

```typescript
let deposit = await anchor.sep24().deposit({
  assetCode,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
final deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, token)
```

</CodeExample>

As a result, you will get an [interactive response](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) from the anchor.

Open the received URL in an iframe and deposit the transaction ID for future reference:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val url = deposit.url
val id = deposit.id
```

```typescript
let url = deposit.url;
let id = deposit.id;
```

```dart
final url = deposit.url;
final id = deposit.id;
```

</CodeExample>

Similarly to the deposit flow, a basic withdrawal flow has the same method signature and repose type:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, token)
val url = withdrawal.url
val id = withdrawal.id
```

```typescript
let withdrawal = await anchor.sep24().withdraw({
  assetCode,
  authToken,
});
let url = withdrawal.url;
let id = withdrawal.id;
```

```dart
final withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, token)
final url = withdrawal.url
final id = withdrawal.id
```

</CodeExample>

### Providing KYC Info

To improve the user experience, the [SEP-24] standard supports passing user KYC to the anchor via [SEP-9]. In turn, the anchor will pre-fill this information in the interactive popup.

:::info

While [SEP-9] supports passing binary data, the current version of the SDK doesn't offer such functionality.

:::

:::note

At the time, accepted [SEP-9] is not strictly typed yet. Improved typing will be offered in future versions.

:::

<CodeExample>

```kt
val sep9 = mapOf("email_address" to "mail@example.com")

val deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, token, sep9)
```

```typescript
let deposit = await anchor.sep24().deposit({
  assetCode,
  authToken,
  extraFields: { email_address: "mail@example.com" },
});
```

```dart
final deposit = await sep24.deposit(asset, token,
  extraFields: {"email_address": "mail@example.com"});
```

</CodeExample>

### Changing Stellar Transfer Account

By default, the Stellar transfer will be sent to the authenticated account (with a memo) that initiated the deposit.

While in most cases it's acceptable, some wallets may split their accounts. To do so, pass additional account (and optionally a memo):

<CodeExample>

```kt
suspend fun depositDifferentAccount(): InteractiveFlowResponse {
  val recipientAccount = "G..."
  val memo = "my memo" to MemoType.TEXT
  return sep24.deposit(asset, token, destinationAccount = recipientAccount, destinationMemo = memo)
}
```

```typescript
import { Memo, MemoText } from "stellar-sdk";

const recipientAccount = "G...";
const depositDifferentAccount = async (): Promise<InteractiveFlowResponse> => {
  return anchor.sep24().deposit({
    destinationAccount: recipientAccount,
    destinationMemo: new Memo(MemoText, "some memo"),
    assetCode,
    authToken,
  });
};
```

```dart
const recipientAccount = "G...";
final deposit = await sep24.deposit(asset, token, destinationAccount: recipientAccount,
  destinationMemo: "my memo", destinationMemoType: MemoType.text);
```

</CodeExample>

Similarly, for a withdrawal, the origin account of the Stellar transaction could be changed:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val originAccount = "G..."
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, token, withdrawalAccount = originAccount)
```

```typescript
const originAccount = "G...";
const withdrawal = await anchor.sep24().withdraw({
  withdrawalAccount: originAccount,
  assetCode,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
const originAccount = "G...";
final withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, token, withdrawalAccount: originAccount);
```

</CodeExample>

## Getting Transaction Info

On the typical flow, the wallet would get transaction data to notify users about status updates. This is done via the [SEP-24] `GET /transaction` and `GET /transactions` endpoint.

Alternatively, some anchors support webhooks for notifications. Note that this feature is not widely adopted yet.

### Tracking Transaction

Let's look into how to use the wallet SDK to track transaction status changes. We will use `Watcher` class for this purpose. First, let's initialize watcher and start tracking a transaction.

<CodeExample>

```kt
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(token, "transaction id")
```

```typescript
let watcher = anchor.sep24().watcher();

let { stop, refresh } = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final watcher = sep24.watcher();
final result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(token, "transaction id");
```

</CodeExample>

Alternatively, we can track multiple transactions for the same asset.

<CodeExample>

```kt
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchAsset(getAuthToken(), asset)
```

```typescript
let watcher = anchor.sep24().watcher();

let { stop, refresh } = watcher.watchAllTransactions({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
  onMessage,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchAsset(token, asset)
```

</CodeExample>

<LanguageSpecific kt={<KtWatcher />} />

### Fetching Transaction

While `Watcher` class offers powerful tracking capabilities, sometimes it's required to just fetch a transaction (or transactions) once. The `Anchor` class allows you to fetch a transaction by ID, Stellar transaction ID, or external transaction ID:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val transaction = sep24.getTransactionBy(token, id = "transaction id")
```

```typescript
const transaction = await anchor.sep24().getTransactionBy({
  authToken,
  id: transactionId,
});
```

```dart
var transaction = await sep24.getTransaction("transaction id", token);
```

</CodeExample>

It's also possible to fetch transaction by the asset

<CodeExample>

```kt
val transactions = sep24.getTransactionsForAsset(asset, token)
```

```typescript
const transactions = await anchor.sep24().getTransactionsForAsset({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
});
```

```dart
var transactions = sep24.getTransactionsForAsset(asset, token);
```

</CodeExample>

## Submitting Withdrawal Transfer

Previously, we took a look at starting the withdrawal flow. Now, let's take a look at a full example.

First, start the withdrawal:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken = token)
```

```typescript
let withdrawal = await anchor.sep24().withdraw({
  assetCode,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
final withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw(asset, token)
```

</CodeExample>

Next, open an interactive url :

<CodeExample>

```kt
val url = withdrawal.url
// open the url
```

```typescript
let url = withdrawal.url;
// open the url
```

```dart
final url = withdrawal.url
// open the url
```

</CodeExample>

After that we need to wait until the anchor is ready to receive funds. To do so, we will be waiting until transaction reaches `pending_user_transfer_start` status

<CodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawalWatcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(token, withdrawal.id)
var statusChange: StatusUpdateEvent

// Wait for user input
do {
  statusChange = withdrawalWatcher.channel.receive()
} while (
  ((statusChange as? StatusChange) ?: throw Exception("Channel unexpectedly closed"))
    .status != TransactionStatus.PENDING_USER_TRANSFER_START
)
```

```typescript
let watcher = anchor.sep24().watcher();

let onMessage = (transaction) => {
  if (transaction.status === "pending_user_transfer_start") {
    // begin transfer code
  }
};

let { refresh, stop } = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final withdrawalWatcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(token, withdrawal.id)
withdrawalWatcher.controller.stream.listen(
  (event) {
    if (event is StatusChange && TransactionStatus.pendingUserTransferStart == event.status) {
      // begin transfer
    }
  },
  onError: (error) {
    // handle error
  },
);
```

</CodeExample>

Next, sign and submit the Stellar transfer:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val anchorTransaction = (statusChange.transaction as WithdrawalTransaction)
val transfer = stellar.transaction(keypair).transferWithdrawalTransaction(anchorTransaction, asset).build()

transfer.sign(keypair)

stellar.submitTransaction(transfer)
```

```typescript
const txBuilder = await stellar.transaction({
  sourceAddress: keypair,
  baseFee: 100,
});

const transfer = txBuilder
  .transferWithdrawalTransaction(walletTransaction, asset)
  .build();

keypair.sign(transfer);
stellar.submitTransaction(transfer);
```

```dart
final tx = event.transaction as WithdrawalTransaction;

final paymentBuilder = flutter_sdk.PaymentOperationBuilder(
  tx.withdrawAnchorAccount!,
  flutter_sdk.Asset.createNonNativeAsset(asset.code, asset.issuer),
  tx.amountIn!,
);

final transactionBuilder = flutter_sdk.TransactionBuilder(sourceAccount)
  ..addOperation(paymentBuilder.build());

flutter_sdk.Memo? memo;
if ("text" == tx.withdrawalMemoType) {
  memo = flutter_sdk.MemoText(tx.withdrawalMemo!);
} else if ("hash" == tx.withdrawalMemoType) {
  memo = flutter_sdk.MemoHash(base64Decode(tx.withdrawalMemo!));
} // ... etc.

if (memo != null) {
  transactionBuilder.addMemo(memo);
}

flutter_sdk.KeyPair kp =
  flutter_sdk.KeyPair.fromSecretSeed(userKeyPair.secretKey);
final transaction = transactionBuilder.build()..sign(kp, network);
final paymentResult = await sdk.submitTransaction(transaction);
```

</CodeExample>

Where `keypair` is the SEP-10 authenticated account. If you want to transfer funds from a different address, refer to [Changing Stellar Transfer Account](#changing-stellar-transfer-account) section.

Finally, let's track transaction status updates. In this example we simply check if the transaction has been completed:

<CodeExample>

```kt
var terminalStatus: TransactionStatus? = null

do {
  statusChange = withdrawalWatcher.channel.receive()

  when (statusChange) {
    is StatusChange -> {
      if (statusChange.status.isTerminal()) {
        terminalStatus = statusChange.status
      }
    }
    is ChannelClosed -> println("Transaction tracking finished")
    is ExceptionHandlerExit ->
      println("Retries exhausted trying obtain transaction data, giving up.")
  }
} while (statusChange !is ChannelClosed)

if (terminalStatus != TransactionStatus.COMPLETED) {
  println("Transaction was not completed")
}
```

```typescript
let watcher = anchor.sep24().watcher();

let onSuccess = (transaction) => {
  // transaction came back as completed / refunded / expired
  console.log("Transaction is completed");
};

let onError = (transaction) => {
  // runtime error, or the transaction comes back as
  // no_market / too_small / too_large / error
};

let { refresh, stop } = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final watcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(token, withdrawal.id)
watcher.controller.stream.listen(
  (event) {
    if (event is StatusChange && event.status.isTerminal()) {
      if (TransactionStatus.completed != event.status) {
        print("Transaction was not completed!");
      } else {
        print("Success");
      }
    } else if (event is ExceptionHandlerExit) {
      print("Retries exhausted trying obtain transaction data, giving up.");
    } else if (event is StreamControllerClosed) {
      print("Transaction tracking finished");
    }
  },
  onError: (error) {
    // handle error
  },
);
```
