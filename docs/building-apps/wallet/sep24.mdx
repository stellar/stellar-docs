The [SEP-24] standard defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users. Wallets use this standard to facilitate exchanges between on-chain assets (such as stablecoins) and off-chain assets (such as fiat, or other network assets such as BTC).

During the flow, a wallet makes several requests to the anchor, and finally receives an interactive URL to open in iframe. This URL is used by the user to provide an input (such as KYC) directly to the anchor. Finally, the wallet can fetch transaction information using query endpoints.

## Get Anchor Information

Let's start with getting an instance of `Interactive` class, responsible for all SEP-24 interactions:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val sep24 = anchor.sep24()
```

```typescript
let sep24 = await anchor.interactive();
```

```dart
// By providing the domain hosting the stellar.toml file
final transferService = await TransferServerSEP24Service.fromDomain("place.domain.com");

// Or by providing the service url
final transferService = TransferServerSEP24Service("http://api.stellar-anchor.org/transfer");
```

</CodeExample>

First, let's get the information about the anchor's support for [SEP-24]. This request doesn't require authentication, and will return generic info, such as supported currencies, and features supported by the anchor. You can get a full list of returned fields in the [SEP-24 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#info).

<CodeExample>

```kt
suspend fun getAnchorServices(): AnchorServiceInfo {
  return sep24.getServicesInfo()
}
```

```typescript
const getAnchorServices = async (): Promise<AnchorServiceInfo> => {
  anchor.getServicesInfo();
};
```

```dart
SEP24InfoResponse infoResponse = await transferService.info();
```

</CodeExample>

## Interactive Flows

Before getting started, make sure you have connected to the anchor and received an authentication token, as described in the [Stellar Authentication] wallet guide. We will use the `token` object in the examples below as the [SEP-10] authentication token, obtained earlier.

To initiate an operation, we need to know an asset. You may want to hard-code it, or get it dynamically from the anchor's info file, like shown above (for USDC):

<CodeExample>

```kt
val asset = info.currencies.first { it.code == "USDC" }.assetId
```

```typescript
const asset = info.currencies.find(({ code }) => code === "USDC").assetId;
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

Before starting with the deposit flow, make sure that the user account has [established a trustline](/docs/building-apps/wallet/stellar#modify-assets-trustlines) for the asset you are working with.

:::

### Basic Flow

Let's start with a basic deposit:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, token)
```

```typescript
let deposit = await anchor.interactive().deposit({
  accountAddress: accountKp.publicKey(),
  assetCode,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
SEP24DepositRequest request = new SEP24DepositRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.deposit(request);
```

</CodeExample>

As a result, you will get an [interactive response](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) from the anchor.

Open the received URL in an iframe and deposit the transaction ID for future reference:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val url = deposit.url
val id = deposit.id
```

```typescript
let url = deposit.url;
let id = deposit.id;
```

```dart
String url = response.url;
String id = response.id;
```

</CodeExample>

Similarly to the deposit flow, a basic withdrawal flow has the same method signature and repose type:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, token)
val url = withdrawal.url
val id = withdrawal.id
```

```typescript
let withdrawal = await anchor.interactive().withdraw({
  accountAddress: accountKp.publicKey(),
  assetCode,
  authToken,
});
let url = withdrawal.url;
let id = withdrawal.id;
```

```dart
SEP24WithdrawRequest request = new SEP24WithdrawRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.type = "bank_account";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.withdraw(request);
```

</CodeExample>

### Providing KYC Info

To improve the user experience, the [SEP-24] standard supports passing user KYC to the anchor via [SEP-9]. In turn, the anchor will pre-fill this information in the interactive popup.

:::info

While [SEP-9] supports passing binary data, the current version of the SDK doesn't offer such functionality.

:::

:::note

At the time, accepted [SEP-9] is not strictly typed yet. Improved typing will be offered in future versions.

:::

<CodeExample>

```kt
val sep9 = mapOf("email_address" to "mail@example.com")

val deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, token, sep9)
```

```typescript
let deposit = await anchor.interactive().deposit({
  accountAddress: accountKp.publicKey(),
  assetCode,
  authToken,
  extraFields: { email_address: "mail@example.com" },
});
```

```dart
SEP24DepositRequest request = new SEP24DepositRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

StandardKYCFields kycFields = StandardKYCFields();
kycFields.naturalPersonKYCFields = NaturalPersonKYCFields();
kycFields.naturalPersonKYCFields!.emailAddress = "mail@example.com";
kycFields.naturalPersonKYCFields!.photoIdFront = await Util.readFile(path);

request.kycFields = kycFields;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.deposit(request);
```

</CodeExample>

### Changing Stellar Transfer Account

By default, the Stellar transfer will be sent to the authenticated account (with a memo) that initiated the deposit.

While in most cases it's acceptable, some wallets may split their accounts. To do so, pass additional account (and optionally a memo):

<CodeExample>

```kt
suspend fun depositDifferentAccount(): InteractiveFlowResponse {
  val recipientAccount = "G..."
  val memo = "my memo" to MemoType.TEXT
  return sep24.deposit(asset, token, destinationAccount = recipientAccount, destinationMemo = memo)
}
```

```typescript
const recipientAccount = "G...";
// TODO: Add `memo` param when the SDK supports it
const depositDifferentAccount = async (): Promise<InteractiveFlowResponse> => {
  return anchor.interactive().deposit({
    accountAddress: accountKp.publicKey(),
    assetCode,
    authToken,
    fundsAccountAddress: recipientAccount,
  });
};
```

```dart
SEP24DepositRequest request = new SEP24DepositRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.account = "G...";
request.memo = "my memo";
request.memoType = "text";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.deposit(request);
```

</CodeExample>

Similarly, for a withdrawal, the origin account of the Stellar transaction could be changed:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val originAccount = "G..."
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, token, withdrawalAccount = originAccount)
```

```typescript
const originAccount = "G...";
const withdrawal = await anchor.interactive().withdraw({
  accountAddress: accountKp.publicKey(),
  assetCode,
  authToken,
  fundsAccountAddress: recipientAccount,
});
```

```dart
SEP24WithdrawRequest request = new SEP24WithdrawRequest();
request.account = "G...";
//...

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.withdraw(request);
```

</CodeExample>

## Getting Transaction Info

On the typical flow, the wallet would get transaction data to notify users about status updates. This is done via the [SEP-24] `GET /transaction` and `GET /transactions` endpoint.

Alternatively, some anchors support webhooks for notifications. Note that this feature is not widely adopted yet.

### Tracking Transaction

Let's look into how to use the wallet SDK to track transaction status changes. We will use `Watcher` class for this purpose. First, let's initialize watcher and start tracking a transaction.

<CodeExample>

```kt
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(token, "transaction id")
```

```typescript
let watcher = anchor.watcher();

let result = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});
```

</CodeExample>

Alternatively, we can track multiple transactions for the same asset.

<CodeExample>

```kt
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchAsset(getAuthToken(), asset)
```

</CodeExample>

Next, let's get the channel provided by `WatcherResult` to receive events.

<CodeExample>

```kt
do {
  val event = result.channel.receive()
  when (event) {
    is StatusChange ->
      println("Status changed to ${event.status}. Transaction: ${event.transaction}")
    is ExceptionHandlerExit -> println("Exception handler exited the job")
    is ChannelClosed -> println("Channel closed. Job is done")
  }
} while (event !is ChannelClosed)
```

</CodeExample>

This code example will consume all events coming from the channel until it's closed. There are three types of events:

- `StatusChange`: indicates that transaction status has changed.
- `ExceptionHandlerExit`: indicates that the exception handler exited the processing loop. With default retry handler it happens when retries are exhausted.
- `ChannelClosed`: indicates that the channel is closed and no more events will be emitted. This event will always fire. If `ExceptionHandlerExit` happened, channel will close right after. Otherwise, (under normal circumstances) it will stop when all transactions reach terminal statuses.

:::info

Events are stored in the channel until they are received, and calling the `receive()` method will block the channel until a message is received. You can read more about how channels work in the [channel documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-and-channels.html#channels).

:::

### Fetching Transaction

While `Watcher` class offers powerful tracking capabilities, sometimes it's required to just fetch a transaction (or transactions) once. The `Anchor` class allows you to fetch a transaction by ID, Stellar transaction ID, or external transaction ID:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val transaction = sep24.getTransactionBy(token, id = "transaction id")
```

```typescript
const transaction = await anchor.getTransactionBy({
  authToken,
  id: transactionId,
});
```

```dart
// single transaction
SEP24TransactionRequest request = SEP24TransactionRequest();
request.stellarTransactionId = "transaction id";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24TransactionResponse response = await transferService.transaction(request);
SEP24Transaction transaction  = response.transaction;

// multiple transactions
SEP24TransactionsRequest request = SEP24TransactionsRequest();
request.assetCode = "ETH";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24TransactionsResponse response = await transferService.transactions(request);
List<SEP24Transaction> transactions = response.transactions;
```

</CodeExample>

It's also possible to fetch transaction by the asset

<CodeExample>

```kt
val transactions = sep24.getTransactionsForAsset(asset, token)
```

```typescript
const transactions = await anchor.getTransactionsForAsset({
  authToken,
  assetCode,
});
```

```dart
SEP24TransactionsRequest request = SEP24TransactionsRequest();
request.assetCode = "ETH";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24TransactionsResponse response = await transferService.transactions(request);
List<SEP24Transaction> transactions = response.transactions;
```

</CodeExample>

## Submitting Withdrawal Transfer

Previously, we took a look at starting the withdrawal flow. Now, let's take a look at a full example.

First, start the withdrawal:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken = token)
```

</CodeExample>

Next, open an interactive url :

<CodeExample>

```kt
val url = withdrawal.url
// open the url
```

</CodeExample>

After that we need to wait until the anchor is ready to receive funds. To do so, we will be waiting until transaction reaches `pending_user_transfer_start` status

<CodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawalWatcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(token, withdrawal.id)
var statusChange: StatusUpdateEvent

// Wait for user input
do {
  statusChange = withdrawalWatcher.channel.receive()
} while (
  ((statusChange as? StatusChange) ?: throw Exception("Channel unexpectedly closed"))
    .status != TransactionStatus.PENDING_USER_TRANSFER_START
)
```

</CodeExample>

Next, sign and submit the Stellar transfer:

<CodeExample>

```kt
val anchorTransaction = (statusChange.transaction as WithdrawalTransaction)
val transfer = stellar.transaction(keypair).transferWithdrawalTransaction(anchorTransaction, asset).build()

transfer.sign(keypair)

stellar.submitTransaction(transfer)
```

</CodeExample>

Where `keypair` is the SEP-10 authenticated account. If you want to transfer funds from a different address, refer to [Changing Stellar Transfer Account](#changing-stellar-transfer-account) section.

Finally, let's track transaction status updates. In this example we simply check if the transaction has been completed:

<CodeExample>

```kt
var terminalStatus: TransactionStatus? = null

do {
  statusChange = withdrawalWatcher.channel.receive()

  when (statusChange) {
    is StatusChange -> {
      if (statusChange.status.isTerminal()) {
        terminalStatus = statusChange.status
      }
    }
    is ChannelClosed -> println("Transaction tracking finished")
    is ExceptionHandlerExit ->
      println("Retries exhausted trying obtain transaction data, giving up.")
  }
} while (statusChange !is ChannelClosed)

if (terminalStatus != TransactionStatus.COMPLETED) {
  println("Transaction was not completed")
}
```

</CodeExample>
