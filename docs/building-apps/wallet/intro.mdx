:::info

This guide is available on two different programming languages: Typescript and Kotlin. You can change the shown on each page via the buttons above.

## Installation

First, you need to add the SDK dependency to your project.

<LanguageSpecific kt={<KtInstall />} ts={<TsInstall />} />

## Working with the SDK

Let's start with the main class that provides all SDK functionality. It's advised to have a singleton wallet object shared across the application. Creating a wallet with a default configuration connected to Stellar's Testnet is simple:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val wallet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration.Testnet)
```

```ts
let wallet = walletSdk.Wallet.TestNet();
```

</CodeExample>

The wallet instance can be further configured. For example, to connect to the public network:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val walletMainnet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration(Network.PUBLIC, "https://horizon.stellar.org"))
```

```typescript
let wallet = new Wallet({
  stellarConfiguration: StellarConfiguration.MainNet(),
});
```

</CodeExample>

There is one more available configuration for a wallet that allows it to configure internal logic of the SDK. For example, to test with local servers on an HTTP protocol, HTTP can be manually enabled.

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val walletCustom = Wallet(
  StellarConfiguration.Testnet,
  ApplicationConfiguration { defaultRequest { url { protocol = URLProtocol.HTTP } } }
)
```

</CodeExample>

### Configuring the Client

The Kotlin wallet SDK uses the [ktor client](https://ktor.io/docs/getting-started-ktor-client.html) for all network requests (excluding Horizon, where the Stellar SDK's HTTP client is used). Currently, the okhttp engine is configured to be used with the client. You can read more about how to configure the ktor client [here](https://ktor.io/docs/create-client.html#configure-client).

The Typescript wallet SDK uses the [axios client](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for all network requests. You can read more about how to configure the axios client [here](https://axios-http.com/docs/instance).

For example, the client can be globally configured:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val walletCustomClient =
  Wallet(
    StellarConfiguration.Testnet,
    ApplicationConfiguration(
      defaultClientConfig = {
        engine { this.config { this.connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10)) } }
        install(HttpRequestRetry) {
          retryOnServerErrors(maxRetries = 5)
          exponentialDelay()
        }
      }
    )
  )
```

```typescript
const customClient: AxiosInstance = axios.create({
  timeout: 1000,
});
let appConfig = new ApplicationConfiguration(DefaultSigner, customClient);
let wal = new Wallet({
  stellarConfiguration: StellarConfiguration.TestNet(),
  applicationConfiguration: appConfig,
});
```

</CodeExample>

This Kotlin code will set the connect timeout to ten seconds via the [okhttp configuration](https://ktor.io/docs/http-client-engines.html#okhttp) and also installs the [retry plugin](https://ktor.io/docs/client-retry.html). You can also specify client configuration for specific wallet SDK classes.

In Typescript, we can use axios to [configure](https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config) the timeout in milliseconds.

For example, to change connect timeout when connecting to some anchor server:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val anchorCustomClient =
  walletCustomClient.anchor("example.com") {
    engine { this.config { this.connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) } }
  }
```

```typescript
const customClient: AxiosInstance = axios.create({
  timeout: 10000,
});
let appConfig = new ApplicationConfiguration(DefaultSigner, customClient);
let wal = new Wallet({
  stellarConfiguration: StellarConfiguration.TestNet(),
  applicationConfiguration: appConfig,
});
```

</CodeExample>

### Closing Resources

After the wallet class is no longer used, it's necessary to close all clients used by it. While in some applications it may not be required (e.g. the wallet lives for the whole lifetime of the application), in other cases it can be required. If your wallet class is short-lived, it's recommended to close client resources using a close function:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
fun closeWallet() {
  wallet.close()
}
```

</CodeExample>

## Stellar Basics

The wallet SDK provides some extra functionality on top of the existing [Horizon SDK]. For interaction with the Stellar network, the wallet SDK covers only the basics used in a typical wallet flow. For more advanced use cases, the underlying [Horizon SDK] should be used instead.

To interact with the Horizon instance configured in the previous steps, simply do:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val stellar = wallet.stellar()
```

</CodeExample>

This example will create a Stellar class that manages the connection to Horizon service.

:::note

Default configuration connects to the public Stellar Horizon instance. You can change this behavior as described [above](#working-with-the-sdk).

:::

You can read more about working with the Stellar network in the [respective section](./stellar.mdx).

## Anchor Basics

Primary use of the SDK is to provide an easy way to connect to anchors via sets of protocols known as SEPs. Let's look into connecting to the Stellar test anchor:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val anchor = wallet.anchor("https://testanchor.stellar.org")
```

```typescript
let anchor = wallet.anchor({ homeDomain: "testanchor.stellar.org" });
```

</CodeExample>

And the most basic interaction of fetching a [SEP-1]: Stellar Info File:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
suspend fun anchorToml(): TomlInfo {
  return anchor.getInfo()
}
```

```typescript
let resp = await anchor.getInfo();
```

</CodeExample>

The anchor class also supports [SEP-10]: Stellar Authentication and [SEP-24]: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal features.
