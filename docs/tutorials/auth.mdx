The [auth example] demonstrates how to implement authentication and
authorization using the Soroban Host-managed auth framework.

This example is an extension of the [storing data example].

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][oigp]
[oigp]: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0

[storing data example]: ../getting-started/storing-data.mdx
[auth example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/auth

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v20.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v20.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `auth` directory, and use
`cargo test`.

```
cd auth
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="auth/src/lib.rs"
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Counter(Address),
}

#[contract]
pub struct IncrementContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementContract {
    /// Increment increments a counter for the user, and returns the value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env, user: Address, value: u32) -> u32 {
        // Requires `user` to have authorized call of the `increment` of this
        // contract with all the arguments passed to `increment`, i.e. `user`
        // and `value`. This will panic if auth fails for any reason.
        // When this is called, Soroban host performs the necessary
        // authentication, manages replay prevention and enforces the user's
        // authorization policies.
        // The contracts normally shouldn't worry about these details and just
        // write code in generic fashion using `Address` and `require_auth` (or
        // `require_auth_for_args`).
        user.require_auth();

        // This call is equilvalent to the above:
        // user.require_auth_for_args((&user, value).into_val(&env));

        // The following has less arguments but is equivalent in authorization
        // scope to the above calls (the user address doesn't have to be
        // included in args as it's guaranteed to be authenticated).
        // user.require_auth_for_args((value,).into_val(&env));

        // Construct a key for the data being stored. Use an enum to set the
        // contract up well for adding other types of data to be stored.
        let key = DataKey::Counter(user.clone());

        // Get the current count for the invoker.
        let mut count: u32 = env.storage().persistent().get(&key).unwrap_or_default();

        // Increment the count.
        count += value;

        // Save the count.
        env.storage().persistent().set(&key, &count);

        // Return the count to the caller.
        count
    }
}
```

## How it Works

The example contract stores a per-`Address` counter that can only be incremented
by the owner of that `Address`.

Open the `auth/src/lib.rs` file or see the code above to follow along.

### `Address`

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Counter(Address),
}
```

`Address` is a universal Soroban identifier that may represent a Stellar
account, a contract or an 'account contract' (a contract that defines a custom
authentication scheme and authorization policies). Contracts don't need to
distinguish between these internal representations though. `Address` can be
used any time some network identity needs to be represented, like to
distinguish between counters for different users in this example.

:::tip Enum keys like `DataKey` are useful for organizing contract storage.

Different enum values create different key 'namespaces'.

In the example the counter for each address is stored against
`DataKey::Counter(Address)`. If the contract needs to start storing other types
of data, it can do so by adding additional variants to the enum.
:::

### `require_auth`

```rust
impl IncrementContract {
    pub fn increment(env: Env, user: Address, value: u32) -> u32 {
        user.require_auth();
```

`require_auth` method can be called for any `Address`. Semantically
`user.require_auth()` here means 'require `user` to have authorized calling
`increment` function of the current `IncrementContract` instance with the
current call arguments, i.e. the current `user` and `value` argument values'.
In simpler terms, this ensures that the `user` has allowed incrementing their
counter value and nobody else can increment it.

When using `require_auth` the contract implementation doesn't need to worry
about the signatures, authentication, and replay prevention. All these features
are implemented by the Soroban host and happen automatically as long as the
`Address` type is used.

`Address` has another method called `require_auth_for_args`. It works in the
same fashion as `require_auth`, but allows customizing the arguments that need
to be authorized. Note though, this should be used with care to ensure that
there is a deterministic mapping between the contract invocation arguments and
the `require_auth_for_args` arguments.

The following two calls are functionally equivalent to `user.require_auth`:

```rust
// Completely equivalent
user.require_auth_for_args((&user, value).into_val(&env));
// The following has less arguments but is equivalent in authorization
// scope to the above call (the user address doesn't have to be
// included in args as it's guaranteed to be authenticated).
user.require_auth_for_args((value,).into_val(&env));
```

### Tests

Open the [`auth/src/test.rs`] file to follow along.

[`auth/src/test.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/auth/src/test.rs

```rust title="auth/src/test.rs"
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let user_1 = Address::random(&env);
    let user_2 = Address::random(&env);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &5), 5);
    // Verify that the user indeed had to authorize a call of `increment` with
    // the expected arguments:
    assert_eq!(
        env.auths(),
        [(
            // Address for which auth is performed
            user_1.clone(),
            // Identifier of the called contract
            contract_id.clone(),
            // Name of the called function
            symbol_short!("increment"),
            // Arguments used to call `increment` (converted to the env-managed vector via `into_val`)
            (user_1.clone(), 5_u32).into_val(&env)
        )]
    );

    // Do more `increment` calls. It's not necessary to verify authorizations
    // for every one of them as we don't expect the auth logic to change from
    // call to call.
    assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &2), 7);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_2, &1), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &3), 10);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_2, &4), 5);
}

```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The test instructs the environment to mock all auths. All calls to
`require_auth` or `require_auth_for_args` will succeed.

```rust
env.mock_all_auths();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`IncrementContract`, and the client is named `IncrementContractClient`.

```rust
let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
```

Generate `Address`es for two users. Normally the exact value of the `Address`
shouldn't matter for testing, so they're simply generated randomly.

```rust
let user_1 = Address::random(&env);
let user_2 = Address::random(&env);
```

Invoke `increment` function for `user_1`.

```rust
assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &5), 5);
```

In order to verify that the `require_auth` call(s) have indeed happened, use
`auths` function that returns a vector of tuples containing the authorizations
from the most recent contract invocation.

```rust
assert_eq!(
    env.auths(),
    [(
        // Address for which auth is performed
        user_1.clone(),
        // Identifier of the called contract
        contract_id.clone(),
        // Name of the called function
        symbol_short!("increment"),
        // Arguments used to call `increment` (converted to the env-managed vector via `into_val`)
        (user_1.clone(), 5_u32).into_val(&env)
    )]
);
```

Invoke `increment` function several more times for both users. Notice, that the
values are tracked separately for each users.

```rust
assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &2), 7);
assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_2, &1), 1);
assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &3), 10);
assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_2, &4), 5);
```

## Build the Contract

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `soroban contract build` command.

```sh
soroban contract build
```

The `.wasm` file should be found in the `target` directory after building:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke functions on the contract.

But since we are dealing with authorization and signatures, we need to set up
some identities to use for testing and get their public keys:

```sh
soroban config identity generate acc1 && \
soroban config identity generate acc2 && \
soroban config identity address acc1 && \
soroban config identity address acc2
```

Example output with two public keys of identities:

```
GA6S566FD3EQDUNQ4IGSLXKW3TGVSTQW3TPHPGS7NWMCEIPBOKTNCSRU
GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B
```

Now the contract itself can be invoked. Notice the `--source` must be the
identity name matching the address passed to the `--user` argument. This allows
`soroban` tool to automatically sign the necessary payload for the invocation.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --source acc1 \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment \
    --user GA6S566FD3EQDUNQ4IGSLXKW3TGVSTQW3TPHPGS7NWMCEIPBOKTNCSRU \
    --value 2
```

Run a few more increments for both accounts.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --source acc2 \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment \
    --user GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B \
    --value 5
```

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --source acc1 \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment \
    --user GA6S566FD3EQDUNQ4IGSLXKW3TGVSTQW3TPHPGS7NWMCEIPBOKTNCSRU \
    --value 3
```

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --source acc2 \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment \
    --user GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B \
    --value 10
```

View the data that has been stored against each user with `soroban contract read`.

```sh
soroban contract read --id 1
```

```
"[""Counter"",""GA6S566FD3EQDUNQ4IGSLXKW3TGVSTQW3TPHPGS7NWMCEIPBOKTNCSRU""]",5
"[""Counter"",""GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B""]",15
```

It is also possible to preview the authorization payload that is being signed by
providing `--auth` flag to the invocation:

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --source acc2 \
    --auth \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment \
    --user GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B \
    --value 123
```

```json
Contract auth: [{"address_with_nonce":null,"root_invocation":{"contract_id":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","function_name":"increment","args":[{"object":{"address":{"account":{"public_key_type_ed25519":"c7bab0288753d58d3e21cc3fa68cd2546b5f78ae6635a6f1b3fe07e03ee846e9"}}}},{"u32":123}],"sub_invocations":[]},"signature_args":[]}]
