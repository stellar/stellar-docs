The [deployer example] demonstrates how to deploy contracts using a contract.

Here we deploy a contract on behalf of any address and initialize it
atomically.

:::info

In this example there are two contracts that are compiled separately, and the
tests deploy one with the other.

:::

[deployer example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/deployer

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v20.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v20.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `deployer/deployer`
directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd deployer/deployer
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="deployer/deployer/src/lib.rs"
#[contract]
pub struct Deployer;

#[contractimpl]
impl Deployer {
    /// Deploy the contract Wasm and after deployment invoke the init function
    /// of the contract with the given arguments.
    ///
    /// This has to be authorized by `deployer` (unless the `Deployer` instance
    /// itself is used as deployer). This way the whole operation is atomic
    /// and it's not possible to frontrun the contract initialization.
    ///
    /// Returns the contract address and result of the init function.
    pub fn deploy(
        env: Env,
        deployer: Address,
        wasm_hash: BytesN<32>,
        salt: BytesN<32>,
        init_fn: Symbol,
        init_args: Vec<Val>,
    ) -> (Address, Val) {
        // Skip authorization if deployer is the current contract.
        if deployer != env.current_contract_address() {
            deployer.require_auth();
        }

        // Deploy the contract using the uploaded Wasm with given hash.
        let deployed_address = env
            .deployer()
            .with_address(deployer, salt)
            .deploy(wasm_hash);

        // Invoke the init function with the given arguments.
        let res: Val = env.invoke_contract(&deployed_address, &init_fn, init_args);
        // Return the contract ID of the deployed contract and the result of
        // invoking the init result.
        (deployed_address, res)
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Contracts can deploy other contracts using the SDK `deployer()` method.

The contract address of the deployed contract is deterministic and is derived from
the address of the deployer. The deployment also has to be authorized by the
deployer.

Open the `deployer/deployer/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Contract Wasm Upload

Before deploying the new contract instances, the Wasm code needs to be uploaded
on-chain. Then it can be used to deploy an arbitrary number of contract
instances. The upload should typically happen outside of the deployer
contract, as it needs to happen just once. However, it is possible to use
`env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm()` function to upload Wasm from a contract
as well.

See the [tests](#tests) for an example of uploading the contract code
programmatically. For the actual on-chain installation see the general deployment
[tutorial](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/deploy-to-testnet).

### Authorization

:::info

This section can be skipped for factory contracts that deploy another contract
from their own address (`deployer == env.current_contract_address()``).

:::

:::info

For introduction to Soroban authorization see the [auth tutorial](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/tutorials/auth)

:::

We start with verifying authorization of the `deployer`, unless its the current
contract (at which point the authorization is implied).

```rust
if deployer != env.current_contract_address() {
    deployer.require_auth();
}
```

While `deployer().with_address()` performs authorization as well, we want to
make sure that `deployer` has also authorized the whole operation,
as besides deployment it also performs atomic contract initialization. If we
didn't require deployer authorization here, then it would be possible to
frontrun the deployment operation performed by `deployer` and initialize it
differently, thus breaking the promise of atomic initialization.

See more details on the actual authorization payloads in [tests](#tests).

### `deployer()`

The `deployer()` SDK function comes with a few deployment-related utilities.
Here we use the most generic deployer kind, `with_address(deployer_address, salt)`.

```rust
let deployed_address = env
    .deployer()
    .with_address(deployer, salt)
    .deploy(wasm_hash);
```

`with_address()` accepts the `deployer` address and salt. Both are used to derive the
address of the deployed contract deterministically. It is not possible to
re-deploy an already existing contract.

`deploy()` function performs the actual deployment using the provided `wasm_hash`.
The implementation of the new contract is defined by the Wasm file uploaded under
`wasm_hash`.

:::tip

Only the `wasm_hash` itself is stored per contract ID thus saving
the ledger space and fees.

:::

When only deploying the contract on behalf of the current contract, i.e. when
`deployer` address is always `env.current_contract_address()` it is possible
to use `deployer().with_current_contract(salt)` function for brevity.

### Initialization

The contract can be called immediately after deployment, which is useful for
initialization.

```rust
let res: Val = env.invoke_contract(&deployed_address, &init_fn, init_args);
```

`invoke_contract` can call any defined contract function with any arguments. We
pass the actual function to call and the arguments from `deploy` inputs. The
result can be any value, depending on the `init_fn`'s return value.

If the initialization fails, then the whole `deploy` call falls and thus the
contract won't be deployed. This behavior is required for the atomic
initialization guarantee as well.

The contract returns the deployed contract's address and the result of executing
the initialization function.

```rust
 (deployed_address, res)
```

### Tests

Open the `deployer/deployer/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

Import the test contract Wasm to be deployed.

```rust
// The contract that will be deployed by the deployer contract.
mod contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file =
            "../contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm"
    );
}
```

That contract contains the following code that exports two functions:
initialization function that takes a value and a getter function for the stored
initialized value.

```rust title="deployer/contract/src/lib.rs"
#[contract]
pub struct Contract;

const KEY: Symbol = symbol_short!("value");

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn init(env: Env, value: u32) {
        env.storage().instance().set(&KEY, &value);
    }
    pub fn value(env: Env) -> u32 {
        env.storage().instance().get(&KEY).unwrap()
    }
}
```

This test contract will be used when testing the deployer. The deployer contract
will deploys the test contract and invoke its `init` function.

There are two tests: deployment from the current contract without authorization
and deployment from an arbitrary address with authorization. Besides
authorization, these tests are very similar.

#### Curent contract deployer

In the first test we deploy contract from the `Deployer` contract instance
itself.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_deploy_from_contract() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let deployer_client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &env.register_contract(None, Deployer));

    // Upload the Wasm to be deployed from the deployer contract.
    // This can also be called from within a contract if needed.
    let wasm_hash = env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(contract::WASM);

    // Deploy contract using deployer, and include an init function to call.
    let salt = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    let init_fn = symbol_short!("init");
    let init_fn_args: Vec<Val> = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
    let (contract_id, init_result) = deployer_client.deploy(
        &deployer_client.address,
        &wasm_hash,
        &salt,
        &init_fn,
        &init_fn_args,
    );

    assert!(init_result.is_void());
    // No authorizations needed - the contract acts as a factory.
    assert_eq!(env.auths(), vec![]);

    // Invoke contract to check that it is initialized.
    let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let sum = client.value();
    assert_eq!(sum, 5);
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Register the deployer contract with the environment and create a client to for
it.

```rust
let deployer_client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &env.register_contract(None, Deployer));
```

Upload the code of the test contract that we have imported above via
`contractimport!` and get the hash of the uploaded Wasm code.

```rust
let wasm_hash = env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(contract::WASM);
```

The client is used to invoke the `deploy` function. The contract will deploy the
test contract using the hash of its Wasm code, call the `init` function, and
pass in a single `5u32` argument. The expected return value of `init` function
is just `void` (i.e. no value).

```rust
let salt = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
let init_fn = symbol_short!("init");
let init_fn_args: Vec<Val> = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
let (contract_id, init_result) = deployer_client.deploy(
    &deployer_client.address,
    &wasm_hash,
    &salt,
    &init_fn,
    &init_fn_args,
);
```

The test checks that the test contract was deployed by using its client to
invoke it and get back the value set during initialization.

```rust
let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
let sum = client.value();
assert_eq!(sum, 5);
```

#### External deployer

The second test is very similar to the first one.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_deploy_from_address() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let deployer_client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &env.register_contract(None, Deployer));

    // Upload the Wasm to be deployed from the deployer contract.
    // This can also be called from within a contract if needed.
    let wasm_hash = env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(contract::WASM);

    // Define a deployer address that needs to authorize the deployment.
    let deployer = Address::random(&env);

    // Deploy contract using deployer, and include an init function to call.
    let salt = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    let init_fn = symbol_short!("init");
    let init_fn_args: Vec<Val> = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
    env.mock_all_auths();
    let (contract_id, init_result) =
        deployer_client.deploy(&deployer, &wasm_hash, &salt, &init_fn, &init_fn_args);

    assert!(init_result.is_void());

    let expected_auth = AuthorizedInvocation {
        // Top-level authorized function is `deploy` with all the arguments.
        function: AuthorizedFunction::Contract((
            deployer_client.address,
            symbol_short!("deploy"),
            (
                deployer.clone(),
                wasm_hash.clone(),
                salt,
                init_fn,
                init_fn_args,
            )
                .into_val(&env),
        )),
        // From `deploy` function the 'create contract' host function has to be
        // authorized.
        sub_invocations: vec![AuthorizedInvocation {
            function: AuthorizedFunction::CreateContractHostFn(CreateContractArgs {
                contract_id_preimage: ContractIdPreimage::Address(ContractIdPreimageFromAddress {
                    address: deployer.clone().try_into().unwrap(),
                    salt: Uint256([0; 32]),
                }),
                executable: xdr::ContractExecutable::Wasm(xdr::Hash(wasm_hash.into_val(&env))),
            }),
            sub_invocations: vec![],
        }],
    };
    assert_eq!(env.auths(), vec![(deployer, expected_auth)]);

    // Invoke contract to check that it is initialized.
    let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let sum = client.value();
    assert_eq!(sum, 5);
}
```

The main difference is that the contract is deployed on behalf of the arbitrary
address.

```rust
// Define a deployer address that needs to authorize the deployment.
let deployer = Address::random(&env);
```

Before invoking the contract we need to enable mock authorization in order to
get the recorded authorization payload that we can verify.

```rust
env.mock_all_auths();
let (contract_id, init_result) =
        deployer_client.deploy(&deployer, &wasm_hash, &salt, &init_fn, &init_fn_args);
```

The expected authorization tree for the `deployer` looks as follows.

```rust
let expected_auth = AuthorizedInvocation {
    // Top-level authorized function is `deploy` with all the arguments.
    function: AuthorizedFunction::Contract((
        deployer_client.address,
        symbol_short!("deploy"),
        (
            deployer.clone(),
            wasm_hash.clone(),
            salt,
            init_fn,
            init_fn_args,
        )
            .into_val(&env),
    )),
    // From `deploy` function the 'create contract' host function has to be
    // authorized.
    sub_invocations: vec![AuthorizedInvocation {
        function: AuthorizedFunction::CreateContractHostFn(CreateContractArgs {
            contract_id_preimage: ContractIdPreimage::Address(ContractIdPreimageFromAddress {
                address: deployer.clone().try_into().unwrap(),
                salt: Uint256([0; 32]),
            }),
            executable: xdr::ContractExecutable::Wasm(xdr::Hash(wasm_hash.into_val(&env))),
        }),
        sub_invocations: vec![],
    }],
};
```

At the top level we have the `deploy` function itself with all the arguments
that we've passed to it. From the `deploy` function the `CreateContractHostFn`
has to be authorized. This is the authorization payload that has to be
authorized by any deployer in any context. It contains the deployer address,
salt and executable.

This authorization tree proves that the deployment and initialization are
authorized atomically: actual deployment happens within the context of `deploy`
and all of salt, executable, and initialization arguments are authorized
together (i.e. there is one signature to authorizes this exact combination).

Then we make sure that deployer has authorized the expected tree and that
expected value has been stored.

```rust
assert_eq!(env.auths(), vec![(deployer, expected_auth)]);

let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
let sum = client.value();
assert_eq!(sum, 5);
```

## Build the Contracts

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `soroban contract build` command. Build
both the deployer contract and the test contract.

```sh
soroban contract build
```

Both `.wasm` files should be found in both contract `target` directories after building
both contracts:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_contract.wasm
```

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke the contract function to
deploy the test contract.

Before deploying the test contract with the deployer, install the test contract
Wasm using the `install` command. The `install` command will print out the
hash derived from the Wasm file (it's not just the hash of the Wasm file itself
though) which should be used by the deployer.

```sh
soroban contract install --wasm contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm
```

The command prints out the hash as hex. It will look something like `7792a624b562b3d9414792f5fb5d72f53b9838fef2ed9a901471253970bc3b15`.

We also need to deploy the `Deployer` contract:

```sh
soroban contract deploy --wasm deployer/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_contract.wasm --id 1
```

This will return the deployer address: `CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD2KM`.

Then the deployer contract may be invoked with the Wasm hash value above.

```sh
soroban contract invoke --id 1 -- deploy \
    --deployer CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD2KM
    --salt 123 \
    --wasm_hash 7792a624b562b3d9414792f5fb5d72f53b9838fef2ed9a901471253970bc3b15 \
    --init_fn init \
    --init_args '[{"u32":5}]'
```

And then invoke the deployed test contract using the identifier returned from
the previous command.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --id ead19f55aec09bfcb555e09f230149ba7f72744a5fd639804ce1e934e8fe9c5d \
    -- \
    value
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
5
```
