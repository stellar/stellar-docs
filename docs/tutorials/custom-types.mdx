The [custom types example] demonstrates how to define your own data structures
that can be stored on the ledger, or used as inputs and outputs to contract
invocations.

[custom types example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/custom_types

## Run the example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the examples repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `custom_types` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd custom_types
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="custom_types/src/lib.rs"
#[contracttype]
pub enum Name {
    None,
    FirstLast(FirstLast),
}

#[contracttype]
pub struct FirstLast {
    pub first: Symbol,
    pub last: Symbol,
}

pub struct CustomTypesContract;

const NAME: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("NAME");

#[contractimpl]
impl CustomTypesContract {
    pub fn store(env: Env, name: Name) {
        env.contract_data().set(NAME, name);
    }

    pub fn retrieve(env: Env) -> Name {
        env.contract_data()
            .get(NAME) // Get the value associated with key NAME.
            .unwrap_or(Ok(Name::None)) // If no value, use None instead.
            .unwrap()
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Custom types are defined using the `#[contracttype]` attribute on either a
`struct` or an `enum`.

Open the `custom_types/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Custom Type: Struct

Structs are stored on ledger as a map of key-value pairs, where the key is a 10
character string representing the field name, and the value is the value
encoded.

Field names must be no more than 10 characters.

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct FirstLast {
    pub first: Symbol,
    pub last: Symbol,
}
```

### Custom Type: Enum

Structs are stored on ledger as a two element vector, where the first element is
the name of the enum variant as a string up to 10 characters in length, and the
value is the value if the variant has one.

Only unit variants and single value variants, like `Red` and `Blue` below, are
supported.

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum Name {
    None,
    FirstLast(FirstLast),
}
```

### Using Structs and Enums in Functions

Types that have been annotated with `#[contracttype]` can be used as inputs and
outputs on contract functions, and the values can be stored as contract data and
retrieved later.

```rust
pub struct CustomTypesContract;

const NAME: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("NAME");

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl CustomTypesContract {
    pub fn store(env: Env, name: Name) {
        env.contract_data().set(NAME, name);
    }

    pub fn retrieve(env: Env) -> Name {
        env.contract_data()
            .get(NAME) // Get the value associated with key NAME.
            .unwrap_or(Ok(Name::None)) // If no value, use None instead.
            .unwrap()
    }
}
```

## Tests

Open the `custom_types/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="custom_types/src/test.js"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_id, CustomTypesContract);

    assert_eq!(retrieve::invoke(&env, &contract_id), Name::None);

    store::invoke(
        &env,
        &contract_id,
        &Name::FirstLast(FirstLast {
            first: Symbol::from_str("first"),
            last: Symbol::from_str("last"),
        }),
    );

    assert_eq!(
        retrieve::invoke(&env, &contract_id),
        Name::FirstLast(FirstLast {
            first: Symbol::from_str("first"),
            last: Symbol::from_str("last"),
        }),
    );
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Host environment that the contract will run it.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contracts must be registered with the environment with a contract ID, which is a
32-byte value.

```rust
let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have an `invoke` function generated, that can be
used to invoke the contract function within the environment.

The test invokes the `retrieve` function on the registered contract, and asserts
that it returns `Name::None`.

```rust
assert_eq!(retrieve::invoke(&env, &contract_id), Name::None);
```

The test then invokes the `store` function on the registered contract, to change
the name that is stored.

```rust
store::invoke(
    &env,
    &contract_id,
    &Name::FirstLast(FirstLast {
        first: Symbol::from_str("first"),
        last: Symbol::from_str("last"),
    }),
);
```

The test invokes the `retrieve` function again, to assert that it returns the
name that was previously stored.

```rust
assert_eq!(
    retrieve::invoke(&env, &contract_id),
    Name::FirstLast(FirstLast {
        first: Symbol::from_str("first"),
        last: Symbol::from_str("last"),
    }),
);
```

## Build WASM

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_custom_types_contract.wasm
```

## Run the WASM

The `soroban-cli` is in early development and does not yet accept user-defined
types as arguments at the command line. Follow the GitHub repository to find out
