title: Run on Sandbox
---

If you have the [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can run contracts in a local
sandbox environment.

The Soroban sandbox environment is the same Soroban environment that runs on
Stellar networks, but it runs without nodes, and without the other features you
find on a Stellar network.

:::info
It's also possible to run a contract on a fully featured local network.  See
[Deploy to a Local Network] for more details.
:::

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract] and the resulting `.wasm` file
we built in [Build] run the following command to invoke the `hello`
function with a single argument `friend`.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```

[Write a Contract]: write-a-contract
[Deploy to a Local Network]: deploy-to-local-network
[Build]: build
[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli
