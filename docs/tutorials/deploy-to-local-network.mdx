title: Deploy to a Local Network
---

If you have Docker installed, you can run a local standalone network with the
[Stellar Quickstart] Docker image.

The Quickstart image is a single container that runs everything you need to test
against a fully featured network. It contains:

- Stellar Core – Node software that runs the network, coordinates consensus, and
finalizes ledgers.
- Soroban RPC server – JSON RPC server for interacting with Soroban contracts.
- Horizon server – HTTP API for access ledger state and historical transactions.
- Friendbot server – HTTP API for creating and funding new accounts on test
networks.

:::info
It's also possible to run a contract in the local sandbox environment without a
network using just the [`soroban-cli`]. See [Run on Sandbox] for more details.
:::

To run a local standalone network with the Stellar Quickstart Docker image,
run the following command.

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --name stellar \
  stellar/quickstart:soroban-dev \
  --standalone \
  --enable-soroban-rpc
```

Once the image is started you can check its status by querying the Horizon API:
```sh
curl http://localhost:8000
```

Generate a key for use on the local sandbox environment by going to the [Stellar
Laboratory]. Make note of both the `G...` and `S...` keys. The `G...` key is the
public key and will also be the account ID. The `S...` key is the secret key and
is that you use to control the account.

:::tip
It's a good practice to never use the same keys for testing and development that
you use do for the public Stellar network. Generate new keys for testing and
development and avoid ever using them for other purposes.
:::

Create an account on the local sandbox environment by making a request to the
local Friendbot. Specify as the `addr` the `G...` key of your account.

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/?addr=G...
```

Once you have an account on the network, we'll use the code we wrote in [Write a
Contract] and the resulting `.wasm` file we built in [Build] as our contract to
deploy. Run the following commands to deploy the contract to the network. Use
the `S...` key as the secret key.

```sh
soroban deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    --secret-key S... \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc \
    --network-passphrase 'Standalone Network ; February 2017'
```

:::tip
It's good practice to avoid entering secret keys on the command line. You can
also specify the secret key by setting the environment variable
`SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY`. The [`soroban-cli`] is still in development and in the
future there will be other secure ways to provide a secret key, such as via
hardware keys.
:::

A contract ID will be outputted.

```
cd4dae2c409c433b1e1d83994a20214d3e5f60bdd3a817978d8aa7c797864313
```

Using the contract ID that was outputted, use the [`soroban-cli`] to invoke the
`hello` function with a single argument `friend`.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --id cd4dae2c409c433b1e1d83994a20214d3e5f60bdd3a817978d8aa7c797864313 \
    --secret-key S... \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc \
    --network-passphrase 'Standalone Network ; February 2017' \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```
