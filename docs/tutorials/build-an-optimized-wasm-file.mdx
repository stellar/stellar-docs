title: Build an Optimized WASM File
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Building optimized WASM files requires some additional options and commands, and
requires installing the `nightly` Rust toolchain and `wasm-opt`.

:::info
Building optimized WASM is only necessary when deploying to network or when
analyzing the real size of a contract. It is otherwise not required during
initial development.
:::

## Install Rust `nightly`

To install the nightly Rust toolchain use `rustup`.

```sh
rustup install nightly
```

## Install `wasm-opt`

To install `wasm-opt`, install `binaryen`. Depending on your operating system
there may be different ways to install it.

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

```sh
brew install binaryen
```

For distributions that use `apt`:

```sh
sudo apt install binaryen
```

For other distributions see:

## Building with `nightly` and `wasm-opt`

Then build your contract using nightly, and the additional options that remove
unnecessary information from the contract.

```sh
cargo +nightly build \
    --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --release \
    -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
    -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```

Then additionally use `wasm-opt` to further minimize the size of the `.wasm`.

```sh
wasm-opt -Oz \
    target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm \
    -o target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project-optimized.wasm
```
