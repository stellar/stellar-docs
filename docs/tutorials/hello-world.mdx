title: Hello World

The [hello world example] demonstrates how to write a simple contract, with a
single function that takes one input and returns it as an output.

[hello world example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/hello_world

## Run the example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the examples repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `hello_world` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd hello_world
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="hello_world/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct HelloContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl HelloContract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        const GREETING: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("Hello");
        vec![&env, GREETING, to]
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Soroban contracts export all public functions that are within `impl` blocks that
have been annotated with `#[contractimpl]`. In the example above the contract
exports a single function, `hello`.

Contract functions must be given names that are no more than 10 characters long.

Open the `hello_world/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Contract Type

Contract functions must be defined within an `impl` block, and therefore a type
is required for the impl to be attached. A simple zero-sized struct can be used.

```rust
pub struct HelloContract;
```

### Contract Function

Contract functions look much like regular Rust functions. They mave have any
number of arguments, but arguments must support being transmitted to and from
the Host environment that the contract runs in. The Soroban SDK provides some
types like `Symbol`, `Vec`, `Map`, `Binary`, `FixedBinary`, etc that can be
used. Primitive values like `u64`, `i64`, `u32`, `i32`, and `bool` can also be
used. Floats are not supported.

Contract inputs must not be references.

If the first argument of a contract function is of the `soroban_sdk::Env` type,
an `Env` will be provided that provides access to Host functionality. Most
functionality within the SDK requires an Env, so it is recommended to have it in
the argument list for most functions.

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl HelloContract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Tests

Open the `hello_world/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="hello_world/src/test.js"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);

    let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("SourBun"));
    assert_eq!(
        words,
        vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("SourBun"),]
    );
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Host environment that the contract will run it.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contracts must be registered with the environment with a contract ID, which is a
32-byte value.

```rust
let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have an `invoke` function generated, that can be
used to invoke the contract function within the environment.

```rust
let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("SourBun"));
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:
```rust
assert_eq!(
    words,
    vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("SourBun"),]
);
```

## Build WASM

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_hello_world_contract.wasm
```

## Run the WASM

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
WASM using it.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --file ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_hello_world_contract.wasm \
    --contract-id 1
    --fn hello
    --arg friend
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```
