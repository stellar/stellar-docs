Writing tests for Soroban contracts involves writing Rust code using the test
facilities and toolchain that you'd use for testing any Rust code.

Given a simple contract like the contract demonstrated in [Write a
Contract](write-a-contract.mdx), a simple test will look like this.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lib.rs" label="src/lib.rs">

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), to]
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="test.rs" label="src/test.rs" default>

```rust
#![cfg(test)]

use super::{Contract, ContractClient};
use soroban_sdk::{symbol, vec, BytesN, Env};

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
    let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let words = client.hello(&symbol!("Dev"));
    assert_eq!(
        words,
        vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), symbol!("Dev"),]
    );
}
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run inside of.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type.
Contracts can specify a fixed contract ID as the first argument, or provide
`None` and one will be generated.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`Contract`, and the client is named `ContractClient`.

```rust
let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
let words = client.hello(&symbol!("Dev"));
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:
```rust
assert_eq!(
    words,
    vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), symbol!("Dev"),]
);
```

## Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.
