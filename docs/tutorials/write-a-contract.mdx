title: Write a Contract
---

Once you have a project setup, like how we setup a project in [Create a Project], writing a contract involves writing Rust code in
the projects `lib.rs` file.

```rust
#![no_std]
```

All contracts should begin with `#![no_std]` to ensure that the Rust standard
library is not included in the build. The Rust standard library is large and not
well suited to being deployed into small programs like those deployed to
blockchains.

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};
```

The contract will need to import the types and macros that it needs from the
`soroban-sdk` crate. Take a look at [Create a Project] to see
how to setup a project.

Many of the types available in typical Rust programs, such as `std::vec::Vec`,
are not available, as there is no allocator and no heap memory in Soroban
contracts. The `soroban-sdk` provides a variety of types like `Vec`, `Map`,
`Bytes`, `BytesN`, `Symbol`, that all utilize the Soroban environment's memory
and native capabilities.

```rust
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

Contract functions live inside an `impl` for a struct. The `impl` block is
annotated with `#[contractimpl]`. Functions that are intended to be called
externally should be marked with `pub` visibility. The first argument can be
an `Env` argument to get a copy of the Soroban environment, which is necessary
for most things.

Putting those pieces together a simple contract will look like this.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), to]
    }
}
```
