To build a Soroban contract to deploy or run, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file will be outputted in the `target` directory. The `.wasm` file is
the built contract.

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm
```

The `.wasm` file contains the logic of the contract, as well as a the contracts
specification that can be imported into other contracts who wish to call it.
This is the only artifact needed to deploy the contract, share the interface
with others, or integration test against the contract.
