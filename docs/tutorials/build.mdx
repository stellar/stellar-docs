To build a Soroban contract to deploy or run, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

:::tip

Use the `release` profile outlined in [Configure the Release Profile], otherwise
the contract will exceed Soroban's size limits.

:::

A `.wasm` file will be outputted in the `target` directory. The `.wasm` file is
the built contract.

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm
```

The `.wasm` file contains the logic of the contract, as well as the contract's
specification that can be imported into other contracts who wish to call it.
This is the only artifact needed to deploy the contract, share the interface
with others, or integration test against the contract.

:::tip

To further optimize builds to be as small as possible, see [Optimizing Builds].
