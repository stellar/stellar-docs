To build a Soroban contract to deploy or run, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

:::tip
It is highly recommended to use the `release` profile outlined in [Configure the
Release Profile], otherwise the contract will exceed Soroban's size limits.
:::

A `.wasm` file will be outputted in the `target` directory. The `.wasm` file is
the built contract.

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm
```

The `.wasm` file contains the logic of the contract, as well as a the contracts
specification that can be imported into other contracts who wish to call it.
This is the only artifact needed to deploy the contract, share the interface
with others, or integration test against the contract.

Building optimized contracts to be as small as possible requires some additional
tools, and requires installing the `nightly` Rust toolchain and `wasm-opt`.

Building optimized contracts is only necessary when deploying to a network with
fees or when analyzing and profiling a contract to get it as small as possible.
If you're just starting out writing a contract, these steps are not necessary.

[Configure the Release Profile]: create-a-project#configure-the-release-profile

## Install Rust `nightly`

To install the nightly Rust toolchain use [`rustup`].

[`rustup`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-rust

```sh
rustup install nightly
rustup target add --toolchain nightly wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup component add --toolchain nightly rust-src
```

## Install `wasm-opt`

To install `wasm-opt`, install [`binaryen`]. Depending on your operating system
there may be different ways to install it.

[`binaryen`]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen

```sh
brew install binaryen
```

For distributions that use `apt`:

```sh
sudo apt install binaryen
```

For other distributions see:

## Build with `nightly` and `wasm-opt`

Build your contract using nightly. The additional options instruct the compiler
to remove unnecessary information from the contract.

```sh
cargo +nightly build \
    --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --release \
    -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
    -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```

Use `wasm-opt` to further minimize the size of the `.wasm`.

```sh
wasm-opt -Oz \
    target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    -o target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project_optimized.wasm
```
