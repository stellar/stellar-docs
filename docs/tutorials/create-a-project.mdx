title: Create a Project
---

Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create Soroban contracts. Creating projects is done using the Rust tool, `cargo`.

[setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

Create a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Configure the Library Type

Add the `crate-type` configuration, required for building contracts.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

## Import `soroban-sdk` and Features

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`, and configure a set of features explained below.

:::caution 

The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues [here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose). 

:::

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.0.4"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.0.4", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]
```

The `features` list includes a `testutils` feature, which will cause additional test utilities to be generated for calling the contract in tests.

:::info 

The `testutils` test utilities are automatically enabled inside [Rust unit tests] inside the same crate as your contract. If you write [Rust integration tests], or write tests from another crate, you'll need to add `#[cfg(feature = "testutils")]` to those tests and enable the `testutils` feature when running your tests with `cargo test --features testutils` to be able to use those test utilities. 

:::

## Configure the `release` Profile

Configuring the `release` profile to optimize the contract build is critical. Soroban contracts have a maximum size of 256KB. Rust programs, even small ones, without these configurations almost always exceed this size.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

## Wrapping it Up

The steps below should produce a `Cargo.toml` that looks like so.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.0.4"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.0.4", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```
