title: Create a Project
---

Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create Soroban
contracts. Creating projects is done using the Rust tool, `cargo`.

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

Create a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.2.1"
edition = "2021"
```

## Configure the Library Type

Add the `crate-type` configuration, required for building contracts.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

## Import `soroban-sdk` and Features

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the
`soroban-sdk`, and configure a set of features explained below.

:::caution
The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).
:::

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.2.1"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.2.1", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]
```

The `features` list includes a `testutils` feature, which will cause additional
test utilities to be generated for calling the contract in tests.

:::info
The `testutils` test utilities are automatically enabled inside [Rust unit
tests] inside the same crate as your contract. If you write tests from another
crate, you'll need to require the `testutils` feature for those tests and enable
the `testutils` feature when running your tests with `cargo test
--features testutils` to be able to use those test utilities.
:::

## Configure the `release` Profile

Configuring the `release` profile to optimize the contract build is critical.
Soroban contracts have a maximum size of 256KB. Rust programs, even small ones,
without these configurations almost always exceed this size.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` and use the `release` profile when
building.

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

## Configure the `release-with-logs` Profile

Configuring a `release-with-logs` profile can be useful for if you need to build
a `.wasm` that has logs enabled for printing debug logs when using the
[`soroban-cli`].  Note that this is not necessary to access debug logs in tests
or to use a step-through-debugger.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` and use the `release-with-logs` profile
when you need logs.

```toml
[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```

See the [logging example] for more information about how to log.

[logging example]: ../examples/logging.mdx

## Wrapping it Up

The steps below should produce a `Cargo.toml` that looks like so.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.2.1"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.2.1", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true

[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```
