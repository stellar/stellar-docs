Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create your
first Soroban contract.

[Setup]: setup.mdx

Start by creating a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "first-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Add `soroban-sdk` Dependency

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`.

:::caution
The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk).
:::

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
default = ["export"]
export = []
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk", rev = "32b76650" }

[dev_dependencies]
first-project = { path = ".", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

The `features` list and `dev_dependencies` configure three variations that the
contract can be built with:
- By `default`, with `export` enabled, contract functions will be exported and
available to be invoked when the contract is deployed.
- Optionally without `export` enabled, contract functions will not be exported.
Types will be still exposed, which is useful when developing multiple contracts
together and this contract is to be imported into another but its functions are
not intended to be invoked.
- And `testutils` which will cause additional test utilities to be generated for
calling the contract in tests. The library itself is added as a `dev_dependencies`
so that whenever its tests are running the `testutils` feature is enabled.

The config for the `release` profile configures the Rust toolchain to produce
smaller contracts.
