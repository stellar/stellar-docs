title: Create a Project
---

Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create Soroban
contracts. Creating projects is done using the Rust tool, `cargo`.

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

Create a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Configure the Library Type

Add the `crate-type` configuration, required for building contracts.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

## Import `soroban-sdk` and Features

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the
`soroban-sdk`, and configure a set of features explained below.

:::caution
The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).
:::

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.0.3"

[dev_dependencies]
project-name = { path = ".", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
default = ["export"]
export = []
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]
```

The `features` list and `dev_dependencies` configure three variations that the
contract can be built with:
- By `default`, with `export` enabled, contract functions will be exported and
available to be invoked when the contract is deployed.
- Optionally without `export` enabled, contract functions will not be exported.
Types will be still exposed, which is useful when developing multiple contracts
together and this contract is to be imported into another but its functions are
not intended to be invoked.
- And `testutils` which will cause additional test utilities to be generated for
calling the contract in tests. The library itself is added as a `dev_dependencies`
so that whenever its tests are running the `testutils` feature is enabled.

## Configure the `release` Profile

Configuring the `release` profile to optimize the contract build is critical.
Soroban contracts have a maximum size of 256KB. Rust programs, even small ones,
without these configurations almost always exceed this size.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

## Wrapping it Up

The steps below should produce a `Cargo.toml` that looks like so.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.0.3"

[dev_dependencies]
project-name = { path = ".", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
default = ["export"]
export = []
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```
