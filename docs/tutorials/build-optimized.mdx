Building optimized contracts to be as small as possible requires some additional tools, and requires installing the `nightly` Rust toolchain and `wasm-opt`.

:::info Building optimized contracts is only necessary when deploying to network or when analyzing and profiling a contract to get it as small as possible. If you're just starting out writing a contract, these steps are not necessary. :::

:::info All contracts are optimized to some degree by the project's `release` profile. It is highly recommended to use the release profile outlined in [Configure the Release Profile], otherwise the contract will be too large to deploy or run. :::

[configure the release profile]: create-a-project#configure-the-release-profile

## Install Rust `nightly`

To install the nightly Rust toolchain use `rustup`.

```sh
rustup install nightly
rustup target add --toolchain nightly wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup component add --toolchain nightly rust-src
```

## Install `wasm-opt`

To install `wasm-opt`, install `binaryen`. Depending on your operating system there may be different ways to install it.

```sh
brew install binaryen
```

For distributions that use `apt`:

```sh
sudo apt install binaryen
```

## Building with `nightly` and `wasm-opt`

Then build your contract using nightly, and the additional options that remove unnecessary information from the contract.

```sh
cargo +nightly build \
    --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --release \
    -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
    -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```

Then additionally use `wasm-opt` to further minimize the size of the `.wasm`.

```sh
wasm-opt -Oz \
    target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    -o target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project-optimized.wasm
```
