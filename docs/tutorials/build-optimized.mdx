Building optimized contracts to be as small as possible requires some additional
tools, and requires installing the `nightly` Rust toolchain and `wasm-opt`.

:::tip
Building optimized contracts is only necessary when deploying to a network with
fees or when analyzing and profiling a contract to get it as small as possible.
If you're just starting out writing a contract, these steps are not necessary.
See [Build] for details on how to build for development.

[Build]: build.mdx

### Install Rust `nightly`

To install the nightly Rust toolchain use [`rustup`].

[`rustup`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-rust

```sh
rustup install nightly
rustup target add --toolchain nightly wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup component add --toolchain nightly rust-src
```

### Install `wasm-opt`

To install `wasm-opt`, install [`binaryen`]. Depending on your operating system
there may be different ways to install it.

[`binaryen`]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

```sh
brew install binaryen
```

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

For distributions that use `apt`:

```sh
sudo apt install binaryen
```

For other distributions see:

### Build with `nightly` and `wasm-opt`

Build your contract using nightly. The additional options instruct the compiler
to remove unnecessary information from the contract.

```sh
cargo +nightly build \
    --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --release \
    -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
    -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```

Use `wasm-opt` to further minimize the size of the `.wasm`.

```sh
wasm-opt -Oz \
    target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    -o target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project_optimized.wasm
```
