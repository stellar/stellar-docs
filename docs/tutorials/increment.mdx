The [increment example] demonstrates how to write a simple contract, with a
single function that increments an internal counter and returns the value.

[increment example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/increment

## Run the example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the examples repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `increment` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd increment
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="increment/src/lib.rs"
const COUNTER: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("COUNTER");

pub struct IncrementContract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl IncrementContract {
    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> u32 {
        let mut count: u32 = env
            .contract_data()
            .get(COUNTER)
            .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
            .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.
        count += 1;
        env.contract_data().set(COUNTER, count);
        count
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Open the `hello_world/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Contract Data Keys

Contract data that is stored is stored associated with a key. The key is the
value that can be used at a later time to lookup the value.

`Symbol`s are a space and execution efficient value to use as static keys. When
produced in a `const` variable they are computed at compile time and stored in
code as a 64-bit value. Their maximum character length is 10.

```rust
const COUNTER: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("COUNTER");
```

### Contract Data Access

The `Env` `contract_data()` function is used to retrieve access and update a
counter. The executing contract is the only contract that can query or modify
contract data that it has stored. The data stored is viewable on ledger anywhere
the ledger is viewable, but contracts executing within the Host environment are
restricted to their own data.

The `get()` function gets the current value associated with the counter key.

```rust
let mut count: u32 = env
    .contract_data()
    .get(COUNTER)
    .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
    .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.
```

If no value is currently stored, the value given to `unwrap_or(...)` is returned
instead.

Values stored as contract data and retrieved are transmitted from the host and
expanded into the type specified. In this case a `u32`. If the value can be
expanded the type returned will be an `Ok(u32)`, otherwise the type returned
will be an `Err(_)`. The final `unwrap()` in the above code snippet is assuming
the value will always be a u32. If a developer caused it to be some other type a
panic would occur at the unwrap.

The `set()` function stores the new count value against the key, replacing the
existing value.

```rust
env.contract_data().set(COUNTER, count);
```

## Tests

Open the `increment/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="increment/src/test.js"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_id, IncrementContract);

    let count = increment::invoke(&env, &contract_id);
    assert_eq!(count, 1);

    let count = increment::invoke(&env, &contract_id);
    assert_eq!(count, 2);

    let count = increment::invoke(&env, &contract_id);
    assert_eq!(count, 3);
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Host environment that the contract will run it.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contracts must be registered with the environment with a contract ID, which is a
32-byte value.

```rust
let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have an `invoke` function generated, that can be
used to invoke the contract function within the environment.

```rust
let count = increment::invoke(&env, &contract_id);
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:
```rust
assert_eq!(count, 1);
```

## Build WASM

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm
```

## Run the WASM

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
WASM using it.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --file ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm \
    --contract-id 1
    --fn increment
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```
1
```

Run it a few more times to watch the count change.
