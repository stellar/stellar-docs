title: Deploy to Futurenet
---

If you have Docker installed, you can run a local node with the [Stellar
Quickstart] Docker image that joins the [Futurenet] network, and then use that
local node to deploy.

[Futurenet]: ../networks/futurenet

:::info
It's also possible to run a contract in the local sandbox environment without a
network using just the [`soroban-cli`]. See [Run on Sandbox] for more details.
:::

To run a local node for the [Futurenet] network with the Stellar Quickstart
Docker image, run the following command.

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --name stellar \
  stellar/quickstart:soroban-dev@sha256:8046391718f8e58b2b88b9c379abda3587bb874689fa09b2ed4871a764ebda27 \
  --futurenet \
  --enable-soroban-rpc
```

Once the image is started you can check its status by querying the Horizon API:
```sh
curl http://localhost:8000
```

It takes sometime to join a remote network. Monitor the output of that endpoint
until you see the `core_latest_ledger` become a number above zero.

Generate a key by going to the [Stellar Laboratory]. Make note of both the
`G...` and `S...` keys. The `G...` key is the public key and will also be the
account ID. The `S...` key is the secret key and is that you use to control the
account.

:::tip
It's a good practice to never use the same keys for testing and development that
you use for the public Stellar network. Generate new keys for testing and
development and avoid ever using them for other purposes.
:::

Create an account on the [Futurenet] network by making a request to the
Friendbot. Specify as the `addr` the `G...` key of your account.

```sh
curl "https://friendbot-futurenet.stellar.org/?addr=G..."
```

Once you have an account on the network, we'll use the code we wrote in [Write a
Contract] and the resulting `.wasm` file we built in [Build] as our contract to
deploy. Run the following commands to deploy the contract to the network. Use
the `S...` key as the secret key.

```sh
soroban deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm \
    --secret-key S... \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022'
```

:::tip
It's good practice to avoid entering secret keys on the command line. You can
also specify the secret key by setting the environment variable
`SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY`. The [`soroban-cli`] is still in development and in the
future there will be other secure ways to provide a secret key, such as via
hardware keys.
:::

A contract ID will be outputted.

```
cd4dae2c409c433b1e1d83994a20214d3e5f60bdd3a817978d8aa7c797864313
```

Using the contract ID that was outputted, use the [`soroban-cli`] to invoke the
`hello` function with a single argument `friend`.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --id cd4dae2c409c433b1e1d83994a20214d3e5f60bdd3a817978d8aa7c797864313 \
    --secret-key S... \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```
