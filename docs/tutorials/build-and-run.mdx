## Build a Contract

To build a Soroban contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm
```

## Run a Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in a
WASM file.

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract] and the the resulting `.wasm` file
we built in [Build and Run] run the following command to invoke the `hello`
function with a single argument `"friend"`.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --file target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm \
    --contract-id 1
    --fn hello
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```

[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli
[Write a Contract]: write-a-contract
[Build and Run]: build-and-run
