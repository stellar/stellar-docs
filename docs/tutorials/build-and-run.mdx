## Build a Contract

To build a Soroban contract to deploy or run with the [`soroban-cli`], use the
`cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file will be outputted in the `target` directory. The `.wasm` file is
the built contract.

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project_name].wasm
```

## Run a Contract

If you have the [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions
that have been built.

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract] and the resulting `.wasm` file
we built in [Build and Run] run the following command to invoke the `hello`
function with a single argument `friend`.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```

[Write a Contract]: write-a-contract
[Build and Run]: build-and-run
[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban
