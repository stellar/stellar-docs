The [token example] demonstrates how to write a token contract that implements
the [Token Interface].

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][oigp]

[oigp]: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0
[token example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/token
[Token Interface]: ../tokens/token-interface.mdx

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v20.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

```bash
git clone -b v20.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in
[Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `hello_world` directory, and
use `cargo test`.

```bash
cd token
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```bash
running 8 tests
test test::initialize_already_initialized - should panic ... ok
test test::transfer_spend_deauthorized - should panic ... ok
test test::decimal_is_over_max - should panic ... ok
test test::test_burn ... ok
test test::transfer_receive_deauthorized - should panic ... ok
test test::transfer_from_insufficient_allowance - should panic ... ok
test test::transfer_insufficient_balance - should panic ... ok
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

:::note

The source code for this [token example] is broken into several smaller modules.
This is a common design pattern for more complex smart contracts.

## How it Works

Tokens created on a smart contract platform can take many different forms,
include a variety of different functionalities, and meet very different needs or
use-cases. While each token can fulfill a unique niche, there are some "normal"
features that almost all tokens will need to make use of (e.g., payments,
transfers, balance queries, etc.). In an effort to minimize repetition and
streamline token deployments, Soroban implements the [Token Interface], which
provides a uniform, predictable interface for developers and users.

Creating a Soroban token from an existing Stellar asset is very easy, and the
wrapped token makes use of the [Stellar Asset Contract] (more on that [later]).
This example contract, however, demonstrates how a smart contract token might be
constructed that doesn't take advantage of the Stellar Asset Contract, but does
still satisfy the commonly used Token Interface to maximize interoperability.

[Stellar Asset Contract]: ../tokens/stellar-asset-contract.mdx
[later]: #compatibility-with-stellar-assets

### Separation of Functionality

You have likely noticed that this example contract is broken into discrete
modules, with each one responsible for a siloed set of functionality. This
common practice helps to organize the code and make it more maintainable.

For example, most of the token logic exists in the `contract.rs` module.
Functions like `mint`, `burn`, `transfer`, etc. are written and programmed in
that file. The Token Interface describes how some of these functions should emit
events when they occur. However, keeping all that event-emitting logic bundled
in with the rest of the contract code could make it harder to track what is
happening in the code, and that confusion could ultimately lead to errors.

Instead, we have a separate `events.rs` module that takes away all the headache
of emitting events when other functions run. Here is the function to emit an
event whenever the token is minted:

```rust
pub(crate) fn mint(e: &Env, admin: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    let topics = (symbol_short!("mint"), admin, to);
    e.events().publish(topics, amount);
}
```

Admittedly, this is a simple example, but constructing the contract this way
makes it very clear to the developer what is happening and where. This function
is then used by the `contract.rs` module whenever the `mint` function is
invoked:

```rust
// earlier in `contract.rs`
use crate::event;

fn mint(e: Env, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    check_nonnegative_amount(amount);
    let admin = read_administrator(&e);
    admin.require_auth();
    receive_balance(&e, to.clone(), amount);
    // highlight-next-line
    event::mint(&e, admin, to, amount);
}
```

This same convention is used to separate from the "main" contract code the
metadata for the token, the storage type definitions, etc.

### Standardized Interface, Customized Behavior

This example contract follows the standardized [Token Interface], implementing
all of the same functions as the [Stellar Asset Contract]. This gives wallets,
users, developers, etc. a predictable interface to interact with the token. Even
though we are implementing the same _interface_ of functions, that doesn't mean
we have to implement the same _behavior_ inside those functions. While this
example contract doesn't actually modify any of the functions that would be
present in a deployed instance of the Stellar Asset Contract, that possibility
remains open to the contract developer.

By way of example, perhaps you have an NFT project, and the artist wants to have
a small royalty paid every time their token transfers hands:

```rust
// This is mainly the `transfer` function from `src/contract.rs`
fn transfer(e: Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    from.require_auth();

    check_nonnegative_amount(amount);
    spend_balance(&e, from.clone(), amount);
    // highlight-start
    // We calculate some new amounts for payment and royalty
    let payment = (amount * 997) / 1000;
    let royalty = amount - payment
    receive_balance(&e, artist.clone(), royalty);
    // highlight-end
    receive_balance(&e, to.clone(), payment);
    event::transfer(&e, from, to, amount);
}
```

The `transfer` interface is still in use, and is still the same as other tokens,
but we've customized the behavior to address a specific need. Another use-case
might be a tightly controlled token that requires authentication from an admin
before any `transfer`, `allowance`, etc. function could be invoked.

:::tip

Of course, you will want your token to behave in an _intuitive_ and
_transparent_ manner. If a user is invoking a `transfer`, they will expect
tokens to move. If an asset issuer needs to invoke a `clawback` they will likely
_require_ the right kind of behavior to take place.

:::

### Compatibility with Stellar Assets

One of the key benefits of the Stellar network is that assets are first-class
citizens. On a protocol level, asset issuers have a robust set of tools to
manage the authorization and behavior of assets. Any asset that already exists
on the Stellar network can also make use of the [Stellar Asset Contract] on the
Soroban platform. All that is required is a simple, one-time action of wrapping
the asset to be deployed for Soroban.

At that point, the asset can use all the features of the Stellar Asset Contract
that are highlighted in this example (allowance, mint, burn, etc.), while still
maintaining the high-quality asset issuer features included with Stellar.

Additionally, all of that comes with **no contract writing required**. Any asset
can be easily wrapped using the [Soroban-CLI]:

```bash
soroban lab token wrap \
    --asset USDC:GCYEIQEWOCTTSA72VPZ6LYIZIK4W4KNGJR72UADIXUXG45VDFRVCQTYE
```

:::note

A Stellar asset could be wrapped for Soroban by _any_ user. This command will
set the asset issuer account as the `admin` address for the Soroban token,
meaning that issuer account will still maintain control over asset minting,
authorization, etc.

The token example implements eight different tests to cover a wide array of
potential behaviors and problems. However, all of the tests start with a few
common pieces. In any test, the first thing that is always required is an `Env`,
which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let e = Env::default();
```

We mock authentication checks in the tests, which allows the tests to proceed as
if all users/addresses/contracts/etc. had successfully authenticated.

```rust
e.mock_all_auths();
```

We're also using a `create_token` function to ease the repetition of having to
register and initialize our token contract. The resulting `token` client is then
used to invoke the contract during each test.

```rust
// It is defined at the top of the file...
fn create_token<'a>(e: &Env, admin: &Address) -> TokenClient<'a> {
    let token = TokenClient::new(e, &e.register_contract(None, Token {}));
    token.initialize(admin, &7, &"name".into_val(e), &"symbol".into_val(e));
    token
}

// ... and it is used inside each test
let token = create_token(&e, &admin);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that has been annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute will have a corresponding function in the test's
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract, the contract type is
named `Token`, and the client type is named `TokenClient`.

The eight tests created for this example contract test a range of possible
conditions and ensure the contract responds appropriately to each one:

- **`test()`** - This function makes use of a variety of the built-in token
  functions to test the "predictable" way an asset might be interacted with by a
  user, as well as an administrator.
- **`test_burn()`** - This function ensures a `burn()` invocation decreases a
  user's balance, and that a `burn_from()` invocation decreases a user's balance
  as well as consuming another user's allowance of that balance.
- **`transfer_insufficient_balance()`** - This function ensures a `transfer()`
  invocation panics when the `from` user doesn't have the balance to cover it.
- **`transfer_receive_deauthorized()`** - This function ensures a user who is
  specifically de-authorized to hold the token cannot be the beneficiary of a
  `transfer()` invocation.
- **`transfer_spend_deauthorized()`** - This function ensures a user with a
  token balance, who is subsequently de-authorized cannot be the source of a
  `transfer()` invocation.
- **`transfer_from_insufficient_allowance()`** - This function ensures a user
  with an existing allowance for someone else's balance cannot make a
  `transfer()` greater than that allowance.
- **`initialize_already_initialized()`** - This function checks that the
  contract cannot have it's `initialize()` function invoked a second time.
- **`decimal_is_over_max()`** - This function tests that invoking `initialize()`
  with too high of a decimal precision will not succeed.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `soroban contract build` command.

```bash
soroban contract build
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```bash
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions using
it.

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    balance \
    --id GBZV3NONYSUDVTEHATQO4BCJVFXJO3XQU5K32X3XREVZKSMMOZFO4ZXR
```
