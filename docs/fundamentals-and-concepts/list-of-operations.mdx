Operations are objects that represent a desired change to the ledger and are submitted to the network grouped in a transaction. For each operation, there is a successful or failed result type. In the case of success, the user can gather information about the effect of the operation. In the case of failure, the user can learn more about the error.

Learn more about transactions and operations in our [Transaction and Operations section](./stellar-data-structures/operations-and-transactions).

There are currently 23 operations you can use on the Stellar network, these operations, their definitions, SDKs, thresholds, parameters, and errors are listed below.

## Set trustline flags

Allows issuing account to configure authorization and trustline flags to an asset

The Asset parameter is of the `TrustLineAsset` type. If you are modifying a trustline to a regular asset (i.e. one in a Code:Issuer format), this is equivalent to the Asset type. If you are modifying a trustline to a pool share, however, this is composed of the liquidity pool's unique ID.

Learn more about flags: [Flags Encyclopedia Entry](../encyclopedia/flags)

**Threshold**: Low  
**Parameters**:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trustor | account ID | The account that established this trustline. |
| Asset | TrustLineAsset | The asset trustline whose flags are being modified. |
| SetFlags | integer | One or more flags (combined via bitwise-OR) indicating which flags to set. Possible flags are: 1 if the trustor is authorized to transact with the asset or 2 if the trustor is authorized to maintain offers but not to perform other transactions. |
| ClearFlags | integer | One or more flags (combined via bitwise OR) indicating which flags to clear. Possibilities include those for SetFlagsas well as 4, which prevents the issuer from clawing back its asset (both from accounts and claimable balances). |

**Errors**:

| Error | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_MALFORMED | -1 | This can happen for a number of reasons: the asset specified by AssetCode and AssetIssuer is invalid; the asset issuer isn't the source account; the Trustor is the source account; the native asset is specified; or the flags being set/cleared conflict or are otherwise invalid. |
| SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_NO_TRUST_LINE | -2 | The Trustor does not have a trustline with the issuer performing this operation. |
| SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_CANT_REVOKE | -3 | The issuer is trying to revoke the trustline authorization of Trustor, but it cannot do so because AUTH_REVOCABLE_FLAG is not set on the account. |
| SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_INVALID_STATE | -4 | If the final state of the trustline has both AUTHORIZED_FLAG (1) and AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG (2) set, which are mutually exclusive. |
| SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_LOW_RESERVE | -5 | Claimable balances can't be created on revocation of asset (or pool share) trustlines associated with a liquidity pool due to low reserves. |

## Liquidity pool deposit

Deposits assets into a liquidity pool, increasing the reserves of a liquidity pool in exchange for pool shares

Parameters to this operation depend on the ordering of assets in the liquidity pool: “A” refers to the first asset in the liquidity pool, and “B” refers to the second asset in the liquidity pool.

If the pool is empty, then this operation deposits maxAmountA of A and maxAmountB of B into the pool. If the pool is not empty, then this operation deposits at most maxAmountA of A and maxAmountB of B into the pool. The actual amounts deposited are determined using the current reserves of the pool. You can use these parameters to control a percentage of slippage.

## Liquidity pool withdraw
