The Stellar Asset Contract is an implementation of [CAP-46-6 Smart Contract Standardized Asset].

[CAP-46-6 Smart Contract Standardized Asset]: https://stellar.org/protocol/cap-46-06

## Overview

Stellar has numerous assets on its classic network, and being able to use them
in Soroban would give users much more flexibility with how they can use their
assets. For this reason, we introduced the Stellar Asset Contract, or SAC for
short, which allows users to use their Stellar account and trustline balances in
Soroban.

The SAC implements the [token interface](token-interface.mdx), which is similar to the
widely used ERC-20 token standard. This should make it easier for existing
smart contract developers to get started on Stellar.

## Deployment

For every Stellar asset exactly one respective Stellar Asset Contract can be
deployed. It can be deployed using the `InvokeHostFunctionOp` with
`HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT` and `CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET` specified
[here](../soroban-internals/contract-interactions/stellar-transaction.mdx). The resulting token will have a
deterministic identifier, which will be the sha256 hash of
`HashIDPreimage::ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET` xdr specified [here][contract_id].

Anyone can deploy the instances of Stellar Asset Contract. Note, that the
initialization of the Stellar Asset Contracts happens automatically during the
deployment. Asset Issuer will have the administrative permissions after the
contract has been deployed.

## Interacting with classic Stellar assets

The Stellar Asset Contract is the only way to interact with 'classic' Stellar
assets in Soroban. 'Classic' assets include native Stellar token (lumens) and
all the existing trustlines.

The issuer of the asset will be the administrator
of the deployed contract. Because the Native Stellar token doesn't have an
issuer, it will not have an administrator either. It also cannot be burned.

After the contract has been deployed, users can use their classic account (for
lumens) or trustline (for other assets) balance. There are some differences
depending on if you are using a classic account `Address` vs a contract
`Address` (corresponding either to a regular contract or to a custom account
contract). The following section references some issuer and trustline flags from
Stellar classic, which you can learn more about [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/issuing-assets/control-asset-access#controlling-access-to-an-asset-with-flags).

- Using `Address::Account`
  - The balance must exist in a trustline (or an account for the native
    balance). This means the contract will not store the balance in
    ContractData. If the trustline or account is missing, any function that
    tries to interact with that balance will fail.
  - Classic trustline semantics will be followed.
    - Transfers will only succeed if the corresponding trustline(s) have the
      `AUTHORIZED_FLAG` set.
    - A trustline balance can only be clawed back using the `clawback` contract
      function if the trustline has `TRUSTLINE_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` set.
    - The admin can only deauthorize a trustline if the issuer of the asset has
      `AUTH_REVOCABLE_FLAG` set. The deauthorization will fail if the issuer is
      missing. Note that when a trustline is deauthorized from Soroban,
      `AUTHORIZED_FLAG` is cleared and
      `AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG` is set to avoid having to pull
      offers and redeeming pool shares.
    - Transfers to the issuer account will burn the token, while transfers from
      the issuer account will mint.
    - Trustline balances are stored in a 64-bit signed integer even though the
      interface accepts 128-bit signed integers. Any operation that attempts to
      send or receive an amount more than the maximum amount that can be
      represented by a 64-bit signed integer will fail.
- Using `Address::Contract`
  - The balance and authorization state will be stored in contract storage, as
    opposed to a trustline.
  - `AUTH_REVOCABLE_FLAG` is not required to be set on the issuer to deauthorize a
    balance.
  - Balances are stored in a 128-bit signed integer.
  - A balance can only be clawed back if the issuer account had the
    `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` set when the balance was created. A balance is
    created when either an `Address::Contract` is on the receiving end of a successful
    transfer, or if the admin sets the authorization state. Read more
    about `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/issuing-assets/control-asset-access#clawback-enabled-0x8).

### Balance Authorization Required

In the `Address::Contract` case, if the issuer has `AUTH_REQUIRED_FLAG` set, then the
specified `Address::Contract` will need to be explicitly authorized with
`set_auth` before it can receive a balance. This logic lines up with how
trustlines interact with the `AUTH_REQUIRED_FLAG` issuer flag, allowing asset issuers
to have the same control in Soroban as they do in Stellar classic. Read more
about `AUTH_REQUIRED_FLAG` [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/issuing-assets/control-asset-access#authorization-required-0x1).

## Authorization semantics

See the [authorization overview](../soroban-internals/authorization.mdx) and
[auth example](../tutorials/auth.mdx) for general information about authorization in
Soroban.

The token contract contains three kinds of operations that follow the token
[interface](token-interface.mdx#code):

- getters, such as `balance`, which do not change the state of the contract
- unprivileged mutators, such as `incr_allow` and `xfer`, which change the state
  of the contract but do not require special privileges
- privileged mutators, such as `clawback` and `set_admin`, which change the
  state of the contract but require special privileges

Getters require no authorization because they do not change the state of the
contract and all contract data is public. For example, `balance` simply returns
the balance of the specified `Address` without changing it.

Unprivileged mutators require authorization from the `Address` that spends or
allows spending their balance. The exceptions are `xfer_from` and `burn_from`
operations where the `Address` that require authorization from the 'spender'
entity that has got an allowance from another `Address` beforehand.

Priviliged mutators require authorization from a specific privileged identity,
known as the "administrator". For example, only the administrator can `mint`
more of the token. Similarly, only the administrator can appoint a new
administrator.

## Using Stellar Asset Contract with other contracts

From the contract perspective Stellar Asset Contract is not different from any
other token that implements the Soroban token interface. The Rust SDK contains
a pregenerated client for any contract that implements the token interface:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::token;

struct MyContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl MyContract {
  fn token_fn(e: Env, token_id: BytesN<32>) {
    // Create a client instance for the provided token identifier. If the
    // `token_id` value corresponds to an SAC contract, then SAC implementation
    // is used.
    let client = token::Client::new(&env, &token_id);
    // Call token operations.
    client.transfer(...);
  }
}
```

### Examples

See the full examples that utilize the token contract in various ways for more
details:

- [Timelock](../tutorials/timelock.mdx) and [single offer](../tutorials/single-offer-sale.mdx) move token
  via `xfer` to and from the contract
- [Atomic swap](../tutorials/atomic-swap.mdx) uses `incr_allow` to transfer token on behalf
  of the user

Notice, that these examples don't do anything to support SAC specifically.

### Testing

Soroban Rust SDK provides an easy way to instantiate a Stellar Asset Contract
tokens using `register_stellar_asset_contract`. For example:

```rust
let admin = Address::random();
let user = Address::random();
let token = TokenClient::new(e, &e.register_stellar_asset_contract(admin.clone()));
token.mint(&admin, &user, &1000);
```

See the tests in the [examples](#examples) above for the full test
implementation.

## Contract Interface

This interface can be found in the [SDK]. It extends the common
[token interface](token-interface.mdx).
