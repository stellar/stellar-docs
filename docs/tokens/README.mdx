This brief compares the three primary tokenization models available on the Stellar network: Stellar Classic Assets (with built-in Stellar Asset Contract), SEP-41 Contract Tokens, and Regulated SEP-57 (T-REX) Tokens—to help issuers select the most appropriate model for their use case.

## 1. Stellar Classic Assets (with Built-in [Stellar Asset Contract][sac])

### What this category encompasses

All assets issued on the Stellar ledger (by a `G…` address) are **Classic Stellar Assets**. These assets can be represented in two forms:

- **Native Classic Form**  
  Held in trustlines and transferred via native payment operations.

- **Built-in Smart Contract (Stellar Asset Contract)**  
  A [Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)][sac] is deployed to a contract address for the asset, implementing the **SEP-41 token interface** so the asset can be used in smart contracts.

### How they work

- For protocol-level behavior and trustline semantics, see _Asset Design Considerations_ in Stellar Docs.
- Implemented at the protocol level, the **Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)** provides a smart contract interface that enables Stellar assets to interoperate seamlessly with Soroban smart contracts.
- Transfers between accounts and contracts using SAC result in the same underlying trustline debit/credit.

### Strengths

- Has the benefits of native Stellar assets (fast, low cost), making these great for remittances and micropayments.
- Can be used in Soroban contracts via SAC with a SEP-41 interface.
- Maintains issuer controls and trustline semantics even when used from contracts.
- Wide ecosystem wallet and indexer support. Classic assets are compatible with Stellar ecosystem products (such as Stellar wallets) and other ecosystem products (such as exchanges).
- Benefit from [anchors](../learn/fundamentals/anchors.mdx), the bridges between the Stellar network and traditional financial systems. Explore the global [Stellar anchor directory](https://anchors.stellar.org/) for further details.
- Give the issuer granular control over asset management with features that allow the issuer to [name the asset](./control-asset-access.mdx#naming-an-asset), [determine access control](./control-asset-access.mdx#controlling-access-to-an-asset-with-flags), [limit asset supply](./control-asset-access.mdx#limiting-the-supply-of-an-asset), [publish asset information](./publishing-asset-info.mdx), and [ensure compliance](./anatomy-of-an-asset.mdx#compliance).
- Native operations on Classic Assets emit standardized events through the Stellar Asset Contract, allowing off-chain systems and indexers to observe asset activity in a uniform way
- Event semantics are defined at the protocol level (CAP-0067).

### Tradeoffs

- Accounts must have an active trustline to receive, hold, and transact.
- Trustlines cannot be added programmatically through contract invocations, limiting support for assets that rely on bridging or chain abstraction patterns
- Native operations on Classic Assets also emit standardized events through the Stellar Asset Contract, allowing off-chain systems and indexers to observe asset activity in a uniform way. Event semantics are defined at the protocol level according to [CAP-0067](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0067.md).

### When to use

- Simple payment rails with optional smart contract integration
- Trustline-governed asset flows that also need Soroban composability

## 2. SEP-41 Contract Tokens

### What these are

Fully customizable contract tokens native to Soroban that implement the **SEP-41 token standard**, with their own storage and logic. [Contract tokens][ti] issued by a deployed WASM contract (`C...` addresses).

### How they work

- Issued and managed entirely in contract code
- Commonly used when custom logic is required:
  - Mint/burn rules
  - Vesting
  - Hooks
  - Custom transfer logic
- Contract tokens can be held by both `G…` accounts and `C…` accounts
- Balances are always stored in contract data entries

### Strengths

- Fully programmable token logic beyond what Classic Assets + SAC can express
- SEP-41 standard ensures broad tooling compatibility in Soroban
- Some ecosystem wallet support

### When to use

- DeFi primitives requiring complex tokenomics
- Asset behaviors not representable by Classic Assets alone
- When extending SEP-41 with custom functionality

## 3. ERC-3643 / SEP-57 (T-REX) Tokens

### What these are

A **permissioned token standard** for regulated, compliance-aware assets that extends SEP-41 with identity and rules enforcement.

### Strengths

- On-chain compliance
- On-chain identity
- Role/agent based structure tailored for institutions

### Tradeoffs

- Higher complexity
- Higher execution costs due to on-chain compliance and identity checks
- **Current state**:
  - Balance display supported in some ecosystem wallets via SEP-41
  - Transfers and control functions not yet supported in wallets
  - Indexer support is not provided out of the box and must be self-implemented

### When to use

- Institutional RWAs with strict on-chain compliance requirements
- Interoperability with Ethereum’s ERC-3643 ecosystem

## Conclusion

- **Classic Stellar Assets** are best for simple payments and fiat-backed assets, with optional smart contract interoperability via the Stellar Asset Contract.
- **SEP-41 Contract Tokens** are ideal for DeFi and advanced tokenomics requiring full programmability.
- **SEP-57 / ERC-3643 Tokens** are designed for regulated Real World Assets, offering on-chain compliance and identity with institutional-grade controls.

## More Info

### Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)

The **Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)** is a protocol-level contract that enables smart contracts to interact with assets issued on Stellar.

For any Stellar asset, an instance of the SAC can be deployed (by anyone) to a deterministic, reserved address. Once deployed, smart contracts can interact with that asset using standard contract calls.

The SAC has read/write access to:

- Account balances (for XLM)
- Trustline balances (for issued assets)
- Smart-contract token balances

This allows Stellar assets to interoperate seamlessly with Soroban smart contracts.

- [How to deploy a Stellar Asset Contract](#)

### Benefits of the SAC

**Compatibility**  
The SAC preserves full compatibility with the existing Stellar asset model, including trustlines, authorization flags, and the Stellar DEX.

**Cost & Resource Efficiency**  
Because the SAC is compiled into the protocol (rather than implemented as a user-deployed contract running in a VM), its functions are more resource-efficient than equivalent contract-coded logic.

**Minimal Setup**  
You don’t need to write or deploy a custom token contract. A Stellar asset’s SAC already exists at the protocol level and only needs to be deployed to be used.

**Extensible Administration**  
The asset admin can be a smart contract. Issuers may delegate administrative capabilities—such as authorization, minting, or clawbacks—to another contract, enabling custom or decentralized admin logic without replacing the asset itself.

### Limitations of the SAC

Aside from delegating admin logic, the behavior of a Stellar asset and its SAC **cannot be modified**. Core asset semantics (balances, transfers, trustlines) are fixed at the protocol level.

If your use case requires token behavior not supported by Stellar assets, you should use a **contract token** instead.

### Contract Tokens

For advanced or non-standard use cases, you can create a **contract token** that implements the **token interface**. This interface defines the required functions and events for compatibility with applications that work with tokens.

Key points:

- The SAC itself implements the token interface
- Applications built against the token interface can interact with **both** Stellar assets (via SAC) and contract tokens
- Contract tokens allow full customization of token logic

:::note

Smart contracts cannot use Stellar assets unless that Stellar asset has a deployed SAC. Anyone can deploy the SAC for a Stellar asset to its reserved address.

:::

### When You Need a Contract Token (Examples)

The following scenarios are **not possible** using the SAC, but can be implemented with a contract token:

- **Transfer Fees**  
  Implement a token that automatically deducts a 1% fee on every transfer and routes it to a designated address.

- **Token Factory Pattern**  
  Build a factory contract that programmatically deploys new instances of a token contract, enabling standardized, on-demand token creation.
