The interface below uses the Rust [soroban-sdk](../tools/sdks/library.mdx#soroban-rust-sdk) to declare a trait that complies with the [SEP-41](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0041.md) token interface.

```rust
pub trait TokenInterface {
    /// Returns the allowance for `spender` to transfer from `from`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `from` - The address holding the balance of tokens to be drawn from.
    /// * `spender` - The address spending the tokens held by `from`.
    fn allowance(env: Env, from: Address, spender: Address) -> i128;

    /// Set the allowance by `amount` for `spender` to transfer/burn from
    /// `from`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `from` - The address holding the balance of tokens to be drawn from.
    /// * `spender` - The address being authorized to spend the tokens held by
    ///   `from`.
    /// * `amount` - The tokens to be made available to `spender`.
    /// * `expiration_ledger` - The ledger number where this allowance expires. Cannot
    ///    be less than the current ledger number unless the amount is being set to 0.
    ///    An expired entry (where expiration_ledger < the current ledger number)
    ///    should be treated as a 0 amount allowance.

:::caution CAUTION WHEN MODIFYING ALLOWANCES

The `approve` function overwrites the previous value with `amount`, so it is possible for the previous allowance to be spent in an earlier transaction before `amount` is written in a later transaction. The result of this is that `spender` can spend more than intended. This issue can be avoided by first setting the allowance to 0, verifying that the spender didn't spend any portion of the previous allowance, and then setting the allowance to the new desired amount.
