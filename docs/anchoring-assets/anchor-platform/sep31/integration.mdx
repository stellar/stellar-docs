Integrating with the Anchor Platform for facilitating cross-border payments involves implementing the following, at a mimimum:

- [`GET /customer`][get-customer] & [`PUT /customer`][put-customer] KYC API endpoints to request & collect customers' KYC data
- [`GET /rate`][get-rate] RFQ API endpoint to provide FX rates between the on & off-chain assets supported
- [`PATCH /transactions`][patch-transactions] requests to update the Anchor Platform's transactions' statuses

The following may also be required depending on your use case:

- [`GET /fee`][get-fee] if your business wants to provide senders the option to skip the quote creation step
- [`GET /unique_address`][get-unique-address] if your business uses a custody service for on-chain assets
- [`PUT /customer/callback`][put-customer-callback] if your business wants to provide webhooks for customer status change events
- [`DELETE /customer`][delete-customer] if your business wants or is required to allow senders to request deletion of customer data

[get-customer]: /ap_api/callbacks/get-customer
[put-customer]: /ap_api/callbacks/put-customer
[get-rate]: /ap_api/callbacks/gen-rates
[patch-transactions]: /ap_api/resources/patch-transactions
[get-fee]: /ap_api/callbacks/get-fee
[get-unique-address]: /ap_api/callbacks/gen-address
[put-customer-callback]: /ap_api/callbacks/put-customer-callback
[delete-customer]: /ap_api/callbacks/del-customer

## Set Up Your Business Server

In this guide, we'll make references to the business server, which is the service that implements the endpoints mentioned above. Lets add the business server to our docker compose file.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  platform:
    image: stellar/anchor-platform:release-2.0.0-rc.1
    command: --sep-server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    env_file:
      - ./dev.env
    volumes:
      - ./config:/home
  business:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    env_file:
      - ./dev.env
    volumes:
      - ./config:/home
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    env_file:
      - ./dev.env
```
