Integrating with the Anchor Platform for facilitating cross-border payments involves implementing the following, at a mimimum:

- [`GET /customer`][get-customer] & [`PUT /customer`][put-customer] KYC API endpoints to request & collect customers' KYC data
- [`GET /rate`][get-rate] RFQ API endpoint to provide FX rates between the on & off-chain assets supported
- [`PATCH /transactions`][patch-transactions] requests to update the Anchor Platform's transactions' statuses

The following may also be required depending on your use case:

- [`GET /fee`][get-fee] if your business wants to provide senders the option to skip the quote creation step
- [`GET /unique_address`][get-unique-address] if your business uses a custody service for on-chain assets
- [`DELETE /customer`][delete-customer] if your business wants or is required to allow senders to request deletion of customer data
