Integrating with the Anchor Platform for facilitating cross-border payments involves the following, at a mimimum:

- Implementing the `GET /customer` & `PUT /customer` KYC API endpoints to request & collect customers' KYC data
- Implementing `GET /rate` RFQ API endpoint to provide FX rates between the on & off-chain assets supported
- Implementing `PATCH /transactions` requests to update the Anchor Platform's transactions' statuses

The following may also be required depending on your use case:

- Implementing `GET /fee` if `assets.sep31.quotes_required` is `false`
- Implementing `PUT /customer/callback` if your business wants to provide webhooks for customer status change events
- Implementing `DELETE /customer` if your business wants or is required to allow senders to request deletion of customer data
