## Enable Stellar Authentication

Stellar-based wallet applications create authenticated sessions with Stellar anchors by proving they, or their users, have sufficient control over a Stellar account. Once authenticated, the wallet application uses a session token provided by the anchor in subsequent requests to the anchor's standardized services.

The Anchor Platform supports this form of authentication with minimal configuration from the business.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP10_ENABLED=true
SEP10_HOME_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"
```

</CodeExample>

`SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED` is the private key to the public key you've specified as the `SIGNING_KEY` in your `stellar.toml` file. It will be used to sign authentication challenges presented to wallet applications, providing that you are in possession of the `SIGNING_KEY`. Wallets will check for this signature before signing and sending back the authentication challenge.

`SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET` is the encryption key that will be used to sign and verify the authentication tokens you issue to wallet applications after they or their users have proven control of their Stellar account.

:::info

By default, the Anchor Platform allows anyone with a Stellar account to authenticate with your services. If you'd like to only allow users of a particular wallet application to authenticate, or want to disallow specific users from authenticating, use the following environment variables. This is an optional feature and should only be added if it is a business requirement.

:::

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED=true
SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_ALLOWLIST=lobstr.co,api.vibrantapp.com,decaf.so,api.beansapp.com

SEP10_REQUIRE_KNOWN_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT=true
SEP10_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT_LIST=GBIBMZNXMD3P7HXVQCYIWWT5NG43NEIIY7VYBQ5SADV6UULUKCAJTGPG
```

</CodeExample>

`SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED` informs the Anchor Platform whether or not it should allow users of non-custodial wallets to authenticate without the wallet also identifying itself, and `SEP10_CLIENT_ATTTRIBUTION_ALLOWLIST` is the list of non-custodial wallets that can create authenticated sessions with your services.

`SEP10_REQUIRE_KNOWN_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT` informs the Anchor Platform whether or not it should allow users of custodial wallets to authenticate without the custodial wallet's public key being included in the `SEP10_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT_LIST`.

## Modify a Stellar Info File

Next, let's modify `stellar.toml` file created [earlier][sep1-ap]. Wallets need to know that SEP-10 functionality is supported by your business.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>
