## Architecture Overview

Before getting started with an Anchor Platform, let's get a bit familiar with the overall architecture. You will get familiar with the different servers provided by the platform, and all components that's needed to be hosted.

### Components

#### Client

Client is a user-facing application (wallet), that makes requests to the system. Clients make request to the Platform component called SEP-server, using sets of standards called [SEPs][seps] (Stellar Ecosystem Proposals)

#### SEP-server

SEP-server is a client-facing server (thus it needs to be accessible from the outside network). SEP server processes user requests and communicates with database, storing necessary user input. Note, that SEP server will never store any sensitive information, such as KYC (PII), in the database.

#### Database

Platform uses SQL database (Postgres) to store Stellar events and entities. Its primarily use is to store SEP (SEP-24/SEP-31) transactions.

#### Platform Server

Platform server is an internal component. It should be hosted in the private network and should not be accessible from the Internet. This server allows business server to communicate with other parts of the Anchor Platform (such as SEP-server) via set of [APIs][platform-api].

#### Stellar Observer

:::tip

This component is optional, and may be replaced by your own implementation.

Stellar observer tracks Stellar chain and automatically detects user payments' Stellar transactions, updating corresponding SEP transactions statuses.

#### Business Server

Finally, Business server is a server that you (business) must implement, in order to fully support most of the SEPs, supported by the Platform. Business server reacts to some user events (such as requesting a quote for SEP-38), and pushes updates to the Platform for user notification (for example, completing a bank transfer)

## Future architecture

### New Components

#### Event Service

Event service is a new component that will push events to both user and business via webhooks. Currently, some functionality of the event service is supported via [callback APIs][callback-api]

#### Custody Service

Custody service is a new component that allows business to connect to a custodial service (such as Fireblocks), in order to make payments and receive payments on the Stellar network. When used in self-custodial mode, this service is a next generation of the existing Stellar Observer.
