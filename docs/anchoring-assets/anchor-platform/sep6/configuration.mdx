## Modify a Stellar Info File

Next, let's modify the `stellar.toml` file created [earlier][sep1-ap]. Wallets need to know that SEP-6 functionality is supported by your business, and they also need to know all the currencies you support.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

TRANSFER_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep6"
WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"

# Add support for USDC
[[CURRENCIES]]
code = "USDC"
issuer = "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
status = "test"
is_asset_anchored = false
desc = "USD Coin issued by Circle"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>

Note that you will need to create another file for your production deployment that uses the public network's passphrase, your production service URLs, your Mainnet distribution accounts and signing key, as well as the Mainnet issuing accounts of the assets your service utilizes.

## Enable Programmatic Deposits & Withdrawals

Now you're ready to enable programmatic deposits and withdrawals using the SEP-6 API. Specify the following in your `dev.assets.yaml` file, and change the values depending on your use case. This example asset file enables support for Circle's USDC and a fiat USD to deposit from and withdraw to. The methods specified in the `deposit` and `withdraw` sections are the methods that will be exposed by the [`GET /info`][sep-6] SEP-6 endpoint under the `type` field in the case of `deposit` and `types` field in the case of `withdraw`.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
assets:
  - schema: stellar
    code: USDC
    issuer: GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
    distribution_account: GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7
    significant_decimals: 2
    sep6_enabled: true
    deposit:
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - SEPA
        - SWIFT
        - cash
    withdraw:
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - bank_account
        - cash
  - schema: iso4217
    code: USD
    significant_decimals: 2
```

</CodeExample>

The information provided for the `assets` value closely maps to the information that will be exposed to the wallet application using the [`GET /info`][sep-6] SEP-6 endpoint. The Anchor Platform also uses this information to validate requests made to your service.

## Test With the Demo Wallet

Wallets should now be able to discover, authenticate, and initiate transactions with your service! Your project and source files should now look something like this.

<CodeExample>

```
├── dev.env
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── config
│   ├── dev.assets.yaml
│   ├── dev.stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

Your environment should now look like the following.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
ASSETS_TYPE=file
ASSETS_VALUE=/home/dev.assets.yaml

SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TOML_TYPE=file
SEP1_TOML_VALUE=/home/dev.stellar.toml

SEP10_ENABLED=true
SEP10_HOME_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"
```

</CodeExample>

To test this out, go to the [Stellar Demo Wallet][stellar-demo-wallet].

Initiate a deposit transaction by doing the following:

- Create a new keypair
- Click the "Add Asset" button and enter
  - the code of the Stellar asset on your `stellar.toml` file
  - your home domain, `localhost:8080`
- Select the dropdown and click "SEP-6 Deposit", then click "Start"

The demo wallet should be able to find your `stellar.toml` file, authenticate using the Stellar keypair you just created, and initiate a transaction.
