import { CodeExample } from "@site/src/components/CodeExample"

This guide will walk you through installing, configuring, and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building a on & off ramp service compatible with [SEP-24][sep-24], the ecosystem's Hosted Deposits and Withdrawals standardized protocol. 

By leveraging the Anchor Platform's support for SEP-24, businesses make their on & off ramp service available as an in-app experience through Stellar-based applications such as wallets and exchanges.

:::note

As we improve the documentation, parts of this guide that are relevant to other use cases may be moved into their own sections.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Anchor Platform is to pull the [docker image][anchor-platform-image]. SEP-24 support is not yet officially released, but is available using the `edge` tag.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker pull stellar/anchor-platform:edge
```

</CodeExample>

## Configuration

In this guide we'll use [docker compose][docker-compose] for simplicity, but you can run the Anchor Platform using other tools that support docker as well, such as [minikube] or a full-blown [kubernetes] cluster.

Lets create a minimal compose file to get started.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
platform-server:
  image: stellar/anchor-platform:edge
  command: --sep-server
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  env_file:
    - ./config/dev.env
  volumes:
    - ./config:/home
```

</CodeExample>

The `--sep-server` option tells the Anchor Platform to make the API endpoints defined by the SEPs you've enabled via configuration on port 8080. This option also makes the Platform API available, which is the backend API your service(s) will use to communicate with the Anchor Platform.

:::note

A future release of the Anchor Platform will add an additional command line option for the Platform API, and update the `--sep-server` option to only make the SEP APIs available.

:::

### Create a Configuration File

The Anchor Platform supports two approaches for configuration: using environment variables or a YAML configuration file. While its possible to only use one of the two approaches, most deployments will use both due to the structure or security requirements of configuration specific values.

See the full set of configuration options in the Anchor Platform's [default values file][ap-default-values].

We'll use environment variables for most of our configuration and use our `config.yaml` file when simple key-value pairs aren't a good way to represent our values.

The compose file specifies a file for our environment variables and mounts a volume for other configuration files such as our YAML config file, so lets create those.

<CodeExample>

```bash
touch dev.env && mkdir config
```

</CodeExample>

Add an environment variable that specifies the path to our YAML configuration file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
ANCHOR_CONFIG_FILE=/home/config.yaml
```

</CodeExample>

Specify the following in your `config.yaml` file, and change the values depending on your preferences.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
version: 1

assets:
  type: json
  value: |
    {
        "assets": [
          {
            "schema": "stellar",
            "code": "USDC",
            "issuer": "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5",
            "distribution_account": "GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7",
            "significant_decimals": 2,
            "deposit": {
              "enabled": true,
              "min_amount": 1,
              "max_amount": 1000000
            },
            "withdraw": {
              "enabled": true,
              "min_amount": 1,
              "max_amount": 1000000
            },
            "sep24_enabled": true
          }
        ]
    }
```

</CodeExample>

The information provided for the `assets` value closely maps to the information that will be expsosed to wallet application using the [`GET /info`][sep24-get-info] SEP-24 endpoint. The Anchor Platform also uses this information to validate requests made to your service.

:::note

A future release of the Anchor Platform will support providing this JSON in a `.json` file or specifying this information in YAML format.

:::

### Publish a Stellar Info File

Next, lets enable applications to learn more about your service by hosting a `stellar.toml` file at a standardized URL path. This file allows applications to find information about your business, the assets your services utilize, as well as the root URL paths for these services. We can specify this file using the Anchor Platform.

Lets create a file called `dev.stellar.toml` file using the contents below as a starting point. For the full set of attributes, see the [SEP-1 specification][sep-1].

<CodeExample>

```toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024 = "http://localhost:8080/sep24"
WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"

[[CURRENCIES]]
code = "USDC"
issuer = "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
status = "test"
is_asset_anchored = false
desc = "USD Coin issued by Circle"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

Note that you'll need to create another file for your production deployment that uses the public network's passphrase, your production service URLs, your mainnet distribution accounts and signing key, as well as the mainnet issuing accounts of the assets your service utilizes.

</CodeExample>

In your `dev.env` file, specify the following.

<CodeExample>

```bash
SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TYPE=file
SEP1_VALUE=/home/dev.stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

This will tell the Anchor Platform that it should host the file specified by `SEP1_VALUE` at `./well-known/stellar.toml`.

Alternatively, your `stellar.toml` file could be hosted using a proper static file server like [nginx]. As long as your info file includes the appropriate URLs pointing to the Anchor Platform, this will work just fine.

### Enable Stellar Authentication

Stellar-based wallet applications create authenticated sessions with Stellar anchors by proving they, or their users, have sufficient control over a Stellar account. Once authenticated, the wallet application uses a session token provided by the anchor in subsequent requests to the anchor's standardized services.

The Anchor Platform supports this form of authentication with minimal configuration from the business.

<CodeExample>

```bash
SEP10_ENABLED=true
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"
```

</CodeExample>

`SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED` is the private key to the public key you've specified as the `SIGNING_KEY` in your `stellar.toml` file. It will be used to sign authentication challenges presented to wallet applications, providing that you are in possession of the `SIGNING_KEY`. Wallets will check for this signature before signing and sending back the authentication challenge.

`SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET` is the enyption key that will be used to sign and verify the authentication tokens you issue to wallet applications after they or thier users have proven control of their Stellar account.
