This guide will walk you through installing, configuring, and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building an on & off-ramp service compatible with [SEP-24][sep-24], the ecosystem's standardized protocol for hosted deposits and withdrawals.

By leveraging the Anchor Platform's support for SEP-24, businesses make their on & off-ramp service available as an in-app experience through Stellar-based applications such as wallets and exchanges, extending their reach and connecting with users through the applications they already use.

:::note

As we improve the documentation, parts of this guide that are relevant to other use cases may be moved into their own sections.

:::

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Anchor Platform is to pull the [docker image][anchor-platform-image]. SEP-24 support is not yet officially released, but is available using the `edge` tag.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker pull stellar/anchor-platform:edge
```

</CodeExample>

## Configuration

In this guide we'll use [docker compose][docker-compose] for simplicity, but you can run the Anchor Platform using other tools that support docker as well, such as [minikube] or a full-blown [kubernetes] cluster.

Let's create a minimal compose file to get started.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
platform-server:
  image: stellar/anchor-platform:edge
  command: --sep-server
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  env_file:
    - ./config/dev.env
  volumes:
    - ./config:/home
```

</CodeExample>

The `--sep-server` option tells the Anchor Platform to make the API endpoints defined by the SEPs you've enabled via configuration available on port 8080. This option also makes the Platform API available, which is the backend API your service(s) will use to communicate with the Anchor Platform.

:::note

A future release of the Anchor Platform will add an additional command line option for the Platform API, and update the `--sep-server` option to only make the SEP APIs available.

:::

The Anchor Platform supports two approaches for configuration: using environment variables or a YAML configuration file. For example, enabling SEP-24 in the Anchor Platform using an environment variable would look like the following:

```bash
# dev.env
SEP24_ENABLED=true
```

Alternatively, enabling SEP-24 using a yaml configuration file would look like the following:

```bash
# dev.env
ANCHOR_CONFIG_FILE=/home/dev.config.yaml
```

```yaml
# dev.config.yaml
sep24:
  enabled: true
```

Businesses are able to use one approach exclusively or a combination of both approaches. Nested variables in the YAML file are expressed using underscores or dots (`_`, `.`) when using environment variables. We'll use environment variables for our configuration in this guide.

See the full set of configuration options in the Anchor Platform's [default values file][ap-default-values].

### Specify Your Service's Assets

Let's create a file for our environment variables, and a directory for containing files referenced in our environment.

<CodeExample>

```bash
touch dev.env
mkdir config
touch config/dev.assets.yaml
```

</CodeExample>

The first thing we'll need to do is specify which assets our Anchor Platform deployment supports.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
ASSETS_TYPE=file
ASSETS_VALUE=/home/dev.assets.yaml
```

</CodeExample>

Specify the following in your `dev.assets.yaml` file, and change the values depending on your preferences.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# dev.assets.yaml
assets:
  - schema: stellar
    code: USDC
    issuer: GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
    distribution_account: GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7
    significant_decimals: 2
    deposit:
      enabled: true
      min_amount: 1
      max_amount: 1000000
    withdraw:
      enabled: true
      min_amount: 1
      max_amount: 1000000
    sep24_enabled: true
```

</CodeExample>

Update the above values based on the assets you'll be issuing. Make sure to specify the testnet `issuer` in your development file, and create your own `distribution_account` using a tool like [Stellar Lab][stellar-lab].

The information provided for the `assets` value closely maps to the information that will be expsosed to the wallet application using the [`GET /info`][sep24-get-info] SEP-24 endpoint. The Anchor Platform also uses this information to validate requests made to your service.

### Publish a Stellar Info File

Next, let's enable applications to learn more about your service by hosting a `stellar.toml` file at a standardized URL path. This file allows applications to find information about your business, the assets your services utilize, as well as the root URL paths for these services. We can host this file using the Anchor Platform.

Let's create a file called `dev.stellar.toml` file using the contents below as a starting point. For the full set of attributes, see the [SEP-1 specification][sep-1].

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024 = "http://localhost:8080/sep24"
WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"

[[CURRENCIES]]
code = "USDC"
issuer = "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
status = "test"
is_asset_anchored = false
desc = "USD Coin issued by Circle"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>

Note that you'll need to create another file for your production deployment that uses the public network's passphrase, your production service URLs, your Mainnet distribution accounts and signing key, as well as the Mainnet issuing accounts of the assets your service utilizes.

In your `dev.env` file, specify the following.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TYPE=file
SEP1_VALUE=/home/dev.stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

This will tell the Anchor Platform that it should host the file specified by `SEP1_VALUE` at `./well-known/stellar.toml`.

Alternatively, your `stellar.toml` file could be hosted using a proper static file server like [nginx]. As long as your info file includes the appropriate URLs pointing to the Anchor Platform, this will work just fine.

### Enable Stellar Authentication

Stellar-based wallet applications create authenticated sessions with Stellar anchors by proving they, or their users, have sufficient control over a Stellar account. Once authenticated, the wallet application uses a session token provided by the anchor in subsequent requests to the anchor's standardized services.

The Anchor Platform supports this form of authentication with minimal configuration from the business.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP10_ENABLED=true
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"
```

</CodeExample>

`SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED` is the private key to the public key you've specified as the `SIGNING_KEY` in your `stellar.toml` file. It will be used to sign authentication challenges presented to wallet applications, providing that you are in possession of the `SIGNING_KEY`. Wallets will check for this signature before signing and sending back the authentication challenge.

`SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET` is the encryption key that will be used to sign and verify the authentication tokens you issue to wallet applications after they or their users have proven control of their Stellar account.

By default, the Anchor Platform allows anyone with a Stellar account to authenticate with your services. If you'd like to only allow users of a particular wallet application to authenticate, or want to disallow specific users from authenticating, use the following environment variables. This is an optional feature and should only be added if it is a business requirement.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED=true
SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_ALLOWLIST=lobstr.co,api.vibrantapp.com,decaf.so,api.beansapp.com

SEP10_REQUIRE_KNOWN_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT=true
SEP10_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT_LIST=GBIBMZNXMD3P7HXVQCYIWWT5NG43NEIIY7VYBQ5SADV6UULUKCAJTGPG
```

</CodeExample>

`SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED` informs the Anchor Platform whether or not it should allow users of non-custodial wallets to authenticate without the wallet also identifying itself, and `SEP10_CLIENT_ATTTRIBUTION_ALLOWLIST` is the list of non-custodial wallets that can create authenticated sessions with your services.

`SEP10_REQUIRE_KNOWN_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT` informs the Anchor Platform whether or not it should allow users of custodial wallets to authenticate without the custodial wallet's public key being included in the `SEP10_OMNIBUS_ACCOUNT_LIST`.

### Enable Hosted Deposits & Withdrawals

Now you're ready to enable hosted deposits and withdrawals via the SEP-24 API. Add the following variables to your environment file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP24_ENABLED=true
SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081
SECRET_SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"
SECRET_SEP24_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"
```

</CodeExample>

`SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_BASE_URL` is the URL that the Anchor Platform will provide to wallet applications when they initiate transactions. Wallet applications will open this URL in a web view inside their app, handing over control of the user experience from the wallet to your business. We'll dive further into this experience in subsequent sections.

`SECRET_SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_JWT_SECRET` and `SECRET_SEP24_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET` are encryption keys that the Anchor Platform will use to generate short-lived tokens it will add to the URLs provided to the wallet. Your business server must also have these keys in its environment so it can verify the token's signature.

### Test With the Demo Wallet

Wallets should now be able to discover, authenticate, and initiate transactions with your service! Your project and source files should now look something like this.

<CodeExample>

```
├── dev.env
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── config
│   ├── dev.assets.yaml
│   ├── dev.stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

Your environment should now look like the following.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
ASSETS_TYPE=file
ASSETS_VALUE=/home/dev.assets.yaml

SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TYPE=file
SEP1_VALUE=/home/dev.stellar.toml

SEP10_ENABLED=true
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"

SEP24_ENABLED=true
SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081
SECRET_SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"
SECRET_SEP24_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"
```

</CodeExample>

To test this out, go to the [Stellar Demo Wallet][stellar-demo-wallet].

![demo wallet connected to the anchor platform](/assets/anchor-platform-sep24-demo-wallet.png)

Initiate a transaction by doing the following:

- Create a new keypair
- Click the "Add Asset" button and enter
  - the code of the Stellar asset on your `stellar.toml` file
  - your home domain, `localhost:8080`
- Select the dropdown and click "SEP-24 Deposit", then click "Start"

The demo wallet should be able to find your `stellar.toml` file, authenticate using the Stellar keypair you just created, and initiate a transaction. However, when the demo wallet attempts to open the URL provided by the Anchor Platform, you'll get a not found page.

![demo wallet after initiating a transaction](/assets/anchor-platform-sep24-demo-wallet-widget.png)

### Add Data Persistence

The Anchor Platform supports [PostgreSQL][postgresql] and [Aurora PostgreSQL][aurora-postgresql] for use in production, but also supports [H2][h2] or [SQLite][sqlite] for use in development. For managing migrations, the Anchor Platform uses [Flyway][flyway].

Before we move forward, let's add a database to our development environment so the transactions we initiate persist after stopping the service.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  platform-server:
    image: stellar/anchor-platform:edge
    command: --sep-server
    env_file:
      - ./dev.env
    volumes:
      - ./config:/home
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    env_file:
      - ./dev.env
```

</CodeExample>

Now let's update our environment so the platform server can connect to the database server.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
DATA_TYPE=postgres
DATA_SERVER=db
DATA_DATABASE=platform
SECRET_DATA_USERNAME=postgres
SECRET_DATA_PASSWORD=password
DATA_FLYWAY_ENABLED=true

POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

</CodeExample>

We have to create the `platform` database before the platform server can connect to it, so let's run the database container and create our database.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker compose up db
```

</CodeExample>

Copy the name of the container from the command's output. If you're in a directory called `sep24-anchor`, then your container will be `sep24-anchor-db-1`. Now let's create the database inside the container.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker exec -it sep24-anchor-db-1 psql -U postgres
```

</CodeExample>

Now that you're in the PostgreSQL console, create the database.

<CodeExample>

```sql
CREATE DATABASE platform;
```

</CodeExample>

Exit the container, and try to run the platform server in addition to the database.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker compose up
```

</CodeExample>

You should see the logs reporting a successful connection to the postgres database.

## Integration

Integrating with the Anchor Platform involves three key areas.

- Building a web-based user experience that can be opened in a mobile web view
- Providing transaction status updates to the Anchor Platform
- Fetching transaction status updates from the Anchor Platform

### Building a Web-Based User Experience

The Anchor Platform does not offer a whitelabel UI that your business can utilize, and instead expects the business to build their own UI and backend system. We won't build an entire on & off-ramp user experience in this guide, but will cover the ways in which your existing product should be updated to be compatible with the Anchor Platform.

#### Authentication

If your business has an existing on & off-ramp product, you likely have an existing system for user authentication. However, because the Anchor Platform authenticates the user prior to providing the business' URL, requiring the user to go through another form of authentication is actually unnecessary. In this way, the Anchor Platform can be thought of as providing an alternative form of authentication.

The business is free to continue requiring users to authenticate using their existing system, but the ideal user experience would skip this step and create an authenticated session for the user if they have already authenticated using their Stellar account.

The Anchor Platform adds a JWT `token` query parameter to the business' URL given to the wallet application. This token is signed by the previously-configured `SECRET_SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_JWT_SECRET` value, and includes the information you need to identify the user. The process should look something like this:

1. Pass the `token` added to the URL of your backend system
2. Verify the signature on the `token` and check its expiration
3. Fetch the transaction data using the token's `jti` from the Anchor Platform
4. Create an authenticated session for the user identified in the transaction

The decoded contents of the `token` will look something like this:

<CodeExample>

```json
{
  "jti": "e26cf292-814f-4918-9b40-b4f76a300f98",
  "sub": "GB244654NC6YPEFU3AY7L25COGES445P3Q63W6Q76JHR3UBJMLT2XBOB:1234567",
  "exp": 1516239022,
  "data": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
  }
}
```

</CodeExample>

Note that the `sub` value identifies the user using a Stellar account and integer. This is what the value will be when custodial applications that use an omnibus account authenticate with your service. When non-custodial wallets authenticate, the token may look slightly different.

<CodeExample>

```json
{
  "jti": "e26cf292-814f-4918-9b40-b4f76a300f98",
  "sub": "GB244654NC6YPEFU3AY7L25COGES445P3Q63W6Q76JHR3UBJMLT2XBOB",
  "exp": 1516239022,
  "data": {
    "client_domain": "api.vibrantapp.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
  }
}
```

</CodeExample>

The `sub` value here only contains a public key to identify the user, and the `data.client_domain` field identifies the wallet application used to authenticate.

In both cases, all information in the `data` object is optional, and will only be present if the wallet provides that information.

Let's add a backend server to our compose file that will be used to verify the token and create authenticated web sessions for users initiating transactions.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
---
business-server:
  build: .
  ports:
    - "8081:8081"
  env_file:
    - ./dev.env
  depends_on:
    - platform-server
```

</CodeExample>

Let's create a simple Docker container for our application.

<CodeExample>

```docker
FROM node:19

WORKDIR /home
COPY . .
RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

</CodeExample>

Now let's create a minimal NodeJS application.

<CodeExample>

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add express jsonwebtoken
touch server.js
```

</CodeExample>

Below is an example of a backend server authenticating a user using NodeJS.

<CodeExample>

```js
# server.js
const express = require("express");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.BUSINESS_SERVER_PORT;

app.use(express.json());

/*
 * We'll store user session data in memory, but production systems
 * should store this data somewhere more persistent.
 */
const sessions = new Set();

/*
 * Create an authenticated session for the user.
 *
 * Return a session token to be used in future requests as well as the
 * transaction and user data. Note that you may not have a user for the
 * stellar account provided, in which case the user should go through
 * your onboarding process.
 */
app.post("/session", async (req, res) => {
  let decodedPlatformToken;
  try {
    decodedPlatformToken = validatePlatformToken(req.body.platformToken);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status = 400;
    res.send({ "error": err });
    return;
  }
  let platformTransaction;
  try {
    platformTransaction = await getPlatformTransaction(decodedPlatformToken.jti);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status = 500;
    res.send({ "error": err })
    return;
  }
  let sessionToken = jwt.sign(
    { "jti": platformTransaction.id },
    process.env.SESSION_JWT_SECRET
  );
  sessions.add(sessionToken)
  res.send({
    "token": sessionToken,
    "transaction": platformTransaction,
    "user": getUser(decodedPlatformToken.sub)
  });
});

/*
 * Validate the signature and contents of the platform's token
 */
function validatePlatformToken(token) {
  if (!token) {
    throw "missing 'platformToken'";
  }
  let decodedToken;
  try {
    decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, process.env.SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET);
  } catch {
    throw "invalid 'platformToken'";
  }
  if (!decodedToken.jti) {
    throw "invalid 'platformToken': missing 'jti'";
  }
  return decodedToken;
}

/*
 * Fetch the transaction data from the Platform API
 *
 * Production systems should have proper retry mechanisms.
 */
async function getPlatformTransaction(transactionId) {
  let response = await fetch(`${process.env.PLATFORM_SERVER}/transactions/${transactionId}`)
  if (response.status != 200) {
    throw `unexpected status code: ${response.status}`;
  }
  return await response.json();
}

/*
 * Query your own database for the user based on account:memo string parameter
 */
function getUser(sub) {
  return null;
}

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`business server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

</CodeExample>

Run this with the platform server and database and initiate a new transaction with the [demo wallet][stellar-demo-wallet]. Then, we'll send the token to our server.

<CodeExample>

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"platformToken": "<paste the token from the URL here>"}' \
  http://localhost:8081/session | jq
```

</CodeExample>

### Providing Updates to the Platform

When the user has provided you the information necessary to facilitate the transaction, you need to update the transaction's status and provide some of the information you collected to the Anchor Platform.

In general, you'll want to provide updates for the following events:

- Your business is ready to receive funds from the user
- Your business has received funds from the user
- Your business has sent funds to the user
- Your business has processed a refund for the user's transaction
- Your business experienced an unexpected error

This is done using the Platform API's `PATCH /transactions` request. This endpoint allows you to update the data returned from the Platform API's `GET /transaction/:id` endpoint as well as the data provided to wallet applications through the applicable SEP endpoints.

:::note

In the next major version release of the Anchor Platform, we'll be replacing the `PATCH /transactions` Platform API endpoint with a JSON RPC endpoint that will simplify the request schema, provide better validation of data, and make the API easier to understand in general.

:::

Let's create an endpoint for our business server that accepts the information collected in our UI.

<CodeExample>

```js
# server.js

// Production systems should either let the Anchor Platform generate its own memos
// or have your custodial service generate a memo for each transaction.
const transactionMemos = {};

app.post("/transaction", async (req, res) => {
  let sessionToken;
  try {
    sessionToken = validateSessionToken(req.headers.get("authorization"));
  } catch (err) {
    res.status = 400;
    res.send({ "error": err })
    return;
  }
  // assuming this is a withdrawal transaction, we'll provide a memo, which is
  // required by our third-party custodian to credit us the payment. When the
  // payment is made with this memo, we can match the on-chain payment with the
  // transaction in the Anchor Platform's database.
  transactionMemos[req.body.transaction.id] = parseInt(Math.random() * 100000);
  let patchTransactionBody = {
    "id": req.body.transaction.id,
    "status": "pending_user_transfer_start",
    "memo": transactionMemos[req.body.transaction.id],
    "amount_in": {
      "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5",
      "amount": req.body.amount_in.amount,
    },
    "amount_fee": {
      "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5",
      "amount": req.body.amount_fee.amount,
    },
    "amount_out": {
      "asset": "iso4217:USD",
      "amount": req.body.amount_out.amount,
    },
    "message": "waiting for the user to provide off-chain funds."
  };
  let platformResponse;
  try {
    platformResponse = await updatePlatformTransaction(patchTransactionBody);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status = 500;
    res.send({ "error": err })
    return;
  }
  res.send({
    "transaction": platformResponse.records[0]
  });
});

function validateSessionToken(authorizationHeader) {
    let parts = authorizationHeader.split(" ");
    if (parts.length != 2 || parts[0] != "Bearer") {
        throw "invalid authorization header format";
    }
    let sessionToken = parts[1];
    try {
        jwt.verify(sessionToken, process.env.SESSION_JWT_SECRET);
    } catch {
        throw "invalid session token";
    }
    if (!sessions.has(sessionToken)) {
        throw "expired session";
    }
    return sessionToken;
}

async function updatePlatformTransaction(requestBody) {
  let response = await fetch(
    `${process.env.PLATFORM_SERVER}/transactions`,
    {
      method: "PATCH",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
    }
  );
  if (response.status != 200) {
    throw `unexpected status code: ${response.status}`;
  }
  return await response.json();
}
```

</CodeExample>

This will update the Anchor Platform's database with the information provided and enable wallet applications to fetch this updated information so it can relay it back to the user. You should have already informted the user of the transaction's amounts and that your business is waiting for on-chain payment to arrive, but providing these updates allows users to view their transactions' statuses through their mobile application without opening the business' UI again.

:::note

At this time, the Anchor Platform does not send notifications to the wallet application when transaction statuses change, however, it is on our roadmap to add these notifications or "callback requests" so that wallet applications do not have to poll the Anchor Platform for updates.

:::

### Fetching Updates from the Platform

If you only use the Anchor Platform to expose the SEP APIs to wallet applications, then you won't have a strong reason for fetching transaction status updates from the Anchor Platform, mostly because it won't update the transaction status until you make requests to `PATCH /transactions`.

However, if you use the Anchor Platform to monitor the Stellar network for incoming payments (associated with withdrawal transactions), the Anchor Platform will update transaction statuses when payments are received.

There are two ways to fetch updates from the Anchor Platform,

- Polling the Platform API's `GET /transactions/:id` endpoint for the transactions you're expecting a payment for
- Streaming transaction status change events from a Kafka cluster

While streaming transaction status changes from a Kafka cluster may be a more robust and scalable approach, we're going to use the polling method in this guide. Setting up and using a Kafka cluster will be the subject of a different section of the docs.

:::note

In the future, the Anchor Platform will also support making payments associated with deposit transactions to users on behalf of the business. This is another reason why you may want to use the Anchor Platform's event system.

:::

First, let's configure the Anchor Platform to observe the Stellar network for incoming payments.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
---
stellar-observer:
  image: stellar/anchor-platform:edge
  command: --stellar-observer
  env_file:
    - ./dev.env
  volumes:
    - ./config:/home
  depends_on:
    - db
```

</CodeExample>

The `--stellar-observer` command starts a process that monitors the distribution accounts configured in your `config.yaml` file for withdrawal payments.

If a payment is sent to one of these accounts and the memo attached to the transaction matches a `memo` value provided or generated by the Anchor Platform, the Anchor Platform will consider the transaction that memo is associated with as received and update the transaction's status to `pending_anchor`.

Let's make some additions to the `server.js` file so we can poll the Anchor Platform for our expected payments.

<CodeExample>

```js
# server.js
...
(async () => {
  while (true) {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));
    let requestPromises;
    for (const transactionId in transactionMemos) {
      requestPromises.push(getPlatformTransaction(transactionId))
    }
    let transactions = await new Promise.all(requestPromises);
    for (const transaction in transactions) {
      // assuming all requests were successful
      if (transaction.status == "pending_anchor") {
        // initiate off-chain delivery of funds
        console.log(`received payment for transaction ${transaction.id}`);
      }
    }
  }
})()
```

</CodeExample>
