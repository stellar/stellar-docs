This guide will walk you through installing, configuring, and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building a on & off ramp service compatible with [SEP-24][sep-24]. 

:::note

As we improve the documentation, parts of this guide that are relevant to other use cases may be moved into their own sections.

:::

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Anchor Platform is to use [Docker][docker] and pull the [image][anchor-platform-image]. SEP-24 support is currently unreleased but is available using the `edge` tag.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker pull stellar/anchor-platform:edge
```

</CodeExample>

### Configuration

In this guide we'll use [docker compose][docker-compose] for simplicity, but you can run the Anchor Platform using other tools that support docker as well, such as [minikube] or a full-blown [kubernetes] cluster.

Lets create a minimal compose file to get started.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
platform-server:
  image: stellar/anchor-platform:edge
  command: --sep-server
  env_file:
    - ./config/dev.env
  volumes:
    - ./config:/home
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
```

</CodeExample>

The `--sep-server` option tells the Anchor Platform to make the API endpoints defined by the SEPs currently configured available on port 8080. This option also makes the Platform API available, which is the backend API your service(s) will use to communicate with the Anchor Platform.

:::note

A future release of the Anchor Platform will add an additional option for the Platform API, and update the `--sep-server` option to only make the SEP APIs available.

:::

The compose file also specifies a file for our environment variables and mounts a volume for other configuration files, so lets create those.

<CodeExample>

```bash
touch dev.env && mkdir config
```

</CodeExample>

The Anchor Platform supports two approaches for configuration, using environment variables or a YAML configuration file. While its technically possible to only use one of the two approaches, most deployments will use both for different values due to their their format or sensitivity.

Lets start by adding a environment variable that specifies the path to our YAML configuration file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
ANCHOR_CONFIG_FILE=/home/config.yaml
```

</CodeExample>

We'll use environment variables for most of our configuration and use our `config.yaml` file when simple key-value pairs aren't a good way to represent our values. For example, the Anchor Platform requires a JSON string containing information on the Stellar asssets our service will utilize.

Specify the following in your `config.yaml` file, and change the values depending on your preferences.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
version: 1

assets:
  type: json
  value: |
    {
        "assets": [
          {
            "schema": "stellar",
            "code": "USDC",
            "issuer": "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5",
            "distribution_account": "GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7",
            "significant_decimals": 2,
            "deposit": {
              "enabled": true,
              "min_amount": 1,
              "max_amount": 1000000
            },
            "withdraw": {
              "enabled": true,
              "min_amount": 1,
              "max_amount": 1000000
            },
            "sep24_enabled": true
          }
        ]
    }
```
