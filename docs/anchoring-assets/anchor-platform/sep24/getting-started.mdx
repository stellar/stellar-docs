This guide will walk you through installing, configuring, and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building a on & off ramp service compatible with [SEP-24][sep-24]. 

<Alert>

As we improve the documentation, parts of this guide that are relevant to other use cases may be moved into their own sections.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Anchor Platform is to use [Docker][docker] and pull the [image][anchor-platform-image]. SEP-24 support is currently unreleased but is available using the `edge` tag.

<CodeExample>

```bash
$ docker pull stellar/anchor-platform:edge
```
