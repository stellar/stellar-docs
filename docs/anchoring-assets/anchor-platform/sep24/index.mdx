This guide will walk you through configuring and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building an on & off-ramp service compatible with [SEP-24][sep-24], the ecosystem's standardized protocol for hosted deposits and withdrawals.

By leveraging the Anchor Platform's support for SEP-24, businesses make their on & off-ramp service available as an in-app experience through Stellar-based applications such as wallets and exchanges, extending their reach and connecting with users through the applications they already use.

Before continuing with this section, make sure that you have already [installed][installation-ap] the Anchor Platform, and configured necessary features, required by SEP-24: [SEP-1 (Stellar Info File)][sep1-ap] and [SEP-10 (Stellar Authentication)][sep10-ap]
