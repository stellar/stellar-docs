### How To Handle User Request?

As part of the flow, once a user makes an interactive withdrawal/deposit request, it will be processed by the Anchor Platform and forwarded to your service. The Anchor Platform will make a `GET` call to `<configured interactive url>?token=<jwt token>`.

This JWT token will contain:

1. `exp` is the expiration time of the token. You should check that the provided token has not expired.
2. `sub` is the account associated with this transaction. It can be used to identify the user account. Note that this value may be different from the account that will be used to receive/send funds.
3. `jti` is the hash of the transaction.
4. `data` is the extra payload that has been set by the user. If provided, it will contain `amount` (amount that was requested by the user to be pre-filled), `client_domain` (client domain of the wallet), `lang` (language), and [SEP-9] fields.

### How To Provide Fees?

Currently, it's recommended to provide fees/exchange rates in the iFrame/web view of your application.

[SEP-24] standard provides a `/fee` endpoint to allow businesses to set static fees for their transactions. However, it's not currently supported by the Anchor Platform.

:::note

/fee endpoint will be deprecated in the future.
