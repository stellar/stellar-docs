### How To Use Interactive JWTs?

As part of the flow, once a user makes an interactive withdrawal/deposit request, it will be processed by the Anchor Platform and forwarded to your service. The Anchor Platform will make a `GET` call to `<configured interactive url>?token=<jwt token>`.

This JWT token will contain:

1. `exp` is the expiration time of the token. You should check that the provided token has not expired.
2. `sub` is the account associated with this transaction. It can be used to identify the user account. Note that this value may be different from the account that will be used to receive/send funds.
3. `jti` is the hash of the transaction.
4. `data` is the extra payload that has been set by the user. It will always contain the `asset` requested by the user (Stellar asset user want to receive in deposit case, and withdraw in withdrawal case). On top of that, `data` also has some additional input. If provided, it will contain `amount` (amount that was requested by the user to be pre-filled), `client_domain` (client domain of the wallet, that wallet used during SEP-10 authentication), `lang` (language).

### How To Provide Fees?

Currently, it's recommended to provide fees/exchange rates in the iFrame/web view of your application.

[SEP-24] standard provides a `/fee` endpoint to allow businesses to set static fees for their transactions. However, it's not currently supported by the Anchor Platform.

:::note

/fee endpoint will be deprecated in the future.

### How to identify user account?

You should use `sub` field of the JWT token. For custodial wallet, this value will be in the format `account:memo`. Use memo to identity the user. For noncustodial wallet, simply use `sub` value itself, which will be equal to the user account.

### How to identify wallet?

You should use combination of `sub` and `data.client_domain` fields of the JWT token. For custodial wallet, `sub` value will be in the format `account:memo`. Use `account` id to identity the wallet. For noncustodial wallet, use the `data.client_domain` field. Note, that wallet must provide the `client_domain` beforehand as a part of SEP-10 authentication.
