Wallets connect to anchors using standard way of authentication via Stellar network defined by the [sep-10] standard.

There are many ways of using this authentication method and in this guideline we will cover all options to authenticating with the Anchor.

## Creating authentication key

:::info Custodial wallets only :::

First, let's create an authentication key. While you can use the same key for authentication and sending funds, it's recommended to split the responsibilities. In your application, you will have one or more funds keypairs (keypairs for the accounts that hold funds, initiate and receive transactions) and one authentication key.

Authentication key is only used for the authentication purposes and don't need to hold any funds. Note, that you don't need to create account for this key pair either.

Go to [Stellar Lab] and generate a keypair. The secret key must be handled securely, because it will be used to authenticate with.

## Basic authentication

Let's do a basic authentication. In this example we will use wallet sdk to create an authentication token.

First, let's create an `anchor` object to work with the anchor you are integrating with. In this example, we will be using reference anchor `testanchor.stellar.org`

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val anchor = wallet.anchor("https://testanchor.stellar.org")
```

</CodeExample>

Next, authenticate with the `authKey` created earlier:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val authKey = SigningKeyPair.fromSecret("my secret key")

suspend fun getAuthToken(): AuthToken {
    return anchor.auth().authenticate(authKey)
}
```

</CodeExample>
