## What is a wallet?

Wallet in application that allows its user to hold assets, such as native Stellar native asset (XLM), stablecoins (USDC) or any other asset issued on chain. Wallets can also help users exchange their assets, sometimes using entities called anchors.

## Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Applications

Some applications, such as centralized exchanges, are custodial, meaning the application has access to the private keys of the acccounts holding its users’ funds on Stellar. Typically, custodial applications pool user funds into a smaller set of managed Stellar accounts, called pooled, shared, or omnibus accounts.

Other applications are non-custodial, meaning the application does not have access to the private keys of the accounts holding its users' funds on Stellar. Typically, non-custodial applications create or import a pre-existing Stellar account for each user.

These two approaches require minor but concrete differences in how applications integrate with MoneyGram Access. The sub-sections below will describe these differences, but the rest of this tutorial will assume the application is custodial.

## What is an anchor?

An anchor is a Stellar-specific term for the on and off-ramps that connect the Stellar network to traditional financial rails, such as financial institutions or fintech companies. Anchors accept deposits of fiat currencies (such as the US dollar, Argentine peso, or Nigerian naira) via existing rails (such as bank deposits or cash-in points), then sends the user the equivalent digital tokens on the Stellar network. The equivalent digital tokens can either represent that same fiat currency or another digital token altogether. Alternatively, anchors allow token holders to redeem their tokens for the real-world assets they represent.

Stellar has anchor services operating worldwide. View the [Anchor Directory](https://resources.stellar.org/anchors?) for more information on existing Stellar anchors.

This documentation will instruct you on how to connect to the anchor as the wallet.

## Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) and interoperability

Stellar is an open-source network that is designed to interoperate with traditional financial institutions, various types of assets, and other networks. Network participants implement Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) to ensure they can interoperate with other products and services on the network. SEPs are publicly created, open-source documents that live in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem#stellar-ecosystem-proposals-seps) and they define how asset issuers, applications, exchanges, and other service providers should interact and interoperate.

Read more about SEPs in the [SEPs section](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-ecosystem-proposals).

As a wallet, the most important SEPs are [SEP-24]: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal, and [SEP-31]: Cross Border Payments API. You’ll also work with [SEP-10]: Stellar Authentication, [SEP-12]: KYC API, and [SEP-38]: Anchor RFQ API.
