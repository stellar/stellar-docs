[Sep-24] standard defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users. Wallets use this standard to facilitate exchanges between on-chain assets (such as stablecoins) and off-chain assets (such as fiat, or other networks assets, e.g. BTC).

During the flow wallet makes several requests to the anchor, and finally receives an interactive URL to open in iframe. This URL is used by the user to provide an input (such as KYC) directly to the Anchor. Finally, wallet can fetch transaction information using query endpoints.
