For local development, we recommend [downloading](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/quickstart) and running a local instance via [Docker Quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) and running a local network or communicating with a live development [Testnet].

:::caution

We don't recommend running the Quickstart image in production. See the [deploy your own RPC instance](./installing.mdx) section.

:::

The Quickstart image with the RPC service can run on a standard laptop with 8GB of RAM and has minimal storage and CPU requirements. It is a single container that runs everything you need to test against a fully featured network. It contains:

- [Stellar Core] - Node software that runs the network, coordinates consensus, and finalizes ledgers.
- [Stellar RPC] server - JSON RPC server for interacting with Soroban contracts.
- [Horizon server] - HTTP API for accessing ledger state and historical transactions.
- [Friendbot server] - HTTP API for creating and funding new accounts on test networks.

[Stellar Core]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core
[Stellar RPC]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/tree/main
[Horizon server]: https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon
[Friendbot server]: https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/friendbot

### Standalone

To run a local standalone network with the Stellar Quickstart Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --name stellar \
    stellar/quickstart:testing \
    --local \
    --enable-stellar-rpc
```

Once the image is started, you can check RPC's status by querying the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/rpc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
      "jsonrpc":"2.0",
      "id":2,
      "method":"getHealth"
      }'
```

You can interact with this local node using the Stellar CLI. First, add it as a configured network:

```bash
stellar network add local \
    --rpc-url "http://localhost:8000/rpc" \
    --network-passphrase "Standalone Network ; February 2017"
```

Then generate a unique identity (public/private keypair) and to fund it using:

```bash
stellar keys generate alice
```

:::tip Test-only Identities

It's a good practice to never use the same keys for testing and development that you use for the public Stellar network. Generate new keys for testing and development and avoid using them for other purposes.

:::

Now that you have a configured network and a funded identity, you can use these within other Stellar CLI commands. For example, deploying a contract:

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project_name].wasm \
    --source alice \
    --network local
```

Or invoking a contract:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
    --id C... \
    --source alice \
    --network local \
    -- \
    hello \
    --to friend
```

When you're done with your local node, you can close it with <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> (not <kbd>cmd</kbd>). This will fully remove the container (that's what the `--rm` option to the `docker` command does), which means you will need to re-deploy your contract and re-fund your identity the next time you start it. If you work with local nodes often, you may want to create scripts to make these initialization steps easier. For example, see the [example dapp's `initialize.sh`](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp/blob/abdac3afdb6c410cc426831ece93371c1a27347d/initialize.sh).

### Testnet

Running your own Testnet node works much the same way as running a Quickstart node, as described above. You will need minor modifications for a few commands. First, you need `--testnet` for the docker instance, rather than `--standalone`:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --name stellar \
    stellar/quickstart:testing \
    --testnet \
    --enable-stellar-rpc
```

And you'll want to configure it for use with the `--network` flag in Stellar CLI:

```bash
stellar network add testnet \
    --rpc-url "http://localhost:8000/rpc" \
    --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

Replace `testnet` in that command with the name of your choice if you want to leave the name `testnet` available for use with a public RPC provider (see below). Or make clever use of `--global` configs for public providers and local configs (made with the undecorated `network add` command above) for local nodes.

Now you can replace `--network standalone` with `--network testnet` (or whatever you named it) in all your commands that need a network, like the `deploy` and `invoke` commands shown above.

### Futurenet

You can also develop your Soroban contracts against the Futurenet network. You may choose this if you want to test more bleeding-edge features that haven't made it to the Testnet yet. Running your own Futurenet node works just like running a Testnet node, as described above.

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --name stellar \
    stellar/quickstart:future \
    --futurenet \
    --enable-stellar-rpc
```

And you'll want to configure it for use with the `--network` flag in Stellar CLI:

```bash
stellar network add futurenet \
    --rpc-url "http://localhost:8000/rpc" \
    --network-passphrase "Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022"
```

Replace `futurenet` in that command with the name of your choice, if you want to leave the name `futurenet` available for use with a public RPC provider (see below). Or make clever use of `--global` configs for public providers and local configs (made with the undecorated `network add` command above) for local nodes.

Now you can replace `--network standalone` with `--network futurenet` (or whatever you named it) in all your commands that need a network, like the `deploy` and `invoke` commands shown above.
