The RPC service can be installed on bare metal or a virtual machine. It is natively supported on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

### Hardware Requirements

| Node Type | CPU | RAM | Disk | AWS SKU | Google Cloud SKU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stellar RPC | 2 vCPU | 4GB | 125 GB persistent volume >= 3K IOPS | [c5.large] | [n4-highcpu-2] |

_\* Disk: Assuming the default 7-day retention window for data storage. Otherwise, 20GB + 15GB per retention day_ _\* RAM/CPU: Assuming RPC will serve up to 1000 requests per second. For deployments expecting 1000-10000+ requests per second to Stellar RPC, we recommend at least 8GB of RAM and at least a quad core CPU with a 2.4GHz clock speed._

We highly recommend using a local SSD disk for storage. RPC is compatible with network-based filesystems like AWS EBS but it will negatively impact its performance.
