For production, we recommend running Stellar RPC with a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) configuration file rather than CLI flags. This is similar to creating a configuration file for Stellar-Core as we did previously. For example, using [our docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-rpc):

```bash
docker run -p 8001:8001 -p 8000:8000 \
-v <CONFIG_FOLDER>:/config stellar/stellar-rpc \
--config-path <RPC_CONFIG_FILENAME>
```

Use this [Stellar RPC subcommand](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/blob/main/cmd/stellar-rpc/README.md#configuring-and-running-rpc-server) to generate a starter configuration file:

```bash
docker run stellar/stellar-rpc:latest gen-config-file > stellar-rpc-config.toml
```

The resulting configuration should look like this:

```toml

# from the Internet and does not use TLS. "" (default) disables the admin server
# ADMIN_ENDPOINT = ""

```

Note that the above generated configuration contains the default values and you need to substitute them with proper values to run the image. For instance, when using a container, it is recommended to create a volume for the Captive Core and RPC persistent storage and point `CAPTIVE_CORE_STORAGE_PATH` and `DB_PATH` to it accordingly.

Then, you should create a configuration file for [Stellar Core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core). You can find sample configuration files for [Testnet](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledgerbackend/configs/captive-core-testnet.cfg) and [Pubnet](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledgerbackend/configs/captive-core-pubnet.cfg)

When using docker, you should create and mount a volume [mount a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) on your container where the above configuration is stored.

If you are running locally on a unix-style machine, you could create a folder in your home directory called `~/rpc-config`

```
cd ~
mkdir rpc-config
```

Then you would add the following config files to that local directory:

- soroban-rpc-config.toml
- stellar-captive-core.cfg

Then you would mount that volume using by adding the following parameter: `-v /Users/<USERNAME>/test-rpc-config:/opt/stellar` to your `docker run` command.

Your running container would mount that volume at the path `/opt/stellar`

## Next Step

After installation is complete, you are now ready to proceed to [Running RPC](./running.mdx)!
