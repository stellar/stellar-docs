We offer three alternatives to deploy your own RPC instance:

1. Run the [stellar-rpc docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-rpc)
2. Install a Debian package.
3. Install from source.

### Docker Image

This is the preferred way to deploy your own RPC instance.

:::caution

Although we have a [Quickstart Image](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart), it's for local development and testing only. It is not suitable for production-grade deployments.

:::

Pull the image at the version you'd like to run from [the tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-rpc/tags):

```bash
docker pull stellar/stellar-rpc
```

### Debian package

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates curl jq wget gnupg apt-utils gpg && \
    curl -sSL https://apt.stellar.org/SDF.asc | gpg --dearmor >/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/SDF.gpg && \
    echo "deb https://apt.stellar.org focal stable" >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/SDF.list && \
    echo "deb https://apt.stellar.org focal testing" >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/SDF-testing.list && \
    echo "deb https://apt.stellar.org focal unstable" >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/SDF-unstable.list && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y stellar-core stellar-rpc && \
    apt-get clean
```

### Build From Source

Instructions for building Stellar RPC from source can be found [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/blob/main/cmd/stellar-rpc/README.md).

## Next Step

After installation is complete, you are now ready to proceed to [Configuring RPC](./configuring.mdx)!
