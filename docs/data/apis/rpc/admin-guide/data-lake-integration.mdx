Expand your RPC node's capabilities by connecting it to a data lake for complete historical ledger access.

#### Integration Overview

RPC version 23.0 introduces data lake integration for the `getLedgers` endpoint, enabling access to the historical ledgers outside your node's local retention period (typically 7 days). All other RPC endpoints will still operate based on the `HISTORY_RETENTION_WINDOW` configured on your node.

The process involves setting up a ledger data lake and then configuring your RPC node to use it.

:::info

The metadata of a ledger returned by `getLedgers` may vary depending on its source. When a ledger is retrieved from the RPC's local datastore, its metadata is subject to your RPC configuration. However, ledgers fetched from the data lake are typically stored with all metadata included.

### 1. Accessing a Data Lake

You have two options for utilizing a data lake:

- **Public Data Lake:** The simplest way is to use a publicly available data lake. For example, Stellar ledger data lake is available through the AWS Open Data program at `s3://aws-public-blockchain/v1.1/stellar/ledgers/pubnet`.
- **Self-Hosted Data Lake:** This method lets you have more control over data integrity, availability and access, but requires you to create and manage your own data lake. The **Galexie** tool can help you deploy a data lake on either AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS). For detailed instructions, refer to the [Galexie Admin Guide](../../../../data/indexers/build-your-own/galexie/README.mdx).

### 2. Configuring RPC for Data Lake Integration

#### Pre-requisite

Before you begin, configure your RPC node with cloud provider credentials and ensure it has read permissions for the data lake bucket.

#### Configuration Steps

Update your RPC node's configuration file with the following settings:

1.  **Specify Storage Path:** Define the storage backend (`GCS` or `S3`) and provide the full path to the bucket (e.g., `my-bucket/path/to/data`).
2.  **Enable the Feature Flag:** Set `SERVE_LEDGERS_FROM_DATASTORE` to `true`.
3.  **Configure Ledger Backend:** Configure how data is read from the datastore through [BufferedStorageBackend](../../../../data/indexers/build-your-own/ingest-sdk/developer_guide/ledgerbackends/bufferedstoragebackend.mdx).

#### Configuration Examples

Below are examples for configuring GCS and S3 backends.

A. GCS Configuration Example

```toml
# Enable fetching historical ledgers from the datastore when not available locally
SERVE_LEDGERS_FROM_DATASTORE = true

# External datastore configuration for GCS
[datastore_config]
  type = "GCS"

[datastore_config.params]
  destination_bucket_path = "your-bucket/path/to/data"

[datastore_config.schema]
  ledgers_per_file = 1
  files_per_partition = 64000

[buffered_storage_backend_config]
  buffer_size = 100
  num_workers = 10
  retry_limit = 3
  retry_wait = "5s"
```

B. S3 Configuration Example

```toml
# Enable fetching historical ledgers from the datastore when not available locally
SERVE_LEDGERS_FROM_DATASTORE = true

# External datastore configuration for S3
[datastore_config]
  type = "S3"

[datastore_config.params]
  destination_bucket_path = "your-bucket/path/to/data`"
  region = "your_s3_region" # e.g., "us-east-1"

[datastore_config.schema]
  ledgers_per_file = 1
  files_per_partition = 64000

[buffered_storage_backend_config]
  buffer_size = 100
  num_workers = 10
  retry_limit = 3
  retry_wait = "5s"
```

### 3. Verifying the Setup

After configuring your RPC node, you can verify that the integration is working by making a `GetLedgers` request for a ledger sequence number that's older than your node’s standard retention window.The RPC should successfully return the ledger data from the data lake.

Example Request:

```
curl -X POST https://<rpc-host>/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "getLedgers",
    "params": {
        "startLedger": 100,
        "pagination": {
            "limit": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
