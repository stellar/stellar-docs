On August 1, 2024, the publicly accessible SDF-hosted Horizon had its historical data truncated to one year. That update optimized the performance of the publicly accessible Horizon and ensured a streamlined experience for all users. Consider third-party ecosystem providers of Horizon, which may provide a longer history retention window as well as other features.

:::

Multiple infrastructure providers have made Stellar RPC and Horizon services available, and offer plans ranging from free to dedicated instances. These providers can be used for development, testing, and production.

These providers allow access to the Futurenet, Testnet and Mainnet network.
