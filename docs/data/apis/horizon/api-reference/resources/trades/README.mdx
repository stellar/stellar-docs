import { EndpointsTable } from "@site/src/components/EndpointsTable";

When an offer is fully or partially fulfilled, a trade happens. Trades can also be caused by successful path payments, because path payments involve fulfilling offers.

A trade occurs between two parties: `base` and `counter`. Name is either arbitrary or determined by the calling query.
