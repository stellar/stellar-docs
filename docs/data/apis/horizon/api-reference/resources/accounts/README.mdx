Users interact with the Stellar network through accounts. Everything else in the ledger—assets, offers, trustlines, etc.—are owned by accounts, and accounts must authorize all changes to the ledger through signed transactions.

The [latest ledger](../../structure/consistency.mdx) known to Horizon is included as an HTTP header in the response.
