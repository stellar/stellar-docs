import { MethodTable } from "@site/src/components/MethodTable";

Horizon provides a streaming mechanism for receiving events in near real time. Instead of repeatedly sending requests to Horizon for batch updates, a connection is established between a client and Horizon with updates to an endpoint response streaming as new ledgers close and updates occur.

This reduces requests that return no data and allows near instantaneous updates client-side.

All attributes for the endpoints that allow streaming are the same as regular responses. A caller can initiate streaming by setting ‘Accept: text/event-stream’ in the HTTP header when making the request.
