Paths provide information about potential path payments. A path can be used to populate the necessary fields for a path payment operation.

The [latest ledger](../../structure/consistency.mdx) known to Horizon is included as an HTTP header in the response.

Learn more about the two types of path payment: [`path payment strict send`](../../../../../../learn/fundamentals/transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#path-payment-strict-send) and [`path payment strict receive`](../../../../../../learn/fundamentals/transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#path-payment-strict-receive)
