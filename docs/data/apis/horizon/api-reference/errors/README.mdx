After processing a request, Horizon returns a success or error response to the client. A success response will return a Status Code of 200, and an error response will return a Status Code in the range of `4XX` – `5XX` along with additional information about why the request could not complete successfully.

There are two categories of errors: [HTTP Status Codes](./http-status-codes/README.mdx) and [Result Codes](./result-codes/README.mdx). Result Codes only follow an HTTP Status Code `400` (Transaction Failed).
