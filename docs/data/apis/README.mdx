Learn about the services that provide access to real-time Stellar network data

## [RPC](./rpc/README.mdx)

The RPC provides real-time access to the current state of the Stellar network, including account balances, smart contract states, and recent transaction queries (within a seven-day retention window), while also allowing transaction submission. It is designed to be simple, minimal, and scalable, making it ideal for applications and wallets that require live data availability.

## [Horizon](./horizon/README.mdx)

Horizon is an API for accessing and interacting with Stellar network data, storing current, historical, and derived state in a single database but without smart contract data. It provides real-time data for transactional use, making it more resource-intensive to operate, and can be run independently or accessed through public infrastructure providers.
