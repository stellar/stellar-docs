Learn about the services that provide access to real-time Stellar network data

| Features                | RPC | Horizon |

| Real-time Data          | ✅  | ✅      |

\*_Please note that Horizon can provide full historical data but is not the recommended tool for full historical data access. Please use [Hubble](../analytics/hubble/README.mdx) or [Galexie](../indexers/build-your-own/galexie/README.mdx) instead._

## [RPC](./rpc/README.mdx)

The RPC provides real-time access to the current state of the Stellar network, including account balances, smart contract states, and recent transaction queries (within a seven-day retention window), while also allowing transaction submission. It is designed to be simple, minimal, and scalable, making it ideal for applications and wallets that require live data availability.

:::note

RPC is the recommended API service for all users to use.

## [Horizon](./horizon/README.mdx)

Horizon is an API for accessing and interacting with Stellar network data, storing current, historical, and derived state in a single database but with limited access to smart contract data. It provides real-time data for transactional use, making it more resource-intensive to operate, and can be run independently or accessed through public infrastructure providers. Depending on the [Horizon Provider](./api-providers.mdx), Horizon instances may contain 1 year of data or full historical data for the Stellar network.

:::warning

Horizon will provide compatibility updates with new Protocol releases but there are no plans to add new features or functionality to Horizon.
