# Oracles

Oracles are services that connect blockchain systems to external, off-chain data sources, enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world information. They act as intermediaries, fetching and verifying data such as market prices, weather conditions, or event outcomes, and then delivering it to the blockchain in a secure and reliable manner. This allows decentralized applications (dApps) to execute based on real-world events, expanding their functionality beyond on-chain data.
