Oracles exist on the Stellar network to bring off-chain data onto the blockchain. For example, a popular use-case of oracles is the inclusion of token pricing into smart contract logic. Since a smart contract can't access data from outside the Stellar network, oracles provide a means by which the data can be accessed on-chain.

## [Reflector Network](https://reflector.network)

The Reflector oracle protocol is a combination of specialized smart contracts and peer-to-peer consensus of data provider nodes maintained by trusted Stellar ecosystem organizations. Feeds include on-chain and off-chain asset prices, CEX & DEX exchange rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. Reflector nodes process, normalize, aggregate, and store trades information from Stellar Classic DEX, Soroban protocols, as well as external sources.

Publicly availble free price oracles are compatible with [SEP40](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0040.md) ecosystem standard interface. Learn how to integrate Reflector feeds [in their documentation](https://reflector.network/docs).

[Reflector Subscriptions](https://reflector.network/subscription) provide a service for user-defined customized triggers invoked automatically once the price change for a specified symbol reaches a certain threshold. When the condition is met, cluster nodes simultaneously push a notification to the WebHook URL provided in the subscription and publish an on-chain proof of the triggered event.

## [Band](https://www.bandprotocol.com/)

Band is a cross-chain data oracle aggregating and connecting real-world data and APIs to smart contracts.

The protocol is built on top of BandChain, a Cosmos-SDK-based blockchain designed to be compatible with most smart contract and blockchain development frameworks.

The network is designed to modularize and offload the task of constatly monitoring price data and react to price changes across all asset classes from the smart contract platforms onto itself. This not only prevents such tasks from congesting or causing high transaction fees on the destination network, but the same data points can be packaged, used, and verified efficiently across multiple blockchains.

## [DIA Oracles](https://www.diadata.org/)

DIA is a cross-chain oracle provider that sources granular market data from diverse exchanges, including CEXs and DEXs. Its data sourcing is thorough, enabling unparalleled transparency and customizability for resilient price feeds for 20,000+ assets. Its versatile data processing and delivery ensures adaptability and reliability for any decentralized application.

Dapps building on Soroban can utilize DIA oracles to obtain up-to-date asset price information. These deployed oracles are suitable for use in production environments. They come with a list of supported assets and settings. However, custom oracles with a different set of assets and configurations are available. If you need something that more closely fits your needs, you can [reach out to DIA](https://docs.diadata.org/introduction/request-an-oracle) to make a request.

#### Pricing methodology

The final price point for each asset is calculated by computing the assets' trade information across multiple DEXs and CEXs. This is done using a Volume Weighted Average Price with Interquartile Range (VWAPIR) methodology. [Learn more about VWAPIR](https://docs.diadata.org/products/token-price-feeds/exchangeprices/vwapir-volume-weighted-average-price-with-interquartile-range-filter).
