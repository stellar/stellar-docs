## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| transaction_hash | A hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of this transaction's XDR-encoded form. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| transaction_id | A unique identifier for this transaction. | INTEGER |  | Yes |  |
| operation_id | Unique identifier for an operation. The operation id is the transaction id + order number. | INTEGER |  | No | Null for fee events, which are emitted at the transaction grain rather than the operation grain |
| event_topic | The action type applied to the token. | STRING | transfer, mint, burn, clawback, fee | Yes |  |
| event_type | The operation type that caused the event to be emitted. Check [history-operations](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/analytics/hubble/data-catalog/data-dictionary/history-operations#column-details) to get list of operation types. | STRING |  | No |  |
| from | The source address for the token transfer event amount. The address is the account's public key encoded in base32. All account addresses start with a `G`. | STRING |  | No | Null for mint events where tokens are created without a sender |
| to | The destination address for the token transfer event amount. The address is the account's public key encoded in base32. All account addresses start with a `G`. | STRING |  | No | Null for burn events where tokens are destroyed without a recipient |
| asset | The string concatenation of (asset_type, asset_code, asset_issuer). The value of this is 'native' for the native asset/XLM. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| asset_type | The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM. | STRING |  | Yes | XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| asset_code | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network. | STRING |  | No | Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| asset_issuer | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset. | STRING |  | No |  |
| amount | The float amount of the token calculated by the amount_raw / 10^7. For Soroban contract tokens with custom decimal precision, the decimal metadata is applied instead. | FLOAT |  | Yes |  |
| amount_raw | The raw number of stroops (smallest non-zero amount unit) of the token. A single stroop is 10^-7 of a single token. | STRING |  | Yes | Data type is string. Fee events can have negative values in the case of a refund; the final net fee paid will always be positive |
| contract_id | The Soroban contract id associated with the token transfer event. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_sequence | The sequence number of this ledger. It represents the order of the ledger within the Stellar blockchain. Each ledger has a unique sequence number that increments with every new ledger, ensuring that ledgers are processed in the correct order. | INTEGER |  | Yes |  |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes |  |
| to_muxed | The multiplexed strkey representation of the `to` address. | STRING |  | No | Only populated when the destination account is a multiplexed account |
| to_muxed_id | The multiplexed ID used to generate the multiplexed strkey representation of the `to` address. | INTEGER |  | No | Only populated when the destination account is a multiplexed account |
| is_soroban | Indicates whether the event was executed out of the Soroban smart contract environment (true) or the classic environment (false). | BOOLEAN |  | Yes |  |
| unique_key | The sha256 of the concatenation of transaction_hash, operation_id, contract_id, to, to_muxed, from, and event_topic for token transfer events. | BYTES |  | Yes |  |
