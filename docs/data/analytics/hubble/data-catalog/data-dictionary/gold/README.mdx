import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

Curated analytics with friendly aggregate tables. These tables are made up of various aggregations of Stellar data such as total network TVL.

## When to use

These tables are best used for getting pre-aggregated metrics and insights for the Stellar network.

One example is the `tvl_agg` table that contains the daily TVL for the Stellar network instead of needing to aggregate TVL from each individual account, trade, liquiditiy pool, etc...
