Hubble data is organized into bronze, silver, and gold sections.

- Bronze ðŸ¥‰ - raw, untransformed data from the Stellar network (e.g., history_contract_events contains all Stellar events)
- Silver ðŸ¥ˆ - decoded, transformed, and filtered data (e.g., token_transfers contains SEP-41 complaint Stellar events)
- Gold ðŸ¥‡ - Curated analytics with friendly aggregate tables (e.g., tvl_agg aggregates the relevant amounts in Stellar events)
