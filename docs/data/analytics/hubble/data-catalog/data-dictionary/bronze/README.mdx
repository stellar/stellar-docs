Raw, untransformed data from the Stellar network. These tables break down and organize Ledger Metadata into a series of useful tables such as breaking down Ledger Metadata into history_ledgers, history_transactions, and history operations tables.

## When to use

These tables are best used for deep diving into raw Stellar data where specific custom filtering is needed.

One example is retrieving and analyzing a specific contract's data entries using the `contract_data` table.

Please check if any of the silver and gold tables work for your use case before using the bronze tables as they may incur higher BigQuery costs due to their size.
