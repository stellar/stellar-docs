## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| account_id | The address of the account. The address is the account's public key encoded in base32. All account addresses start with a `G` | string |  | Yes |  |
| balance | The number of units of XLM held by the account | float |  | Yes | The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. |
| buying_liabilities | The sum of all buy offers owned by this account for XLM only | float |  | Yes | The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. For buy offers, the account must hold the amount of asset to complete the transaction |
| selling_liabilities | The sum of all sell offers owned by this account for XLM only | float |  | Yes | The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. |
| sequence_number | The account's current sequence number. The sequence number controls operations applied to an account. Operations must submit a unique sequence number that is incremented by 1 in order to apply the operation to the account so that account changes will not collide within a ledger | integer |  | Yes |  |
| num_subentries | The total number of ledger entries connected to this account. Ledger entries include: trustlines, offers, signers, and data entries. (Claimable balances are counted under sponsoring entries, not subentries). Any newly created trustline, offer, signer or data entry will increase the number of subentries by 1. Accounts may have up to 1,000 subentries | integer |  | Yes | Each entry on a ledger takes up space, which is expensive to store on the blockchain. For each entry, an account is required to hold a [minimum XLM balance](../../../../../../learn/glossary.mdx#minimum-balance). The reserve is calculated by (2 + num_subentries - num_sponsoring + num_sponsored) \* 0.5XLM |
| inflation_destination | Deprecated: The account address to receive an inflation payment when they are disbursed on the network. | string |  | Yes | Inflation was discontinued in 2019 by validator vote. |
| flags | Denotes the enabling and disabling of certain asset issuer privileges | integer | <ul><li>0 - None, Default</li><li>1 - Auth Required (all trustlines by default are untrusted and require manual trust established)</li><li>2 - Auth Revocable (allows trustlines to be revoked if account no longer trusts asset)</li><li>4 - Auth Immutable (all auth flags are read only when set)</li><li>8 - Auth Clawback Enabled (asset can be clawed back from the user)</li></ul> | Yes | Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account |
| home_domain | The domain that hosts this account's stellar.toml file | string |  | Yes | Only applies to asset issuer accounts. The stellar.toml file contains metadata about the asset issuer which helps identify who the issuer is and instills trust in the asset |
| master_weight | The weight of the master key, which is the private key for this account. If a master key is `0,` the account is locked and cannot be used. | integer | Integers from 1 to 255 | Yes |  |
| threshold_low | The sum of the weight of all signatures that sign a transaction for the low threshold operation. The weight must exceed the set threshold for the operation to succeed. | integer |  | Yes | Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium or high. Thresholds define the level of privilege an operation needs in order to succeed (this is a security measure) Low Security: Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence and Claim Claimable Balance Medium Security: Everything Else High Security: Account Merge, Set Options |
| threshold_medium | The sum of the weight of all signatures that sign a transaction for the medium threshold operation. The weight must exceed the set threshold for the operation to succeed. | integer |  | Yes | Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium or high. Thresholds define the level of privilege an operation needs in order to succeed (this is a security measure) Low Security: Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence and Claim Claimable Balance Medium Security: Everything Else High Security: Account Merge, Set Options |
| threshold_high | The sum of the weight of all signatures that sign a transaction for the high threshold operation. The weight must exceed the set threshold for the operation to succeed. | integer |  | Yes | Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium or high. Thresholds define the level of privilege an operation needs in order to succeed (this is a security measure) Low Security: Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence and Claim Claimable Balance Medium Security: Everything Else High Security: Account Merge, Set Options |
| last_modified_ledger | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry (this unique signer for the account) was modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number | integer |  | Yes | If an account updates a signer's weight at sequence 1234 and then decides to delete the signer at 2345, the deleted record will still have a modified sequence of 1234. |
| ledger_entry_change | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry. | integer | <ul><li>0 - Ledger Entry Created</li><li>1 - Ledger Entry Updated</li><li>2 - Ledger Entry Deleted</li><li>3 - Ledger Entry State (value of the entry)</li></ul> | Yes | Valid entry change types are 0, 1, and 2 for ledger entries of type `accounts` |
| deleted | Indicates whether the ledger entry (account id) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered. | boolean |  | Yes |  |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_sequence | The sequence number of this ledger. It represents the order of the ledger within the Stellar blockchain. Each ledger has a unique sequence number that increments with every new ledger, ensuring that ledgers are processed in the correct order. | integer |  | Yes |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of `scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>`. Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| sponsor | The account address of the sponsor who is paying the reserves for this account. | string |  | No |  |
| num_sponsored | The number of reserves sponsored for this account (meaning another account is paying for the minimum balance). Sponsored entries do not incur any reserve requirement on the account that owns the entry. | integer |  | No | Defaults to 0 Accounts, offers, trustlines, data and signers can be optionally sponsored. Claimable Balances must be sponsored. See more information on sponsorship [here](../../../../../../build/guides/transactions/sponsored-reserves.mdx). |
| num_sponsoring | The number of reserves sponsored by this account. Entries sponsored by this account incur a reserve requirement | integer |  | No | Defaults to 0 Accounts, offers, trustlines, data and signers can be optionally sponsored. Claimable Balances must be sponsored. See more information on sponsorship [here](../../../../../../build/guides/transactions/sponsored-reserves.mdx). |
| sequence_ledger | The unsigned 32-bit ledger number of the sequence number's age | integer |  | No | Reflects the last time an account touched its sequence number. Note that even if the Bump Sequence operation has no effect, eg it does not increase the sequence number, it still counts as a "touch" |
| sequence_time | The UNIX timestamp of the sequence number's age | timestamp |  | No | Reflects the last time an account touched its sequence number. Note that even if the Bump Sequence operation has no effect, eg it does not increase the sequence number, it still counts as a "touch" |
