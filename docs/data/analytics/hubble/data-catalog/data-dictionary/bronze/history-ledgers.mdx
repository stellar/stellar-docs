## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sequence | The sequence number that corresponds to the individual ledgers. As ledgers are written to the network, the sequence is incremented by 1 | integer |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_hash | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash that represents the ledger's XDR-encoded form | string |  | Yes |  |
| previous_ledger_hash | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the ledger that immediately precedes this ledger | string |  | No |  |
| transaction_count | The number of successful transactions submitted and completed by the network in this ledger | integer |  | Yes | Defaults to 0 |
| operation_count | The total number of successful operations applied to this ledger | integer |  | Yes | Defaults to 0 |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| id | Unique identifier for the ledger | integer |  | Yes |  |
| total_coins | Total number of lumens in circulation | integer |  | Yes |  |
| fee_pool | The sum of all transaction fees | integer |  | Yes |  |
| base_fee | The fee (in stroops) the network charges per operation in a transaction for the given ledger. The minimum base fee is 100, with the ability to increase if transaction demand exceeds ledger capacity. When this occurs, the ledger enters surge pricing | integer |  | Yes | The stroop is the fractional representation of a lumen (XLM). 1 stroop is 0.0000001 XLM. |
| base_reserve | The reserve (in stroops) the network requires an account to retain as a minimum balance in order to be a valid account on the network. The current minimum reserve is 10 XLM | integer | 5000000 100000000 | Yes | The stroop is the fractional representation of a lumen (XLM). 1 stroop is 0.0000001 XLM. |
| max_tx_set_size | The maximum number of operations that Stellar validator nodes have agreed to process in a given ledger. Since Protocol 11, ledger capacity has been measured in operations rather than transactions | integer | 50 - original max 500 1000 - current max | Yes |  |
| protocol_version | The protocol verstion that the Stellar network was running when this ledger was committed. Protocol versions are released ~every 6 months | integer | integers 1 - 19 (will increment) | Yes | Defaults to 0 |
| ledger_header | A base64-encoded string of the raw LedgerHeader xdr struct for this ledger | bytes |  | No |  |
| successful_transaction_count | The number of successful transactions submitted and completed by the network in this ledger | integer |  | No |  |
| failed_transaction_count | The number of failed transactions submitted to the network in this ledger. The transaction was still paid for but contained an error that prevented it from executing | integer |  | No |  |
| tx_set_operation_count | The total number of operations in the transaction set for this ledger, including failed transactions. | integer |  | No | Transactions on Stellar are atomic. If one of the operations within a transaction set fails, the entire transaction will failed, including any other operations. |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of `scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>`. Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| soroban_fee_write_1kb | Soroban write fee costs | integer |  | No |  |
| signature | The signing hash of the validator node which writes the transaction set to the network.This signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the ledger, confirming that it has not been tampered with | string |  | Yes |  |
| node_id | The id of winning validator node which is allowed to write transaction set to the network. The winning validator is decided by the network | string |  | Yes |  |
| total_byte_size_of_bucket_list | The size, in bytes, of the Bucketlist DB for the Stellar Network | integer |  | Yes |  |
| evicted_ledger_keys_type | The list of type of keys which have been evicted in a given ledger entry. | string |  | No |  |
| evicted_ledger_keys_hash | The list of keys hash which have been evicted in a given ledger entry. | string |  |  | No |  |
