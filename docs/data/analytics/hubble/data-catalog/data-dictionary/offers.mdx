| priced | The denominator of the precise representation of the buy and sell price of assets on offer (The sell amount offered) | integer |  | Yes | If an offer wants to sell 10 XLM in exchange for 1 USD, the denominator will be 10. |
| price | How many units of buying it takes to get 1 unit of selling. This number is the decimal form of pricen / priced | float |  | Yes | If an offer wants to sell 10 XLM in exchange for 1 USD, the price will be 0.1 |

| ledger_entry_change | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry. | integer | <ul><li>0 - Ledger Entry Created</li><li>1 - Ledger Entry Updated</li><li>2 - Ledger Entry Deleted</li><li>3 - Ledger Entry State (value of the entry)</li></ul> | Yes | Valid entry change types are 0, 1, and 2 for ledger entries of type `offers`. |

| sponsor | The account address that is sponsoring the base reserves for the offer | string |  | No |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
