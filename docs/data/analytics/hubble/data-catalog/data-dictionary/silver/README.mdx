Decoded, transformed, and filtered data. These tables transform the bronze tables into easier to use tables by joining and flattening tables and filtering out information for specific use cases.

## When to use

These tables are best used for a more curated experience while still needing to search and filter for specific use cases such as information on a specific contract.

One example is getting relevant Stellar events to calculate circulating supply by using the `token_transfers_raw` table. In theory you can get the same information from the bronze `history_contract_events` table but the `token_transfers_raw` table has already processed, filtered, and flattened the events relevant to SEP-41 events and classic operations.

## Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)

Some silver tables are modeled as [SCD Type 2](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dbt-public/blob/master/docs/snapshot.md) tables. This means they track the full history of changes to a record over time by keeping multiple versions with `valid_from` / `valid_to` ranges.

These tables are especially useful for answering historical questions such as:

- What was the state of a contract at a given point in time?
- How did an account, trustline, or balance evolve across different periods?
- Which liquidity pools were active at a given date, and how did their properties change over time?

> **_NOTE:_** Daily Snapshot Frequency: Snapshots run on a daily basis, meaning they capture inter-day changes, but not multiple changes that occur within the same day.
