import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

Decoded, transformed, and filtered data. These tables transform the bronze tables into easier to use tables by joining and flattening tables and filtering out information for specific use cases.

## When to use

These tables are best used for a more curated experience while still needing to search and filter for specific use cases such as information on a specific contract.

One example is getting relevant Stellar events to calculate circulating supply by using the `token_transfers_raw` table. In theory you can get the same information from the bronze `history_contract_events` table but the `token_transfers_raw` table has already processed, filtered, and flattened the events relevant to SEP-41 events and classic operations.
