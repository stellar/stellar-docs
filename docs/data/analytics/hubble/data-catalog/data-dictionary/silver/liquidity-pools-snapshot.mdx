## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| liquidity_pool_id | Unique identifier for a liquidity pool. | STRING |  | Yes | Natural Key. Cluster Field. Cannot be duplicated for same asset pair. |
| type | Mechanism that calculates pricing and division of shares for the pool. | STRING | constant_product | Yes | Initially only constant product pools are supported. See [Cap-38](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0038.md). |
| fee | Basis points charged as trade fee. | INTEGER | Default = 30 | Yes | Fees are distributed immediately to accounts as transactions complete. |
| trustline_count | Total number of accounts with trustlines authorized to the pool. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Revoking authorization on an asset will withdraw accounts from all pools with that asset. |
| pool_share_count | Total number of pool shares representing participation in the liquidity pool. | FLOAT |  | Yes | Shares are not transferable. Can only be adjusted via deposit/withdraw. |
| asset_a_type | Asset type for one side of the pool (sold asset). | STRING | <ul><li>credit_alphanum4</li><li>credit_alphanum12</li><li>native</li></ul> | Yes | XLM has type = 'native'. No asset code/issuer. |
| asset_a_code | Asset code (4 or 12 chars) for sold asset in trade. | STRING |  | No | Asset codes alone are not unique. Combination with issuer + type is unique. |
| asset_a_issuer | Account address of the original issuer of the sold asset. | STRING |  | No |  |
| asset_a_id | Farm Hash encoding of asset code + issuer + type for asset A. | INTEGER |  | No |  |
| asset_a_amount | Raw number of tokens locked in the pool for asset A. | FLOAT |  | Yes |  |
| asset_b_type | Asset type for the other side of the pool. | STRING | <ul><li>credit_alphanum4</li><li>credit_alphanum12</li><li>native</li></ul> | Yes | XLM has type = 'native'. |
| asset_b_code | Asset code (4 or 12 chars) for other asset in trade. | STRING |  | No | Asset codes alone are not unique. Combination with issuer + type is unique. |
| asset_b_issuer | Account address of the original issuer of the other asset. | STRING |  | No |  |
| asset_b_id | Farm Hash encoding of asset code + issuer + type for asset B. | INTEGER |  | No |  |
| asset_b_amount | Raw number of tokens locked in the pool for asset B. | FLOAT |  | Yes |  |
| last_modified_ledger | Ledger sequence number when the pool entry was last modified. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Natural Key. Cluster Field. Deletion does not count as modification. |
| ledger_entry_change | Code describing the ledger entry change type. | INTEGER | <ul><li>0 - Ledger Entry Created</li><li>1 - Ledger Entry Updated</li><li>2 - Ledger Entry Deleted</li><li>3 - Ledger Entry State (value of the entry)</li></ul> | Yes | Updates not valid for claimable balances. |
| deleted | Indicates whether the liquidity pool entry was deleted. | BOOLEAN | true, false | Yes | Deleted entries cannot be recovered; history is maintained. |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of `scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>`. Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | Start date for the batch interval. | DATETIME |  | Yes | Proxy for closed_at. |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when ledger closed and committed. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes | Ledgers close ~every 5 seconds. |
| ledger_sequence | Ledger sequence number. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Represents order of ledger within Stellar blockchain. |
| batch_insert_ts | Timestamp in UTC when batch was inserted into DB. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes | Used for engineering/debugging, not analysis. |
| airflow_start_ts | Timestamp when airflow job started. | STRING |  | Yes | Helps detect backfill loads. |
| valid_from | Timestamp when this snapshot row became effective. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes | Helps track changes over time. |
| valid_to | Timestamp when this row is no longer valid. | TIMESTAMP |  | No | Null = still active. |

## Example Business Questions

1. What was the total liquidity (asset_a_amount + asset_b_amount) across all pools on a given date?

```sql
SELECT
  DATE('2025-01-15') AS as_of_date,
  SUM(asset_a_amount + asset_b_amount) AS total_liquidity
FROM `crypto-stellar.snapshots.liquidity_pools_snapshot`
WHERE DATE(valid_from) <= DATE('2025-01-15')
  AND (DATE(valid_to) > DATE('2025-01-15') OR valid_to IS NULL)
  AND deleted = FALSE;
```
