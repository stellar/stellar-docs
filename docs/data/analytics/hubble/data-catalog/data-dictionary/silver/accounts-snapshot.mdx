## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| account_id | The unique identifier of the account. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| balance | The number of units of XLM held by the account. | FLOAT |  | Yes | The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. |
| buying_liabilities | The sum of all buy offers owned by this account for XLM only. | FLOAT |  | Yes | The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. For buy offers, the account must hold the amount of asset to complete the transaction. |
| selling_liabilities | The sum of all sell offers owned by this account for XLM only. | FLOAT |  | Yes | The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. |
| sequence_number | The account's current sequence number. The sequence number controls operations applied to an account. Operations must submit a unique sequence number that is incremented by 1. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Natural Key. Required Field. |
| num_subentries | The total number of ledger entries connected to this account. Ledger entries include: trustlines, offers, signers, and data entries. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Each entry on a ledger takes up space, which is expensive to store. Minimum balance is calculated by (2 + num_subentries - num_sponsoring + num_sponsored) \* 0.5XLM. |
| inflation_destination | Deprecated: The account address to receive an inflation payment when disbursed. | STRING |  | Yes | Inflation was discontinued in 2019 by validator vote. |
| flags | Denotes enabling/disabling of certain asset issuer privileges. | INTEGER | <ul><li>0 - None, Default</li><li>1 - Auth Required (all trustlines by default are untrusted and require manual trust established)</li><li>2 - Auth Revocable (allows trustlines to be revoked if account no longer trusts asset)</li><li>4 - Auth Immutable (all auth flags are read only when set)</li><li>8 - Auth Clawback Enabled (asset can be clawed back from the user)</li></ul> | Yes | Flags can have values: 0=None, 1=Auth Required, 2=Auth Revocable, 4=Auth Immutable, 8=Auth Clawback Enabled. |
| home_domain | URL of home domain linked to wallet. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| master_weight | The weight of the master key, which is the private key for this account. | INTEGER | Integers from 1 to 255 | Yes | If master key = 0, account is locked. |
| threshold_low | The sum of the weight of all signatures required for low threshold operations. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Low: Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence, Claim Claimable Balance. |
| threshold_medium | The sum of the weight of all signatures required for medium threshold operations. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Medium: Everything Else. |
| threshold_high | The sum of the weight of all signatures required for high threshold operations. | INTEGER |  | Yes | High: Account Merge, Set Options. |
| last_modified_ledger | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry was last modified. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Natural Key. Cluster Field. Deletion does not count as modification. |
| ledger_entry_change | Code describing the ledger entry change type applied. | INTEGER | <ul><li>0 - Ledger Entry Created</li><li>1 - Ledger Entry Updated</li><li>2 - Ledger Entry Deleted</li><li>3 - Ledger Entry State (value of the entry)</li></ul> | Yes | Values: 0=Created, 1=Updated (not valid for claimable balances), 2=Deleted. |
| deleted | Indicates whether the ledger entry has been deleted. | BOOLEAN |  | Yes | Once deleted, cannot be recovered. |
| sponsor | The account address of the sponsor paying the reserves for this ledger entry. | STRING |  | No | Sponsors can be accounts, signers, claimable balances, trust lines. |
| num_sponsored | The number of reserves sponsored for this account. | INTEGER |  | No | Defaults to 0. |
| num_sponsoring | The number of reserves sponsored by this account. | INTEGER |  | No | Defaults to 0. |
| sequence_ledger | The unsigned 32-bit ledger number of the sequence number's age. | INTEGER |  | No | Reflects the last time an account touched its sequence number. |
| sequence_time |  | TIMESTAMP |  | No |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of `scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>`. Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. | DATETIME |  | Yes | Represents the interval of ledgers processed. |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes | Ledgers close ~every 5 seconds. |
| ledger_sequence | The sequence number of this ledger. | INTEGER |  | Yes | Cluster Field. Unique per ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes | Useful for data engineering, not for ad hoc analysis. |
| airflow_start_ts | The timestamp when the airflow job starts. | STRING |  | Yes | Used to detect backfill jobs. |
| valid_from | The timestamp when this snapshot row was first inserted and became effective. | TIMESTAMP |  | Yes | Helps track changes over time. |
| valid_to | The timestamp when this row is no longer valid. | TIMESTAMP |  | No | If null, the setting is currently active. |

## Example Business Questions

1. Point-in-time query (as-of balance)

```sql
SELECT account_id, balance
FROM `crypto-stellar.snapshots.accounts_snapshot`
WHERE account_id = 'ACC123'
  DATE('2025-01-15') BETWEEN DATE(valid_from) AND COALESCE(DATE(valid_to), '9999-12-31')
LIMIT 100
```

2. Active snapshot (current records only)

```sql
SELECT account_id, balance, home_domain
FROM `crypto-stellar.snapshots.accounts_snapshot`
WHERE valid_to IS NULL
LIMIT 100
```

3. Changes in February 2025 (partition pruning)

```sql
SELECT account_id, COUNT(*) AS num_changes
FROM `crypto-stellar.snapshots.accounts_snapshot`
WHERE DATE_TRUNC(valid_to, MONTH) = '2025-02-01'
GROUP BY account_id
LIMIT 100
```
