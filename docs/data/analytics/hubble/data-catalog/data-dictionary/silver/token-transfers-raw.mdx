## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| transaction_hash | A hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of this transaction's XDR-encoded form. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| transaction_id | A unique identifier for this transaction. | INTEGER |  | Yes |  |
| operation_id | A unique identifier for this transaction. | INTEGER |  | No |  |
| event_topic | The action type applied to the token. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| from | The source address for the token transfer event amount. | STRING |  | No |  |
| to | The destination address for the token transfer event amount. | STRING |  | No |  |
| asset | ID field for the asset code/issuer pair. It is created by concatenating the asset code, ':' and asset_issuer fields. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| asset_type | The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network (XLM). | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| asset_code | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network. | STRING |  | No |  |
| asset_issuer | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset. | STRING |  | No |  |
| amount | The normalized float amount of the asset. | FLOAT |  | Yes |  |
| amount_raw | The raw stroop amount of the asset. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| contract_id | Soroban contract id. | STRING |  | Yes |  |
| to_muxed | The multiplexed strkey representation of the `to` address. | STRING |  | No |  |
| to_muxed_id | The multiplexed ID used to generate the multiplexed strkey representation of the `to` address. | STRING |  | No |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  | Yes |  |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_sequence | The sequence number of this ledger. It represents the order of the ledger within the Stellar blockchain. Each ledger has a unique sequence number that increments with every new ledger, ensuring that ledgers are processed in the correct order. | integer |  | Yes |  |
