## Architecture Overview

In general stellar-etl runs by:

- Read raw data from the Stellar network
- This can be done by running a stellar-etl export command to export data between a start and end ledger
  - stellar-etl has the ability to read from two different sources:
    - Captive-core directly to get LedgerCloseMeta
    - A data lake of compressed LedgerCloseMeta files from Ledger Exporter
- Tranforms the LedgerCloseMeta XDR into an easy to parse JSON format
- Optionally uploads the JSON files to GCS or any other cloud storage service

More detailed information about stellar-etl and examples can be found in the [stellar-etl](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl/tree/master) repo.
