## Architecture Overview

<img src="/assets/hubble/stellar-etl-airflow-architecture.png" width="300" />

In general `stellar-etl-airflow` runs by:

- Scheduling DAGs to run `stellar-etl` and upload the data outputted to BigQuery
- Scheduling DAGs to run `stellar-dbt-public` using the data in BigQuery
  - We try to adhere to the best practices set by the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects)

More detailed information about stellar-etl-airflow can be found in the [stellar-etl-airflow](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl-airflow/tree/master) repo.
