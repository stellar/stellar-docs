title: "Queries for Horizon/RPC-like Data"
sidebar_position: 50
---

[Horizon](../../../apis/horizon/README.mdx) and [RPC](../../../apis/rpc/README.mdx) both provide API endpoints to retrieve data from the Stellar network. The following example queries retrieve the same data by using Hubble with the added benefit of being able to return historical data.

## Accounts

[horizon/accounts](../../../apis/horizon/api-reference/resources/accounts/README.mdx)

Users interact with the Stellar network through accounts. Everything else in the ledger—assets, offers, trustlines, etc.—are owned by accounts, and accounts must authorize all changes to the ledger through signed transactions.

Learn more about [accounts](../../../../learn/glossary.mdx#account).

## Assets

[horizon/assets](../../../apis/horizon/api-reference/resources/assets/README.mdx)

Assets are representations of value issued on the Stellar network. An asset consists of a type, code, and issuer.

Learn more about [assets](../../../../learn/glossary.mdx#asset).

```

## Claimable Balances

[horizon/claimable_balances](../../../apis/horizon/api-reference/resources/claimablebalances/README.mdx)

A Claimable Balance represents the transfer of ownership of some amount of an asset. Claimable balances provide a mechanism for setting up a payment which can be claimed in the future. This allows you to make payments to accounts which are currently not able to accept them.

## Operations

[horizon/operations](../../../apis/horizon/api-reference/resources/operations/README.mdx)

## Trades

[horizon/trades](../../../apis/horizon/api-reference/resources/trades/README.mdx)

When an offer is fully or partially fulfilled, a trade happens. Trades can also be caused by successful path payments, because path payments involve fulfilling offers.

A trade occurs between two parties—`base` and `counter`. Which is which is either arbitrary or determined by the calling query.

## Trade Aggregations

[horizon/trade_aggregations](../../../apis/horizon/api-reference/aggregations/trade-aggregations/README.mdx)
