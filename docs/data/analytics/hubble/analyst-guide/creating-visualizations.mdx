This page will show how you can create visualizations with Hubble and [Google Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio?hl=en).

By the end of the tutorial you will have created two graphs that will help visualize temporary VS persistent contract data entry distribution and expiration.

<img src={hubble_visualization_demo} width="1000" />

As you can see, persistent contract data entries account for roughly 25% of all contract data entries with the rest being temporary. There are also a lot more expired temporary contract data entries. This is expected because temporay entries cannot be bumped whereas persistent entries can be bumped/restored. For more information, you can read about [State Archival and the Contract Data Lifecycle](../../../../learn/fundamentals/contract-development/storage/state-archival.mdx#contract-data-type-descriptions).

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have connected to Hubble by following the instructions in the [Connecting](../developer-guide/connecting-to-bigquery/README.mdx) page
2. You have access to [Google Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio?hl=en)
3. You have read and understand the general [Best Practices](./optimizing-queries.mdx#best-practices) for querying BigQuery data

## Create a Report in Looker Studio

### Attach Data Sources to Looker Studio

1. Select `Create --> Data source`

<img src={create_data_source} width="200" />

2. Find and select the `BigQuery Google Connector`

<img src={bq_connector} width="300" />

3. Find the desired tables that you want to connect. For this example you will want to add a data source for:
   1. `crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar.contract_data`

<img src={add_contract_data} width="600" />

### Create a New Report (Dashboard)

1. Select `Create --> Report`

<img src={create_report} width="200" />

2. Add your data sources from above

<img src={select_data_sources} width="300" />

3. Insert a `Pie chart`

<img src={add_pie_chart} width="200" />

4. Choose `contract_data` as the `Data source`

<img src={pie_contract_data} width="300" />

5. Choose `closed_at` as the `Date Range Dimension` and `contract_durability` as the `Dimension`

<img src={pie_config} width="300" />

6. You should now have a pie chart showing the percentage of Temporary VS Persistent Contract Data Durability

<img src={pie_chart_durability} width="500" />

### Use Custom SQL to Create a Chart

1. In your report, click `Add Data` which will be near the bottom right of your window

<img src={click_add_data} width="500" />

2. Select `BigQuery` and choose `CUSTOM QUERY` and select your desired `Billing Project` where the query will be charged

<img src={add_custom_query} width="500" />

3. Add the following query and click `Add`

```sql
-- Find the latest ledger sequence within Hubble.
-- This may be slightly behind the actual Stellar latest ledger
-- because Hubble is scheduled to run and insert data at 10 minute intervals
with latest_ledger_in_hubble as (
  select
    max(sequence) as latest_ledger_sequence
  from `crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar.history_ledgers`
),

-- Find all the ttl that have expired
expired_ttl as (
  select
    key_hash
    , live_until_ledger_seq
    -- Saving the date to aggregate on at the final step of the query
    , date(closed_at) as ledger_date
  from `crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar_dbt.ttl_current`
  where true
    -- Filter for expired entries only with the use of latest_ledger_sequence
    and live_until_ledger_seq < (select latest_ledger_sequence from latest_ledger_in_hubble)
)

-- Aggregate based on the month and contract durability type
select
  date_trunc(et.ledger_date, month) as month_agg
  , cd.contract_durability
  , count(1) as expired_entry_count
from expired_ttl as et
  join `crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar_dbt.contract_data_current` as cd
    on et.key_hash = cd.ledger_key_hash
where true
  -- Optionally filter for a specific date/date range
  and et.ledger_date between '2024-02-01' and '2024-10-31'
group by 1,2
order by 1 desc, 2
```

4. Insert `Column chart`

<img src={add_column_chart} width="200" />

5. Select the following:

- `BigQuery Custom SQL` as your `Data source`
- `month_agg` as the `Dimension`
- `contract_durability` as the `Breakdown Dimension`
- `expired_entry_count` as the `Metric`

<img src={column_chart_config} width="300" />

6. You should now have a column chart (bar chart) showing the expired Soroban contract entries

<img src={expired_entry_column_chart} width="500" />

### Applying a Global Filter

1. Click `+Add quick filter` to apply a filter throughout the whole report

<img src={add_quick_filter} width="500" />

2. Select `contract_durability` to filter by `contract_durability` values

<img src={filter_contract} width="500" />

3. Select only `ContractDataDurabilityPersistent` and click `Apply`

<img src={persistent_only} width="500" />

4. Your charts should now be filtered and show only `ContractDataDurabilityPersistent` data

<img src={filtered_report} width="500" />
