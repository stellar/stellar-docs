A ledger backend is a source of Stellar network ledger data. he ingest library supports two primary ledger backends, both implementing the [ledgerbackend](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledgerbackend/ledger_backend.go) interface. This interface always returns ledger data as `xdr.LedgerCloseMeta`, which is XDR-encoded ledger metadata object.

1. **Captive Core** – Runs a Stellar Core instance which connects to the live Stellar network and fetches network data (i.e., ledgers).
2. **BufferedStorageBackend (Data lake of pre-generated ledger metadata)** – Fetches pre-exported ledger metadata from cloud storage.

Each backend has its own setup and configuration requirements, which are covered in the following sections.
