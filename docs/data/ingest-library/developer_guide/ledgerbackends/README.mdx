A ledger backend is a source of Stellar network ledger data. The ingest SDK supports two primary ledger backends, both implementing the [ledgerbackend](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledgerbackend/ledger_backend.go) interface. This interface always returns ledger data as `xdr.LedgerCloseMeta`, which is XDR-encoded ledger metadata object.

1. **[Captive Core](/docs/data/ingest-library/developer_guide/ledgerbackends/captivecore)** – Invokes the `stellar-core` binary as a subprocess which connects to the live Stellar network and fetches network data (i.e., ledgers).
2. **[BufferedStorageBackend](/docs/data/ingest-library/developer_guide/ledgerbackends/bufferedstoragebackend)** – Retrieves ledger metadata from cloud storage.

Each backend has its own setup and configuration requirements, which are covered in the following sections.
