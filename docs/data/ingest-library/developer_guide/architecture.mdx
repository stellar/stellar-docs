## Ingest SDK Structure

Ingest SDK is organized into three main components:

1. **[Ledger Backends](/docs/data/ingest-library/developer_guide/ledgerbackends)**: Used to stream ledgers from the Stellar network. `https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/ingest/ledgerbackend`
2. **[Ledger Readers](/docs/data/ingest-library/developer_guide/ledgerreaders)** : Iterators to extract individual changes or transactions from a ledger. `https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/ingest`
3. **[Ledger Processors](/docs/data/ingest-library/developer_guide/ledgerprocessors)** : Functions to process individual changes or transactions and extract meaningful data such as accounts, offers, claimable balance, etc. They are used in conjunction with `Ledger Readers` to interpret and transform ledger data. `https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/ingest/processors`
