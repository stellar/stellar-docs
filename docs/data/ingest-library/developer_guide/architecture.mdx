## Package Structure

The ingest library is broadly split into three main packages:

1. **Ledger Backends**: Used to stream ledgers from the Stellar network.
2. **Ledger Readers**: Utility classes that help iterate through individual changes or transactions in a ledger.
3. **Ledger Processors**: Functions to process individual changes or transactions and extract meaningful data such as offers, claimable balance, etc.
