## What is the Ingest Library?

The library is a programmatic SDK in the Go programming language composed of several packages for acquiring and parsing data from the Stellar network. It provides language level bindings which convert the [binary XDR encoded](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/data-format/xdr) streams emitted from the network into fluent programmatic data model bindings.

## Why use the Ingest Library?

Applications can leverage the library to rapidly develop ingestion pipelines capable of acquiring real-time or historical Stellar network data and deriving custom data models. The library enables applications to traverse the hierarchal data structures of the network: [history archives](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/validators/admin-guide/environment-preparation#history-archives), [ledgers](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/ledgers), transactions, operations, ledger state changes, and events.

Use the library for an intuitive, compile-time, type-safe developer experience to work with the main types of network data:

### Ledger Entries

Obtain the final state of all ledger entries on the network at close of any recent or historically aged checkpoint ledger sequence. A Checkpoint ledger occurs once every 64 ledgers, during which the network will publish this data to [history archives](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/validators/admin-guide/environment-preparation#history-archives) in the format of compressed files which contain lists of `BucketEntry`, wherein each contains one `LedgerEntry` and the `LedgerKey`.

### Ledger Metadata

Gain access to all transactions and their nested operations which were included in each closed ledger. It also contains the changes(pre/post) for each ledger entry when it is changed due to transaction activity and all [Soroban contract events](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/events) emitted as a result of [contract](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/contracts) invocations during transaction execution. It is effectively a commit log for ledger entries.

Ledger Metadata is the origin for any ingestion pipeline that wants to derive historical or current state models from stellar network. The library provides packages which clients can use to consume the metadata in streaming data format, with readers and callback functions.

The streams of ledger metadata can be sourced in unbounded fashion as ongoing real-time ledgers close on the Stellar network, and also in a historical replay mode with a bounded range of past ledger sequences.
