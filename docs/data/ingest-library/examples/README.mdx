This section showcases real-world use cases of the Ingest Library, focusing on key components like `ingest.LedgerTransaction`, `ingest.LedgerChange`, `ingest.LedgerTransactionReader`, and `ingest.ChangeReader`.

These examples take a Stellar Ledger (`xdr.LedgerCloseMeta`) or a ledger sequence range (start-end) as input. Each of the examples listed here is complete, and can be compiled and run as-is in your IDE/local dev.

## Prerequisites

Some of the examples listed here might invoke the `stellar-core` binary. Refer to the "admin guide" for more details on how to compile `stellar-core` for your platform.
