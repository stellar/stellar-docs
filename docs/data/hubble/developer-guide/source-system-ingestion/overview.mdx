Stellar network data ingestion in Hubble is done through [stellar-etl](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl/tree/master). stellar-etl reads and transforms Stellar network data into OLAP friendly JSON files.

| Use Case | Recommended Solution | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Need commonly required data fields and do not want to take burden of setting up entire pipeline | Use output from SDF's stellar-etl instance i.e. [Connect to Bigquery and access hubble](../../developer-guide/connecting-to-bigquery/README.mdx) | It is worth noting that most users will not need to standup and run their own stellar-etl instance. The Stellar Development Foundation provides public access to fully transformed Stellar network data through the public datasets and tables in GCP BigQuery. |
| Need custom data but do not want to take burden of setting up entire pipeline | Use [JS-UDF](../../developer-guide/backfill/JS-UDF.mdx) | Stellar-ETL does not parse every single field available in raw XDR, but it does save the raw transaction meta. JS-UDF helps to extract a field directly from XDR |
| Need custom and operationally independent data | Run [stellar-etl](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl/tree/master) | Running stellar-etl within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can: <br></br> - Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation for network data <br></br> - Run modified ETL/ELT pipelines that fit your individual business needs |
