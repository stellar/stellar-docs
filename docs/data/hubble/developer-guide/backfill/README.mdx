Once your scheduling and orchestration are set up, you might encounter the following scenarios:

- **Bug Fix:** You resolve a bug and need to re-ingest a specific data column.
- **New Feature:** You add a new data column as part of a feature request and need to backfill data for the newly added column.
- **Raw Data Extraction:** You want to use Hubble as a source for raw data (XDR columns) and extract only the required data columns. For scenarios 1 and 2, you can perform a backfill using Airflow and trigger a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for past dates.

However, if you need to address any of the three use cases mentioned, you can also use a JavaScript UDF (User Defined Function).

**Advantages of Using JavaScript UDFs** **Speed and Cost:** JavaScript UDFs are faster and more cost-effective compared to Airflow backfills, as they allow you to re-ingest only the relevant columns.

**Considerations for Using JavaScript UDFs** **Efficient Query Writing:** To ensure performance, it's important to write your query efficiently and process the data in batches.
