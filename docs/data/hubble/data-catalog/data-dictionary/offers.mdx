| batch_id             | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>".

| batch_run_date       | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger.   | datetime  |                                                                                                                                 |              |              | MONTH partition             | Yes       | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts      | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database.
