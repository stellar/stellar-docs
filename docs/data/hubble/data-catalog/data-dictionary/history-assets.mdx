| asset_id | Unique identifier for asset_code, asset_issuer | integer |  | No |  |
| asset_type | The identifier for type of asset code, can be a alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM. | string | <ul><li>credit_alphanum4</li><li>credit_alphanum12</li><li>native</li></ul> | Yes | XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| asset_code | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network | string |  | No | Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| asset_issuer | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset | string |  | No |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
