| balance | The number of units of an asset held by this account | float |  | Yes |  |

| ledger_entry_change | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry | integer | <ul><li>0 - Ledger Entry Created</li><li>1 - Ledger Entry Updated</li><li>2 - Ledger Entry Deleted</li><li>3 - Ledger Entry State</li></ul> | Yes | Valid entry change types are 0, 1, and 2 for ledger entries of type `trust_lines`. |

| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed | datetime |  | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
