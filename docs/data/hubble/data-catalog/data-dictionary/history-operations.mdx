| details.parameters_decoded | The decoded human readable parameters passed to a function call for a Soroban contract. The record follows the format of \`type\` + \`value\` pair | record |  | 24 - Invoke Host Function |  |  |  | No |  |
| details.function | The function type invoked by the host operation | string | HostFunctionTypeHostFunctionTypeInvokeContract HostFunctionTypeHostFunctionTypeCreateContract HostFunctionTypeHostFunctionTypeUploadContractWasm | 24 - Invoke Host Function |  |  |  | No |  |
| details.address | The wallet address used to create and deploy a Soroban contract instance. | string |  | 24 - Invoke Host Function |  |  |  | No |  |
| details.type | The type of Soroban operation that is invoked within a host function | string | invoke_contract create_contract upload_wasm extend_footprint_ttl restore_footprint | 24 - Invoke Host Function 25 - Extend Footprint Ttl 26 - Restore Footprint |  |  |  | No |  |
| details.extend_to | The number of ledgers in which the Soroban ledger entry is extended | integer |  | 25 - Extend Footprint Ttl |  |  |  | No |  |
| details.contract_id | The unique identifier of the deployed contract instance. Each custom Soroban contract and deployed SAC token will have a unique contract_id. | string |  | 24 - Invoke Host Function 25 - Extend Footprint Ttl 26 - Restore Footprint |  |  |  | No |  |
| details.contract_code_hash | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash that represents the contract code's XDR-encoded form | string |  | 24 - Invoke Host Function 25 - Extend Footprint Ttl 26 - Restore Footprint |  |  |  | No |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  |  |  |  | MONTH partition | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds | timestamp |  |  |  |  |  | Yes | We are aiming to repartition this table on closed_at |
| operation_result_code | The result code returned when an operation is applied. This code is helpful for understanding failed operations. | string | OperationResultCodeOpInner OperationResultCodeOpBadAuth OperationResultCodeOpNoAccount OperationResultCodeOpNotSupported OperationResultCodeOpTooManySubentries OperationResultCodeOpExceededWorkLimit OperationResultCodeOpTooManySponsoring |  |  |  |  | Yes | Field will be backfilled at a future date |
| operation_trace_code | The trace code returned when an operation is applied to the Stellar Network. This code is helpful for understanding nuanced failures by operation type. This code provides the lowest level detail regarding why a transaction fails. | string | InvokeHostFunctionResultCodeInvokeHostFunction Success Malformed Trapped ResourceLimitExceeded EntryArchived InsufficientRefundableFee ExtendFootprintTtlResultCodeExtendFootprintTtl Success Malformed ResourceLimitExceeded InsufficientRefundableFee RestoreFootprintResultCodeRestoreFootprint Success Malformed ResourceLimitExceeded InsufficientRefundableFee | All operations, only Soroban Operation types are detailed (see notes for more) |  |  |  | Yes | See the XDR [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stellar/go/xdr#OperationResultTr) for more details |
