| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Primary Key? | Natural Key? | Partition or Cluster Field? | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| contract_id | Soroban contract id | string |  |  | Yes | Cluster | Yes |  |
| contract_key_type | Contract key type which is an ScVal that can have the following values | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| contract_durability | Contract can either be temporary or persistent | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| asset_code | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network. | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| asset_issuer | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset. | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| asset_type | The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM. | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| balance_holder | The address/account that holds the balance of the asset in contract data | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| balance | The number of units of XLM held by the account | string |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| last_modified_ledger | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry (this unique signer for the account) was modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number | integer |  |  | Yes | Cluster | Yes |  |
| ledger_entry_change | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry. | integer |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| deleted | Indicates whether the ledger entry (balance id) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered. | boolean |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| closed_at | The UNIX timestamp of the sequence number's age | timestamp |  |  |  | Partition | Yes |  |
| ledger_sequence | The unsigned 32-bit ledger number of the sequence number's age | integer |  |  | Yes |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_key_hash | Ledger key hash used to identify expiring contract data or contract code ledger entries | string |  |  | Yes |  | Yes |  |
