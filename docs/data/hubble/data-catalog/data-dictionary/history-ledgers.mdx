| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Primary Key? | Natural Key? | Partition or Cluster Field? | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sequence | The sequence number that corresponds to the individual ledgers. As ledgers are written to the network, the sequence is incremented by 1 | integer |  |  | Yes | cluster | Yes |  |
| ledger_hash | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash that represents the ledger's XDR-encoded form | string |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| previous_ledger_hash | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the ledger that immediately precedes this ledger | string |  |  |  |  | No |  |
| transaction_count | The number of successful transactions submitted and completed by the network in this ledger | integer |  |  |  |  | Yes | Defaults to 0 |
| operation_count | The total number of successful operations applied to this ledger | integer |  |  |  |  | Yes | Defaults to 0 |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds | timestamp |  |  | Yes | cluster, MONTH partition | Yes |  |
| id | Unique identifier for the ledger | integer |  | Yes |  |  | No |  |
| total_coins | Total number of lumens in circulation | integer |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| fee_pool | The sum of all transaction fees | integer |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| base_fee | The fee (in stroops) the network charges per operation in a transaction for the given ledger. The minimum base fee is 100, with the ability to increase if transaction demand exceeds ledger capacity. When this occurs, the ledger enters surge pricing | integer |  |  |  |  | Yes | The stroop is the fractional representation of a lumen (XLM). 1 stroop is 0.0000001 XLM. |
| base_reserve | The reserve (in stroops) the network requires an account to retain as a minimum balance in order to be a valid account on the network. The current minimum reserve is 10 XLM | integer | 5000000 100000000 |  |  |  | Yes | The stroop is the fractional representation of a lumen (XLM). 1 stroop is 0.0000001 XLM. |
| max_tx_set_size | The maximum number of operations that Stellar validator nodes have agreed to process in a given ledger. Since Protocol 11, ledger capacity has been measured in operations rather than transactions | integer | 50 - original max 500 1000 - current max |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| protocol_version | The protocol verstion that the Stellar network was running when this ledger was committed. Protocol versions are released ~every 6 months | integer | integers 1 - 19 (will increment) |  |  |  | Yes | Defaults to 0 |
| ledger_header | A base64-encoded string of the raw LedgerHeader xdr struct for this ledger | bytes |  |  |  |  | No |  |
| successful_transaction_count | The number of successful transactions submitted and completed by the network in this ledger | integer |  |  |  |  | No |  |
| failed_transaction_count | The number of failed transactions submitted to the network in this ledger. The transaction was still paid for but contained an error that prevented it from executing | integer |  |  |  |  | No |  |
| tx_set_operation_count | The total number of operations in the transaction set for this ledger, including failed transactions. | integer |  |  |  |  | No | Transactions on Stellar are atomic. If one of the operations within a transaction set fails, the entire transaction will failed, including any other operations. |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  |  |  |  | Yes | The table is partitioned on batch_run_date. It is recommended to always include the batch_run_date in the filter if possible to help reduce query cost. |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  |  |  |  | Yes |  |
| soroban_fee_write_1kb | Soroban write fee costs | integer |  |  |  |  |  |  |
