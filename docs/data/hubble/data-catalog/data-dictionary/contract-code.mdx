## Column Details

| Name | Description | Data Type | Domain Values | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| contract_code_hash | Soroban contract code hash | string |  | Yes |  |
| contract_code_ext_v | Contract code extension version | integer |  |  |  |
| last_modified_ledger | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry (this unique signer for the account) was modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number | integer |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_entry_change | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry. | integer |  | Yes |  |
| deleted | Indicates whether the ledger entry (balance id) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered. | boolean |  | Yes |  |
| batch_id | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled\_\_\<batch_end_date>-\<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities | string |  | Yes |  |
| batch_run_date | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. | datetime |  | Yes |  |
| batch_insert_ts | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| closed_at | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds | timestamp |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_sequence | The sequence number of this ledger. It represents the order of the ledger within the Stellar blockchain. Each ledger has a unique sequence number that increments with every new ledger, ensuring that ledgers are processed in the correct order. | integer |  | Yes |  |
| ledger_key_hash | Ledger key hash used to identify expiring contract data or contract code ledger entries | string |  | Yes |  |
| n_instructions | Number of instructions in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_functions | Number of functions in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_globals | Number of global variables in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_table_entries | Number of table entries in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_types | Number of types in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_data_segments | Number of data segments in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_elem_segments | Number of element segments in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_imports | Number of imports in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_exports | Number of exports in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
| n_data_segment_bytes | Number of data segment bytes in contract code | integer |  |  |  |
