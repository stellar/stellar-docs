## Ecosystem Data Analytics Platforms

The following is a list of data analytics platforms that make a complete historical record of Pubnet Stellar network data available.

| Platform | Description | Home page and Signup | Pricing | Data Access | Dashboard access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hubble | SDF provides a publicly available raw dataset with a complete historical record of Stellar network data, updated every 15 minutes. | [Hubble](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=crypto-stellar&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scrypto-stellar!2scrypto_stellar) <br></br> [Signup](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en) | End users incur the cost to execute queries. Visit the [BigQuery Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#analysis_pricing_models) page to learn more. | Please see the [Analyst Guide](./analyst-guide) for more information. | N/A |
