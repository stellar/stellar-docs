BigQuery offers multiple connection methods to Hubble. This guide details three common methods:

- [BigQuery UI](#bigquery-ui) - analysts that need to perform ad hoc analysis using SQL
- [BigQuery SDK](#bigquery-sdk) - developers that need to integrate data into applications
- [Looker Studio](#looker-studio) - business people that need to visualize data

## Prerequisites

To access Hubble, you will need a Google Cloud Project with billing and the BigQuery API enabled. For more information, please follow the instructions provided by [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/query-public-dataset-console).

Google does provide a BigQuery Sandbox for free that allows users to explore datasets in a limited capacity.

## BigQuery UI

1. From a browser, open the [crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar](http://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scrypto-stellar!2scrypto_stellar) dataset.
2. This will open the public dataset `crypto_stellar`, where you can browse its contents in the **Explorer** pane.
3. Click the **star** icon in the Explorer pane. This will favorite the dataset for you. More detailed information about starring resources can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui#star_resources).

:::note

Hubble cannot be found from the Explorer pane! You cannot search for the dataset. To view the dataset, you **must** use the [dataset link](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scrypto-stellar!2scrypto_stellar).

:::

Copy and paste the following example query in the Editor:

<CodeExample>

```sql
select
  account_id,
  balance
from `crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar.accounts_current`
order by balance desc;
```

</CodeExample>

This query will return the XLM balances for all Stellar wallet addresses, ordered from largest to smallest amounts.

## BigQuery SDK

There are multiple [BigQuery API Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries) available.

The following example uses Python to access the Hubble dataset. Use [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/setup) for help setting up a python development environment.

Install the client library locally, and configure your environment to use your Google Cloud Project:

<CodeExample>

```bash
# verify python version
python3 --version
# if you do not have pip, install it
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# install bigquery client library
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

</CodeExample>

Use the Python Interpreter to run the example below to list the tables available in Hubble:

<CodeExample>

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.
client = bigquery.Client()

dataset_id = 'crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar'

# Make an API request
tables = client.list_tables(dataset_id)

# List the tables found in Hubble
print(f'Tables contained in {dataset_id}':)
for table in tables:
    print(f'{table.project}.{table.dataset_id}.{table.table_id}')
```

</CodeExample>

Run the example below to run a query and print the results:

<CodeExample>

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.
client = bigquery.Client()

query = """
SELECT
 account_id,
 balance,
FROM `crypto-stellar.crypto_stellar.accounts_current`
ORDER BY balance DESC
LIMIT 10;
"""

# Make an API request
query_job = client.query(query)

print("The query data:")
for row in query_job:
    # Row values can be accessed by field name or index.
    print(f'account_id={row[0]}, balance={row["balance"]}')
```

</CodeExample>

There are various ways to extract and load data using BigQuery. See the [BigQuery Client Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client) for more information.

## Looker Studio

[Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio) is a business intelligence tool that can be used to connect to and visualize data from the Hubble dataset.

To connect Hubble as a data source:

1. Open [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/)
2. Click on **Create** > **Data Source**
3. Search for the BigQuery connector
4. _(Optional)_ Change the name of the data source at the top of the webpage
5. Click _Shared Projects_ > Select your Google Cloud Project
6. Enter `crypto-stellar` as the Shared Project name
7. Click on the Dataset `crypto_stellar`
8. Select the desired table to connect
9. Click `CONNECT` on the top right of the webpage.

And you're connected!

General information about Looker Studio can be found [here](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/).
