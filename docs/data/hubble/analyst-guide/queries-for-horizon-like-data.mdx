title: "Queries for Horizon/RPC-like Data"
sidebar_position: 50
---

[Horizon](/docs/data/horizon) and [RPC](docs/data/rpc) both provide API endpoints to retrieve data from the Stellar network. The following example queries try to retrieve the same data by using Hubble with the added benefit of being able to return historical data.

## Accounts

[horizon/accounts](/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/resources/accounts)

Users interact with the Stellar network through accounts. Everything else in the ledger—assets, offers, trustlines, etc.—are owned by accounts, and accounts must authorize all changes to the ledger through signed transactions.

Learn more about [accounts](../../../learn/glossary.mdx#account).

## Assets

[horizon/assets](/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/resources/assets)

Assets are representations of value issued on the Stellar network. An asset consists of a type, code, and issuer.

  and balance != ""
```

## Claimable Balances

[horizon/claimable_balances](/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/resources/claimablebalances)

A Claimable Balance represents the transfer of ownership of some amount of an asset. Claimable balances provide a mechanism for setting up a payment which can be claimed in the future. This allows you to make payments to accounts which are currently not able to accept them.

## Ledgers

[horizon/ledgers](/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/resources/ledgers)

```

## Trades

[horizon/trades](/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/resources/trades)

When an offer is fully or partially fulfilled, a trade happens. Trades can also be caused by successful path payments, because path payments involve fulfilling offers.

A trade occurs between two parties—`base` and `counter`. Which is which is either arbitrary or determined by the calling query.

Learn more about [trades](/docs/learn/glossary/#decentralized-exchange).

## Trade Aggregations

[horizon/trade_aggregations](/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/aggregations/trade-aggregations)

A trade aggregation represents aggregated statistics on an asset pair (base and counter) for a specific time period. Trade aggregations are useful to developers of trading clients and provide historical trade data.

Hubble does not have as granular trade aggregations as Horizon. Data is available for a given date where trade aggregation information can be provided at the daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly level.

  and day_agg between <start> and <end>
```

## Fee Stats
