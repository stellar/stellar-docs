## Architecture Overview

<img src={stellar_etl_airflow_arch} width="300"/>

In general stellar-etl-airflow runs by:

* Scheduling DAGs to run `stellar-etl` and upload the data outputted to BigQuery
* Scheduling DAGs to run `stellar-dbt-public` using the data in BigQuery
  * We try to adhere to the best practices set by the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects)
