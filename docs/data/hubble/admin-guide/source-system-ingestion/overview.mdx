Stellar network data ingestion in Hubble is done through [stellar-etl](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl/tree/master). stellar-etl reads and transforms Stellar network data into OLAP friendly JSON files.

It is worth noting that most users will not need to standup and run their own stellar-etl instance. The Stellar Development Foundation provides public access to fully transformed Stellar network data through the public datasets and tables in GCP BigQuery. Instructions on how to access this data can be found in the [Connecting](https://developers.stellar.org/network/hubble/analyst-guide/connecting) section.

## Why Run stellar-etl?

Running stellar-etl within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can:

- Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation for network data
- Run modified ETL/ELT pipelines that fit your individual business needs
