Data curation in Hubble is done through [stellar-dbt-public](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dbt-public). stellar-dbt-public transforms raw Stellar network data from BigQuery datasets and tables into aggregates for more user friendly analytics.

It is worth noting that most users will not need to standup and run their own stellar-dbt-public instance. The Stellar Development Foundation provides public access to fully transformed Stellar network data through the public datasets and tables in GCP BigQuery. Instructions on how to access this data can be found in the [Connecting](https://developers.stellar.org/network/hubble/analyst-guide/connecting) section.

## Why Run stellar-dbt-public?

Running stellar-dbt-public within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can:

- Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation for network data
- Run modified ETL/ELT pipelines that fit your individual business needs
