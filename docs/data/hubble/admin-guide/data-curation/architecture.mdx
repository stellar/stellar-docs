## Architecture Overview

<img src={stellar_dbt_arch} width="300" />

In general stellar-dbt-public runs by:

- Selecting a dbt model to run
- Within the model run:
  - Sources are referenced and used to create staging tables
  - Staging tables then undergo various transformations and are stored in intermediate tables
  - Finishing touches and joins are done on the intermediate tables which produce the final analytics friendly mart tables

We try to adhere to the best practices set by the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects)

More detailed information about stellar-dbt-public and examples can be found in the [stellar-dbt-public](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dbt-public/tree/master) repo.
