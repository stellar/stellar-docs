Horizon rate limits on a per-IP-address basis. It can be configured via the option `PER_HOUR_RATE_LIMIT` and defaults to 3600 requests per hour. It is recommended that operators of Horizon tune this value based on their individual infrastructural capabilities and usage needs.

This limit can be disabled entirely by setting the parameter to `0`. 

When a client exceeds this limit, Horizon will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

While streaming, each update of the stream counts as a request and against a clientâ€™s allotted rate limit.
