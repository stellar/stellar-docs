## Ecosystem Horizon Providers

:::info

Starting on August 1, 2024, SDF will be truncating historical data on SDF-owned Horizon to one year. This update allows us to optimize performance and ensure a streamlined experience for all users. We encourage you to explore third-party ecosystem providers of Horizon, which may provide a longer history retention window as well as other features.

:::

Multiple infrastructure providers have made Horizon services available, and offer plans ranging from free to high throughput endpoints. These providers can be used for development, testing, and production.

These providers allow access to the Testnet and Mainnet networks.

| Provider | Access | Futurenet | Testnet | Mainnet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Blockdaemon\*†](https://docs.blockdaemon.com/reference/supported-stellar-methods) | [Access](https://www.blockdaemon.com/apply/soroban) | Not available | Available | Available |
| [QuickNode\*](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/stellar) | [Access](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/stellar) | Not available | Available | Available |
| [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/advanced-api/) | [Access](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/advanced-api/) | Not available | Available | Available |
| [Validation Cloud\*](https://www.validationcloud.io/) | [Access](https://app.validationcloud.io/) | Not available | Available | Available |

\*_Please note that Blockdaemon, Validation Cloud, and Quicknode combine Horizon and RPC in the same endpoint._

†_Please note that Blockdaemon provides full historical data on its Horizon._

## SDF Provided Horizon (Futurenet and Testnet) {#sdf-provided-horizon}

SDF provides a Horizon endpoint but it is rate-limited and subject to changes such as truncation of history. Developers are encouraged to select an ecosystem provider. In some cases, projects may choose to run their own Horizon instance.

| Network | Horizon Endpoint | Friendbot Endpoint | Provider |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Futurenet` | `https://horizon-futurenet.stellar.org` | `https://friendbot-futurenet.stellar.org` | [SDF](http://www.stellar.org) |
| `Testnet` | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://friendbot.stellar.org` | [SDF](http://www.stellar.org) |
