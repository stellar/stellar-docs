There are many ways you can retrieve data from the Stellar network.

## Horizon

Horizon is an API for interacting with the Stellar network.

This API serves the bridge between apps and Stellar Core. Projects like wallets, decentralized exchanges, and asset issuers use Horizon to submit transactions, query an account balance, or stream events like transactions to an account.

## Hubble

Hubble is your go-to source for viewing, analyzing, and understanding historic data from the Stellar network.

## RPC

If you are writing or interacting with smart contracts, you'll need to use RPC. This is the best platform to see current state of the Stellar network.
