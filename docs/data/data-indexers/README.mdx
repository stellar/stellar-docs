## Data Indexers

Data indexers are specialized tools that process and index blockchain data, making it more accessible and queryable to end users. They transform raw blockchain data into a more structured format that’s easier for end users to interact with.

Data indexers have advanced querying capabilities and enhanced analytics. They provide features such as statistical analysis of blockchain activity, visualization of transaction flows, or tracking DeFi metrics — capabilities that go beyond basic transaction lookup for current or historical state data.

Data indexers are a potentially more user-friendly, cost-effective choice for users.
