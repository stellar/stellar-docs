## Ecosystem Providers

Multiple infrastructure providers have made Soroban RPC endpoint services available, and offer plans ranging from free to high throughput endpoints. These providers can be used for development, testing, and production.

These providers allow access to the Testnet and Mainnet networks.

## SDF Provided RPC (Futurenet and Testnet only) {#sdf-provided-rpc}

SDF has made available Soroban RPC with access to the Futurenet and Testnet networks. These services are free to use, and are suitable for development and testing.

SDF will not be providing a publicly available RPC endpoint for Mainnet. Developers should select an ecosystem provider that works for their project before migrating to Mainnet. In some cases, projects may choose to [run their own RPC instance](./admin-guide.mdx).

| Network | RPC Endpoint | Friendbot Endpoint | Provider |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Futurenet` | `https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org` | `https://friendbot-futurenet.stellar.org` | [SDF](http://www.stellar.org) |
| `Testnet` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://friendbot.stellar.org` | [SDF](http://www.stellar.org) |
