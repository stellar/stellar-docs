The RPC service can be installed on bare metal or a virtual machine. It is natively supported on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

### Hardware Requirements

For deployments expecting up to 1000 requests per second to Stellar RPC, we recommend at least 4GB of RAM and at least a dual core CPU with a 2.4GHz clock speed.

For deployments expecting 1000-10000+ requests per second to Stellar RPC, we recommend at least 8GB of RAM and at least a quad core CPU with a 2.4GHz clock speed.

For all deployments, we recommend at least 10GB of disk/storage space.

| Node Type | CPU | RAM | Disk | AWS SKU | Google Cloud SKU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stellar RPC | 2 vCPU | 4-8 GB | 30 GB persistent volume >= 3K IOPS | [c5.large] | [n4-highcpu-2] |

_\* Assuming a 7-day retention window for data storage._

We highly recommend using a local SSD disk for storage. RPC is compatible with network-based filesystems like AWS EBS but it will negatively impact its performance.
