Stellar RPC is a lightweight service that provides real-time access to Stellar network data. Much like RPC nodes in other blockchain ecosystems, it allows developers to query the network efficiently.

The RPC service allows you to communicate directly with a Stellar network via a [JSON RPC interface](../README.mdx).

For example, you can build an application and have it [send a transaction](../api-reference/methods/getTransaction.mdx), [get ledger](../api-reference/methods/getLedgerEntries.mdx) and [event data](../api-reference/methods/getEvents.mdx), or [simulate transactions](../api-reference/methods/simulateTransaction.mdx).

Alternatively, you can use one of Soroban's [client SDKs](/docs/tools/sdks/client-sdks), such as the [@stellar/stellar-sdk](/docs/tools/sdks/client-sdks#javascript-sdk), which will need to communicate with an RPC instance to access the network.
