If you run Stellar RPC with the `--admin-endpoint` configured and [expose the port](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish), you'll have access to the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint. For example, if the admin endpoint is `0.0.0.0:8001` and you're running the Stellar RPC Docker image:

```bash
curl localhost:8001/metrics
```

You will see many of the default Go and Process metrics (prefixed by `go_` and `process_` respectively) such as memory usage, CPU usage, number of threads, etc.

We also expose metrics related to Stellar RPC (prefixed by `soroban_rpc`). There are many, but some notable ones are:

- `soroban_rpc_transactions_count` - count of transactions ingested with a sliding window of 10m
- `soroban_rpc_events_count` - count of events ingested with a sliding window of 10m
- `soroban_rpc_ingest_local_latest_ledger` - latest ledger ingested
- `soroban_rpc_db_round_trip_time_seconds` - time required to run `SELECT 1` query in the DATABASE

Stellar RPC also provides logging to console for:

- Startup activity
- Ingesting, applying, and closing ledgers
- Handling JSON RPC requests
- Any errors

The logs have the format:

```
time=<timestamp in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.000Z format> level=<debug|info|error> msg=<Actual message> pid=<process ID> subservice=<optional if coming from subservice>
```
