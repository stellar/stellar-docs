Stellar-RPC will accept HTTP POST requests using the [JSON-RPC 2.0] specification. Errors are returned via the [jsonrpc error object] wherever possible (and makes sense).

For production and other publicly-accessible instances, the JSON-RPC endpoint should be served over SSL on port 443, where possible, for security and ease of use. Though, stellar-rpc does not terminate ssl by itself, so will need a load-balancer or other service to terminate SSL for it.

To interact with stellar-rpc from inside a JavaScript application, use the [JavaScript SDK] package, which gives a convenient interface for the RPC methods inside of its `SorobanRpc` module.

When XDR is passed as a parameter or returned, it is always a string encoded using standard base64.

:::info

Please note that parameter structure must contain named parameters as a by-name object, and not as positional arguments as a by-position array. Positional arguments as a by-position array will be deprecated in future RPC releases.

## Open-RPC Specification

Stellar-RPC provides an [OpenRPC] specification document that can be used to mock, build, and/or validate both server and client software implementations. This document is used to generate all of our [methods] documentation pages. You can view the full [specification document here]. Additionally, you can experiment with this specificaiton document in the [OpenRPC Playground].
