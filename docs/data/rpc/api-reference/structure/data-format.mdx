### XDR Format

In the Stellar network, transactions are encoded using a standardized protocol called [External Data Representation](/docs/learn/encyclopedia/data-format/xdr) (XDR).

In RPC, you will encounter XDR when [simulating](../methods/simulateTransaction) and [sending](../methods/sendTransaction) transactions, as well as when retrieving [transactions](../methods/getTransactions), [ledgers](../methods/getLedgers), and [ledger entries](../methods/getLedgerEntries).

By default, RPC will return all XDR attributes as the machine-readable base64 encoded XDR string. XDR-encoded response fields are usually suffixed with `Xdr`. You can decode this XDR in the Stellar Labâ€™s [XDR page](https://lab.stellar.org/xdr/view?$=network$id=testnet&label=Testnet&horizonUrl=https:////horizon-testnet.stellar.org&rpcUrl=https:////soroban-testnet.stellar.org&passphrase=Test%20SDF%20Network%20/;%20September%202015;;).

### JSON Format

All RPC endpoints which return encoded XDR fields accept the `xdrFormat` attribute. This allows a client to change the response format to JSON, ultimately making it more human-readable. Note that you should not rely on any schema for the JSON, as it will change when the underlying XDR changes.

In the event that a `json` output format is requested, response fields suffixed with `Xdr` will be omitted and replaced with their `Json` suffixed counterparts.
