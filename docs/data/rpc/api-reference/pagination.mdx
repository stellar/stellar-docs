title: Pagination

Pagination in stellar-rpc is similar to pagination in Horizon.

For methods which support it, the pagination arguments are passed as a final object argument with two values:

- `cursor`: string - (optional) A string ID that points to a specific location in a collection of responses and is pulled from the paging*token value of a record. When a cursor is provided Stellar-RPC will \_not* include the element whose id matches the cursor in the response. Only elements which appear _after_ the cursor are included.
- `limit`: number - (optional) The maximum number of records returned. The limit for [getEvents](./methods/getEvents.mdx) can range from 1 to 10000 - an upper limit that is hardcoded in Stellar-RPC for performance reasons. If this argument isn't designated, it defaults to 100.

For example, calling a method with pagination parameter set:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1",
  "method": "exampleMethod",
  "params": {
    "some": "argument",
    "pagination": {
      "cursor": "1234-1",
      "limit": 100
    }
  }
}
```
