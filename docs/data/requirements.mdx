title: Node Hardware Requirements
---

Here you can find the requirements for running the various types of nodes the operate the Stellar network. We offer some modest recommendations for each type of resource, as well as a generally applicable SKU for some popular cloud computing providers. These may require customizations or adjustments, depending on your specific use-case.

| Node Type | CPU | RAM | Disk | AWS SKU | Google Cloud SKU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Validator Node | 8x Intel Xeon @ 3.4 GHz | 16 GB | 100 GB NVMe SSD | [c5d.2xlarge] | [n4-highcpu-8] |
| Horizon API Service | 4 vCPU | 16 GB | 100 GB SSD >= 1.5K IOPS | [c5d.xlarge] |[n4-standard-4] |
| Horizon PostgreSQL | 4 vCPU | 32 GB | 2 TB\* SSD (NVMe or Direct Attached Storage) >= 7K IOPS | [i4g.xlarge] | [c3-highmem-8] |
| Soroban RPC | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 30 GB persistent volume >= 3K IOPS | [c5.large] | [n4-highcpu-2] |

_\* Assuming a 30-day retention window for data storage._
