Here you can find the requirements for running the various types of nodes the operate the Stellar network. We offer some modest recommendations for each type of resource, as well as a generally applicable SKU for some popular cloud computing providers. These may require customizations or adjustments, depending on your specific use-case.

| Node Type | CPU | RAM | Disk | AWS SKU | Google Cloud SKU | Admin Guide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Validator Node | 8x Intel Xeon @ 3.4 GHz | 16 GB | 100 GB NVMe SSD | [c5d.2xlarge] | [n4-highcpu-8] | [Click here](../validators/admin-guide/README.mdx) |
| Horizon API Service | 4 vCPU | 16 GB | 100 GB SSD >= 1.5K IOPS | [c5d.xlarge] | [n4-standard-4] | [Click here](./horizon/admin-guide/overview.mdx) |
| Horizon PostgreSQL | 4 vCPU | 32 GB | 2 TB\* SSD (NVMe or Direct Attached Storage) >= 7K IOPS | [i4g.xlarge] | [c3-highmem-8] | [Click here](./horizon/admin-guide/overview.mdx) |
| Soroban RPC | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 30 GB persistent volume >= 3K IOPS | [c5.large] | [n4-highcpu-2] | [Click here](./rpc/admin-guide.mdx) |
