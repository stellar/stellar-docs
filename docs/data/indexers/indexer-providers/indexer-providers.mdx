## Data Indexers

To power your applications, a range of data services will be available from data indexers with query interfaces. These indexers will allow you to easily store and retrieve decoded ledger data, contract event emissions, and more. You can focus more energy on making your project successful, and waste less time figuring out precisely how to get the important data from the network.
