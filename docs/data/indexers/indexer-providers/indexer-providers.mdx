## Data Indexers

To power your applications, a range of data services will be available from data indexers with query interfaces. These indexers will allow you to easily store and retrieve decoded ledger data, contract event emissions, and more. You can focus more energy on making your project successful, and waste less time figuring out precisely how to get the important data from the network.

### [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/)

A data pipeline tool allowing you to combine on-chain and off-chain data however you like, streamed directly into your own custom database.

### [Mercury](https://docs.mercurydata.app)

A network indexing service that provides a toolkit to help get you started working with Stellar network data.

### [SubQuery](https://subquery.network/)

An open-source data indexer for Stellar that enables custom API creation for dapps and smart contracts with clean, indexed data. It supports indexing ledgers, transactions, operations, and effects from Stellar, as well as transactions and events from Soroban into a Postgres database.

### [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)

A decentralized indexing protocol for querying blockchain data. The Graph allows developers to build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that make on-chain data easily accessible and searchable for their applications.
