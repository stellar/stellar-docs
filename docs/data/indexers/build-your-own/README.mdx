If none of the indexing providers mentioned [in the overview](../README.mdx) meet your needs, you can also build your own. Start with this [tutorial on how to build your own custom network ingestion pipeline](../../../build/apps/ingest-sdk/overview.mdx). Along the way, you'll use the following tools & services:

## [Galexie](./galexie/README.mdx)

Galexie is a tool for acquiring Stellar ledger metadata from the network and exporting to external storage,a data lake. Galexie is the foundation of the Composable Data Pipeline (CDP) and serves as the first step in extracting raw Stellar ledger metadata and making it accessible. Learn more about CDP’s benefits and applications in [this blog post](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/composable-data-platform).

**Why Use It:**

- You want to maintain a data lake of pre-computed ledger metadata for historical and currently closed network ledgers.

## [Ingest SDK](./ingest-sdk/README.mdx)

A set of Golang packages which can be used within application as a programmatic domain model to interact with Stellar network.

**Why Use It:**

- You want rapid development of applications in Golang which can acquire and parse ledger meta data and ledger entries from Stellar network.
- You want an intuitive, compile-time, type-safe application developer experience.
- You want to programmatically access History Archives to retrieve ledger entries.

## [Processors](./processors/README.mdx)

A suite of Go packages that help you parse Stellar blockchain data.
