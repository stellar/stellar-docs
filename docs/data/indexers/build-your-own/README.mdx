## [Galexie](./galexie/README.mdx)

Galexie is a tool for extracting, processing, exporting Stellar ledger metadata to external storage, and creating a data lake of pre-processed ledger metadata. Galexie is the foundation of the Composable Data Pipeline (CDP) and serves as the first step in extracting raw Stellar ledger metadata and making it accessible. Learn more about CDP’s benefits and applications in [this blog post](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/composable-data-platform).
