This section showcases real-world use cases of the Ingest SDK, focusing on key components like `ingest.LedgerTransaction`, `ingest.LedgerChange`, `ingest.LedgerTransactionReader`, and `ingest.ChangeReader`.

These examples take a Stellar Ledger (`xdr.LedgerCloseMeta`) or a ledger sequence range (start-end) as input. Each of the examples listed here is complete, and can be compiled and run as-is in your IDE/local dev.

## Prerequisites

Some of the examples listed here might invoke the `stellar-core` binary. Refer to the "admin guide" for more details on how to compile `stellar-core` for your platform.

The Ingest SDK is currently a part of the [Stellar Go Repo](https://github.com/stellar/go), which includes several packages in addition to the ingest SDK. You will need to include the following in the `go.mod` file in your codebase.

```
//filename: go.mod

require (
    github.com/stellar/go v0.0.0-20250206032706-4e70599a66af
)

```

You may want to optionally run `go mod tidy` in your codebase to pull the latest version of the ingest package.
