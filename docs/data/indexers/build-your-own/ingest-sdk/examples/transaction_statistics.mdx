title: Get successful/failed transactions from a ledger range
sidebar_position: 10
---

This example illustrates how to run and connect with a Stellar network watcher node, referred to as 'captive core' using the `ledgerbackend.CaptiveStellarCore`. It then requests a historical bounded range of ledgers to be replayed. The captive core instance will emit a stream of ledger metadata (`xdr.LedgerCloseMeta`) which contains the transactions per ledger in the range. It reads each ledger's transactions using the `ingest.LedgerTransactionReader`, categorizes them as successful or failed, and tracks the operations associated with each transaction.

		// accumulate the statistics we're interested in.

			panicIf(err)

			envelope := tx.Envelope
			operationCount := len(envelope.Operations())

	fmt.Println("\nDone. Results:")
	fmt.Printf("  - total transactions: %d\n", successfulTransactions+failedTransactions)

```

**Sample Response:**

```bash
>> go run ./transaction_statistics.go
Preparing range (10000 ledgers)...
Processed ledger 7010000...
Done. Results:
  - total transactions: 108
  - succeeded / failed: 107 / 1
  - total operations:   175
  - succeeded / failed: 174 / 1
```
