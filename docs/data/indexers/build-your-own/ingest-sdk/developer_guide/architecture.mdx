## Ingest SDK Structure

Ingest SDK is organized into three main components:

1. **[Ledger Backends](./ledgerbackends/README.mdx)**: Used to stream ledgers from the Stellar network. `https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/tree/main/ingest/ledgerbackend`
2. **[Ledger Readers](./ledgerreaders.mdx)** : Iterators to extract individual changes or transactions from a ledger. `https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/tree/main/ingest`
3. **[Ledger Processors](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/tree/main/ingest/processors)** : Functions to process individual changes or transactions and extract meaningful data such as accounts, offers, claimable balance, etc. They are used in conjunction with `Ledger Readers` to interpret and transform ledger data.
