These readers are designed to extract data from the Stellar ledger in a structured way and enables iterating over ledger changes.

- [LedgerTransactionReader](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledger_transaction_reader.go): Extracts transactions from a specific ledger sequence. It retrieves the transaction set from `LedgerCloseMeta` and provides an iterator for accessing each individual transaction.

- [LedgerChangeReader](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledger_change_reader.go): Provides a complete record of all ledger entry changes within a ledger, including those from transactions, fees, upgrades, and other network-level operations. It processes `LedgerCloseMeta` to extract `LedgerEntryChanges`.

- [CheckpointChangeReader](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/checkpoint_change_reader.go): Reads ledger entries from history archive buckets at a checkpoint ledger, enabling developers to reconstruct the state (accounts, trust lines etc.) at a specific point in time.
