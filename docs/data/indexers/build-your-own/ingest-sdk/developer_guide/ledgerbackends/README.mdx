A ledger backend is a source of Stellar network ledger data. The ingest SDK supports two primary ledger backends, both implementing the [ledgerbackend](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/ingest/ledgerbackend/ledger_backend.go) interface. This interface always returns ledger data as [LedgerCloseMeta](/docs/data/indexers/build-your-own/ingest-sdk/developer_guide/ledgerbackends#ledgerclosemeta-structure), which is XDR-encoded ledger metadata object.

1. **[Captive Core](/docs/data/indexers/build-your-own/ingest-sdk/developer_guide/ledgerbackends/captivecore)** – Invokes the `stellar-core` binary as a subprocess which connects to the live Stellar network and fetches network data (i.e., ledgers).
2. **[BufferedStorageBackend](/docs/data/indexers/build-your-own/ingest-sdk/developer_guide/ledgerbackends/bufferedstoragebackend)** – Retrieves ledger metadata from cloud storage.
3. **[RPCLedgetBackend](/docs/data/indexers/build-your-own/ingest-sdk/developer_guide/ledgerbackends/rpcledgerbackend)** – Retrieves ledger metadata from an RPC server.

Each backend has its own setup and configuration requirements, which are covered in the following sections.

### LedgerCloseMeta Structure

`xdr.LedgerCloseMeta` captures a detailed record of all state changes during the closing of a Stellar ledger. It includes:

- `LedgerHeader` – Metadata about the ledger, including:

  - Ledger sequence number
  - Previous ledger hash
  - Close time
  - Bucketlist hash

- `TxSet` – The set of transactions included in the ledger.

- `TxProcessing` – Execution results of each transaction, including:

  - Success or failure of operations within transactions
  - `OperationMeta`, which tracks `LedgerEntryChanges` caused by transactions

- `UpgradesProcessing` – Any protocol upgrades applied in this ledger.

- `ScpInfo` – Details of the consensus process that finalized this ledger.

- `EvictedLedgerKeys` – Keys of ledger entries removed due to expiration.
