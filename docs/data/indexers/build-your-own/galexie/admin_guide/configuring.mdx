# Configuring

## Steps to Configure Galexie

### 1. Copy the Sample Configuration

Start with the provided sample file, [`config.example.toml`](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/galexie/config.example.toml).

### 2. Rename and Update the Configuration

Rename the file to `config.toml` and adjust settings as needed.

#### Key Settings Include

##### Cloud Storage Service

Specify the cloud storage service to be used to export ledger metadata. Currently only `GCS` and `S3` are supported

```toml
type = "GCS"
```

##### Cloud Storage Bucket

Specify the cloud storage bucket where Galexie will export Stellar ledger data. Update `destination_bucket_path` to the complete path of your bucket, including subpaths if applicable.

```toml
destination_bucket_path = "stellar-network-data/testnet"
```

##### Stellar Network

Set the Stellar network to be used in creating the data lake.

```toml
network = "testnet"
```

##### Data Organization (Optional)

Configure how the exported data is organized in the storage bucket. The example below adds 1 ledger per file and organizes them in a directory of 64000 files.

```toml
# Number of ledgers stored in each file
ledgers_per_file = 1

# Number of files per partition/directory
files_per_partition = 64000
```
