# Configuring

## Steps to Configure Galexie

1. **Copy the Sample Configuration**

   Start with the provided sample file, [`config.example.toml`](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/galexie/config.example.toml).

2. **Rename and Update the Configuration**

   Rename the file to `config.toml` and adjust settings as needed.
   - **Key Settings Include:**
     - **Cloud Storage Service**

       Specify the cloud storage service to be used to export ledger metadata. Currently only `GCS` and `S3` are supported

       ```toml
       type = "GCS"
       ```

     - **Cloud Storage Bucket**

       Specify the cloud storage bucket where Galexie will export Stellar ledger data. Update `destination_bucket_path` to the complete path of your bucket, including subpaths if applicable.

       ```toml
       destination_bucket_path = "stellar-network-data/testnet"
       ```

     - **Stellar Network**

       Set the Stellar network to be used in creating the data lake.

       ```toml
       network = "testnet"
       ```

     - **Data Organization (Optional)**

       Configure how the exported data is organized in the storage bucket. The example below adds 1 ledger per file and organizes them in a directory of 64000 files.

       ```toml
        # Number of ledgers stored in each file
        ledgers_per_file = 1

        # Number of files per partition/directory
        files_per_partition = 64000
       ```
