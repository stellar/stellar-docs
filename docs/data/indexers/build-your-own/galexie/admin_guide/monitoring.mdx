# Monitoring

### Metrics

Galexie publishes metrics through an HTTP-based admin endpoint, which makes it easier to monitor its performance. This endpoint is configurable in the `config.toml` file, where you can specify the port on which metrics are made available. The data is exposed in Prometheus format, enabling easy integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems.

The admin port can be configured in the `config.toml` file by setting the `admin_port` variable. By default, the `admin_port` is set to `6061`

```toml
# Admin port configuration
# Specifies the port for hosting the HTTP service that publishes metrics.
admin_port = 6061
```

With this configuration, the URL to access the metrics endpoint will be:

```
http://<host>:6061/metrics
```

Galexie emits several application-specific metrics to help track the export process:

- `galexie_last_exported_ledger`: The sequence number of the most recently exported ledger.
- `galexie_uploader_put_duration_seconds`: The time taken to upload objects to the data lake.
- `galexie_uploader_object_size_bytes`: Compressed and uncompressed sizes of the objects being uploaded.
- `galexie_upload_queue_length`: Number of objects currently queued and waiting to be uploaded.

In addition to these application-specific metrics, Galexie also exports system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, open file descriptors) and Stellar Core ingestion metrics such as `galexie_ingest_ledger_fetch_duration_seconds`

Use these metrics to build queries that monitor Galexieâ€™s performance and export process. Here are a few examples of useful queries:

- Export Times: Query `galexie_uploader_put_duration_seconds` to monitor average upload times.
- Queue Length: Use `galexie_upload_queue_length` to view the number of objects waiting to be uploaded.
- Latest Exported Ledger: Track `galexie_last_exported_ledger` to ensure that ledger exports are up-to-date.

For a quick start, download our pre-built Grafana dashboard for Galexie [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/22285-stellar-galexie/). This dashboard provides pre-configured queries and visualizations to help you monitor Galexie's health. You can customize it to fit your specific needs.

### Logging

Galexie emits logs to stdout and generates a log line for every object being exported to help monitor progress.

Example logs:

```
