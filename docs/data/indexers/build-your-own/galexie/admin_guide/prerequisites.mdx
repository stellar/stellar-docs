# Prerequisites

### 1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account

Galexie exports Stellar ledger metadata to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), so you need a GCP account with:

- Permissions to create a new GCS bucket, or
- Access to an existing bucket with read/write permissions.

### 2. Docker (Recommended)

> **_NOTE:_** While it is possible to natively install Galexie (without Docker), this requires manual dependency management and is recommended only for advanced users.]

Galexie is available as a Docker image, which simplifies installation and setup. Ensure you have Docker Engine installed on your system ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).

## Hardware Requirements

The minimum hardware requirements for running Galexie are:\
**RAM**: 8 GB\
**CPU**: 2 vCPUs\
**Disk**: 100 GB with at least 5K IOPS

### Full History Export

Exporting the full history (as of November 2024):

- Takes an estimated 150 days using a single instance of Galexie
- Creates a data lake of approximately 3 TB
- To speed up the export, multiple instances of Galexie can be executed in parallel, each working on a different range
- For example, creating the full history for Hubble data lake using about 40 parallel instances (each exporting approximately 1.25 million ledgers) on _e2-standard-2_ (Google Cloud Platform) takes about 5 days
