# Setup

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials

Create application default credentials by using your user account for your GCP project by following these steps:

1. Download the [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. Install and initialize the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing).
3. Create [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#google-idp) and it should automatically store in this location: `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json.`
4. Verify that this file exists before moving on to the next step.

### Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket

If you already have a GCS bucket with read and write permissions, you can skip this section. If not, follow these steps:

1. Visit the GCP Console's Storage section (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) and create a new bucket.
2. Choose a descriptive name for the bucket, such as `stellar-ledger-data`. Refer to [Google Cloud Storage Bucket Naming Guideline](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/buckets#naming) for bucket naming conventions. Note down the bucket name, you will need it later during the configuration process.
