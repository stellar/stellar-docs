## [Build Your Own Indexer](./build-your-own/README.mdx)

Building your own indexer with tools like Galexie allows you to export Stellar ledger metadata to external storage for custom data processing and analysis. This enables greater flexibility in structuring and querying blockchain data based on specific use cases.

## [Data Indexer Providers](./indexer-providers/indexer-providers.mdx)

Data indexers process and structure blockchain data, making it more accessible and queryable for users with advanced analytics and visualization capabilities. They offer features like transaction flow analysis and DeFi metric tracking, providing a user-friendly and cost-effective alternative for exploring blockchain activity. Along with analytics, applications can use data indexers to track value movement of assets, track assets within an account, trace suspicious operations, and more.
