# Configuration

To enable SEP-6 deposits and withdraws, the Anchor Platform must be configured to do the following:

- Provide the necessary service URLs for SEP-6, 12, & 38 endpoints in the `stellar.toml` file
- Provide information about the on & off-chain assets, as well as the payment rails, supported by your business via SEP-6 and SEP-38 `/info` endpoints
- Support the endpoints and callbacks required to request KYC information and provide exchange rates

## Enable Programmatic Deposits & Withdrawals

Add the following variables to your environment file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP6_ENABLED=true
SEP12_ENABLED=true
SEP38_ENABLED=true
```

</CodeExample>

### Modify a Stellar Info File

Let's modify the `stellar.toml` file created [earlier][sep1-ap]. Wallets need to know that SEP-6 functionality is supported by your business, and they also need to know all the Stellar assets you support.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

TRANSFER_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep6"
WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"
KYC_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep12"
ANCHOR_QUOTE_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep38"

# Add support for USDC
[[CURRENCIES]]
code = "USDC"
issuer = "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
status = "test"
is_asset_anchored = false
desc = "USD Coin issued by Circle"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>

Note that you will need to create another file for your production deployment that uses the public network's passphrase, your production service URLs, your Mainnet distribution accounts and signing key, as well as the Mainnet issuing accounts of the assets your service utilizes.

### Modify the Assets Configuration File

Now you're ready to specify the following in your `dev.assets.yaml` file, and change the values depending on your use case. This example asset file enables support for Circle's USDC and a fiat USD to deposit from and withdraw to.

The methods specified in the `sep38` sections are methods that will be exposed by the SEP-38 [`GET /info`][sep38] endpoint.

The methods specified in the `deposit` and `withdraw` sections are the methods that will be exposed by the SEP-6 [`GET /info`][sep-6] endpoint. The methods listed should match the methods defined in the SEP-38 section of the file.

Also note that fiat assets, those with the `schema: iso4217`, do not need the `sep6_enabled`, `deposit`, or `withdraw` configuration objects specified. In the same way, Stellar assets, those with `schema: stellar`, do not need the `sep38.sell_delivery_methods` or `sep38.buy_delivery_methods` configuration objects specified.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
items:
  - id: stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
    distribution_account: GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7
    significant_decimals: 2
    sep6:
      enabled: true
      deposit:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - ACH
      withdraw:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - ACH
    sep38:
      enabled: true
      exchangeable_assets:
        - iso4217:USD
  - id: iso4217:USD
    significant_decimals: 2
    sep38:
      enabled: true
      exchangeable_assets:
        - stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
      buy_delivery_methods:
        - name: ACH
          description: ACH debits for US bank accounts
      sell_delivery_methods:
        - name: ACH
          description: ACH credit for US bank accounts
```

</CodeExample>

### Managing Distribution Accounts

Note that the example above lists a `distribution_account` attribute for the USDC entry. If specified, this account will be provided along with a randomly generated and unique-per-transaction memo to clients as the address to send funds to for withdrawal transactions. The transaction's memo is how you or the Anchor Platform will match the funds received with a transaction record in the Anchor Platform's database.

If you do not have your own Stellar account and instead use a third party that provides you a Stellar account and memo so they can receive funds on your behalf, such as an exchange or custodian, you should omit the `distribution_account` field from your assets config file. Instead, you'll need to provide the Stellar account and memo you'd like to use to receive funds through a request to the Anchor Platform's [`request_onchain_funds`][request-onchain-funds] on a per-transaction basis.

To configure the Anchor Platform to expect the Stellar account and memo to be provided via API instead of configured via the assets file, specify the following environment variable.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP6_DEPOSIT_INFO_GENERATOR_TYPE=none
```

</CodeExample>

### Enable Callbacks to the Business Server

Businesses need to collect and validate KYC information on the customers they're facilitating transactions for. Clients ask your business what KYC information needs to be collected and sends that information via the SEP-12 KYC API hosted by the Anchor Platform, but the Anchor Platform never stores personally-identifiable information (PII). Instead, it forwards requests from clients to the business server, and returns the business' responses back to the client, acting as a proxy server.

Additionally, businesses need to provide clients with a [Rates][get-rates-api] API to check the exchange rates they're offering between the onchain and offchain assets supported by the business. If the rate is competitive, clients also need to be able to request a commitment to the rate currently being offered from business for a short period of time. Similarly to the KYC API, the Anchor Platform makes requests to your business server to fetch exchange rates and quotes and returns them to clients.

To enable these requests to your business server, first you'll need to add your business server to the docker compose file. Then, to support requests to your business server from the Anchor Platform, you need to enable callbacks.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
CALLBACK_API_BASE_URL=http://business-server:3000/callbacks
CALLBACK_API_AUTH_TYPE=jwt
CALLBACK_API_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRATION_MILLISECONDS=30000
CALLBACK_API_AUTH_JWT_HTTP_HEADER=Authorization
SECRET_CALLBACK_API_AUTH_SECRET="a secret used to sign JWTs"
```

</CodeExample>

The above tells the Anchor Platform to include a [JWT][how-to-use-jwt], signed with the configured secret, in the `Authorization` header of requests made to `/callbacks/<callback endpoint>` so your server can authenticate the Anchor Platform before processing requests.

See the [KYC API][platform-api-kyc] and [Rates API][get-rates-api] for details on the endpoints that must be implemented on your business server.

### Additional Optional Configuration

`more_info_url` is an optional URL provided by your business server for wallet applications to display information about previously initiated transactions. This URL is typically used by wallets in their transaction history views, and your business can specify the information to be displayed about the transaction.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP6_MORE_INFO_URL_BASE_URL=http://example.com
SECRET_SEP6_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"
```

</CodeExample>

Businesses can set a deadline for user actions on transactions using the `user_action_required_by` field. For examples, see [JSON-RPC Methods][json-rpc-methods]. In addition, the `initial_user_deadline_seconds` parameter sets a default time (in seconds) a user has to act before the transaction moves into the `EXPIRED` status.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP6_INITIAL_USER_DEADLINE_SECONDS=1209600
```

</CodeExample>

## Test With the Demo Wallet

Wallets should now be able to discover, authenticate, and initiate transactions with your service! Your project and source files should now look something like this.

<CodeExample>

```
├── dev.env
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── config
│   ├── dev.assets.yaml
│   ├── dev.stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

Your environment should now look something like the following.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
ASSETS_TYPE=file
ASSETS_VALUE=/home/dev.assets.yaml

SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TOML_TYPE=file
SEP1_TOML_VALUE=/home/dev.stellar.toml

SEP6_ENABLED=true
SEP6_DEPOSIT_INFO_GENERATOR_TYPE=none
SEP6_MORE_INFO_URL_BASE_URL=http://example.com
SECRET_SEP6_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"

SEP10_ENABLED=true
SEP10_HOME_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret used to sign JWTs"

SEP12_ENABLED=true

SEP38_ENABLED=true

CALLBACK_API_BASE_URL=http://business-server:3000/callbacks
CALLBACK_API_AUTH_TYPE=jwt
CALLBACK_API_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRATION_MILLISECONDS=30000
CALLBACK_API_AUTH_JWT_HTTP_HEADER=Authorization
SECRET_CALLBACK_API_AUTH_SECRET="a secret used to sign JWTs"
```

</CodeExample>

To test this out, go to the [Stellar Demo Wallet][stellar-demo-wallet].

Initiate a deposit transaction by doing the following:

- Create a new keypair
- Click the "Add Asset" button and enter
  - the code of the Stellar asset on your `stellar.toml` file
  - your home domain, `localhost:8080`
- Select the dropdown and click "SEP-6 Deposit", then click "Start"

The demo wallet should be able to find your `stellar.toml` file, authenticate using the Stellar keypair you just created, and initiate a transaction.
