This guide will walk you through configuring and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building a cross-border payments recieve-side service compatible with [SEP-31](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0031.md), the ecosystem's standardized protocol for cross-border payments.

By leveraging the Anchor Platform's support for SEP-31, businesses make their service compatible with Stellar's existing set of send-side services.

As we improve the documentation, parts of this guide that are relevant to other use cases may be moved into their own sections.

:::

Before continuing with this section, make sure that you have already [installed](../../admin-guide/getting-started.mdx) the Anchor Platform and configured the necessary features required by SEP-31: [SEP-1 (Stellar Info File)](../sep1/README.mdx), [SEP-10 (Stellar Authentication)](../sep10/README.mdx) and [SEP-45 (Stellar Web Authentication for contract account)](../sep45/README.mdx).
