title: Stellar Info File (SEP-1)
---

## Overview

SEP-1 (Stellar Info File) allows wallets and other Stellar applications to discover information about your anchor service. By hosting a `stellar.toml` file at `/.well-known/stellar.toml`, you enable applications to automatically find:

- Your organization's information
- Supported assets and currencies
- Authentication endpoints (SEP-10)
- SEP endpoints for SEP-6, SEP-24, SEP-31, SEP-38, SEP-45

For details, please refer to the [SEP-1 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md).

## Creating Your stellar.toml File

Create a `stellar.toml` file with your service information. Here's a minimal example to get started:

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["GD...G"]  # Your distribution account public keys
SIGNING_KEY = "GD...G"  # Your signing key (public key) for SEP-10 authentication
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"  # Use "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" for mainnet

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "https://your-website.com"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

For a complete list of all available `stellar.toml` attributes, see the [SEP-1 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md). You'll need to add additional sections like `[[CURRENCIES]]`, `TRANSFER_SERVER`, `TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024`, `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`, `WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT`, `DIRECT_PAYMENT_SERVER` etc., as you configure the supported assets and other SEPs.

:::important

**Production vs. Development**: You'll need separate `stellar.toml` files for testnet and mainnet:

- **Testnet**: Use `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"`
- **Mainnet**: Use `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"`

Make sure your production file includes your actual Mainnet distribution accounts, signing keys, and production service URLs.

## Configuration

To enable SEP-1, you need to configure how the Anchor Platform should access your `stellar.toml` file. The platform supports three methods:

| Type | Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | **Recommended for most cases** | Read from a local file on the server |
| `string` | Quick testing or simple configs | Provide the TOML content directly in the config |
| `url` | External hosting | Fetch from a remote URL (useful for dynamic content) |

### Environment Variables

Configure SEP-1 using the following environment variables:

- `SEP1_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable SEP-1
- `SEP1_TOML_TYPE`: One of `file`, `string`, or `url`
- `SEP1_TOML_VALUE`: The value depends on the type (see examples below)

### Method 1: File (Recommended)

Best for: Production deployments where you manage the file on disk.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TOML_TYPE=file
SEP1_TOML_VALUE=/path/to/your/stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

When using Docker, mount your `stellar.toml` file as a volume and reference the path inside the container. For example:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
volumes:
  - ./config/stellar.toml:/config/stellar.toml:ro
```

Then set `SEP1_TOML_VALUE=/config/stellar.toml` in your environment.

:::

### Method 2: String

Best for: Quick testing, development, or when managing config via environment variables.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TOML_TYPE=string
SEP1_TOML_VALUE="ACCOUNTS = [\"GD...G\"]
SIGNING_KEY = \"GD...G\"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = \"Test SDF Network ; September 2015\"
[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = \"Your organization\"
ORG_URL = \"https://your-website.com\""
```

</CodeExample>

:::caution

When using the `string` type, ensure your TOML content is properly escaped for your environment file format. For complex configurations, the `file` type is easier to manage.

:::

### Method 3: URL

Best for: Dynamic content or when hosting the file externally.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TOML_TYPE=url
SEP1_TOML_VALUE=https://example.com/stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

:::note

When using the `url` type, the Anchor Platform will fetch the file on each request. Make sure the URL is accessible from your Anchor Platform server and returns valid TOML content.

:::

## Accessing Your stellar.toml File

Once configured and enabled, the Anchor Platform automatically serves your `stellar.toml` file at the standard SEP-1 endpoint:

- **`/.well-known/stellar.toml`** - The primary endpoint (served with `Content-Type: text/plain`)
- **`/`** - Redirects to `/.well-known/stellar.toml` when SEP-1 is enabled

### Testing Your Configuration

After starting the Anchor Platform, verify your configuration:

```bash
# Test the endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/stellar.toml

# Or test the redirect
curl -L http://localhost:8080/
```

You should see your `stellar.toml` content returned as plain text.

### Alternative: External Hosting

You can also host your `stellar.toml` file using a static file server like [nginx](https://www.nginx.com) or a CDN. If you choose this approach:

1. Host the file at `https://your-domain.com/.well-known/stellar.toml`
2. Ensure it's publicly accessible
3. Make sure your `stellar.toml` file includes the correct URLs pointing to your Anchor Platform endpoints

The Anchor Platform's SEP-1 service is optional if you're hosting the file externally, but it provides a convenient way to manage everything in one place.
