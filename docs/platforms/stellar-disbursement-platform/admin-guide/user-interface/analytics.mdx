The Analytics page provides comprehensive insights into various aspects of financial transactions, enabling the user to track and understand key payment-related metrics. As more metrics and statistics become available, additional tiles will be added to this screen. The page displays information such as the successful payment rate, the total number of successful payments, the number of failed payments, and the number of remaining payments. Additionally, it shows the total amount disbursed, the average amount per transaction, the total amount in USDC, and the number of individuals and wallets involved in the transactions.
