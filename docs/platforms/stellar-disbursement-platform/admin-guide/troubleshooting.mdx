## Payments

### Payment Stuck in "Pending" {#payment-stuck-in-pending}

Payments can get stuck in "Pending" status for several reasons. Work through these checks in order.

#### 1. Check TSS Service Health

The Transaction Submission Service (TSS) must be running and reachable.

```bash
# Check TSS container status
docker ps | grep tss

# View recent TSS logs
docker logs --tail 100 <tss-container-name>
```

If TSS is down or unreachable, restart it and monitor the logs for errors.

#### 2. Verify Distribution Account Funds

The distribution account must have sufficient XLM to cover the payment amount plus transaction fees.

Use [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/) or the Stellar CLI to check the balance.

#### 3. Validate Channel Accounts

Channel accounts may become invalid after testnet resets. Look for errors like this in your logs:

<details>
  <summary>Example error: "Resource Missing"</summary>

```
time="2025-12-19T18:43:37.017Z" level=error msg="[DRY_RUN Crash Reporter] unexpected TSS error: preparing bundle for processing: building transaction: horizon response error: getting account detail: horizon error: \"Resource Missing\" - check horizon.Error.Problem for more information" app_version=6.0.1 asset=XLM channel_account=GBKEVxxxx ...
```

</details>

**Diagnosis:** This error means either the **destination account** or the **channel account** doesn't exist on the network. Check both using [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/).

**Solution:**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="destination" label="Destination Account Missing">

The receiver's account hasn't been created on the Stellar network. The account must be funded with the minimum balance (currently 1 XLM on mainnet) before it can receive payments.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="channel" label="Channel Accounts Missing">

Channel accounts may disappear after testnet resets. See [Recreating Channel Accounts](#recreating-channel-accounts) below.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Payment Failed with Operation Error {#payment-failed-operation-error}

When a payment fails, the Status History shows a Horizon error with operation codes that explain why the transaction was rejected.

![Payment Failed Error](/assets/SDP/SDP45.png)

#### Reading the Error

Look for the `operation codes` at the end of the error message:

```
Extras=transaction: tx_fee_bump_inner_failed - inner transaction: tx_failed - operation codes: [ op_no_trust ]
```

The operation code (e.g., `op_no_trust`) tells you exactly what went wrong.

#### Common Operation Codes

| Code | Meaning | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `op_no_trust` | Receiver hasn't established a trustline for this asset | Receiver must add a trustline for the asset (e.g., EURC) before they can receive it |
| `op_underfunded` | Source account doesn't have enough of the asset | Fund the distribution account with more of the asset |
| `op_no_destination` | Destination account doesn't exist | Receiver must create and fund their Stellar account first |

:::info Trustlines explained

On Stellar, accounts must explicitly "trust" an asset before receiving it. This is a security feature—it prevents spam tokens. The receiver needs to add a trustline for the specific asset (like EURC) using their wallet or a Stellar tool.

:::

#### Example: `op_no_trust`

<details>
  <summary>Full error message</summary>

```
horizon response error: StatusCode=400, Type=https://stellar.org/horizon-errors/transaction_failed,
Title=Transaction Failed, Detail=The transaction failed when submitted to the stellar network.
The `extras.result_codes` field on this response contains further details.
Descriptions of each code can be found at: https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/horizon/api-reference/errors/http-status-codes/horizon-specific/transaction-failed/,
Extras=transaction: tx_fee_bump_inner_failed - inner transaction: tx_failed - operation codes: [ op_no_trust ]
```

</details>

**Diagnosis:** The receiver account exists but hasn't added a trustline for the asset you're trying to send (in this case, EURC).

**Solution:** The receiver must add a trustline for the asset before the payment can succeed. Once they've done so, use the **Retry** button in the dashboard to resubmit the payment.

For a complete list of operation result codes, see the [Stellar documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/horizon/api-reference/errors/result-codes/operation-specific/payment).

### Slow Payments Due to Insufficient Channel Accounts {#slow-payments-due-to-insufficient-channel-accounts}

If payments are processing slower than expected, you may not have enough channel accounts. Channel accounts allow the SDP to submit multiple transactions in parallel. Without enough of them, transactions queue up and process sequentially.

#### Symptoms

- Large disbursements take longer than expected to complete
- Payments sit in "Pending" status longer than usual before being submitted

#### 1. Check Current Channel Account Count

View how many channel accounts are currently configured:

```bash
./stellar-disbursement-platform channel-accounts view
```

#### 2. Add More Channel Accounts

Use the `ensure` command to increase the number of channel accounts. This command is idempotent—it only creates new accounts if you have fewer than the specified number:

```bash
# Ensure you have at least 10 channel accounts
./stellar-disbursement-platform channel-accounts ensure 10
```

:::tip How many channel accounts do you need?

The optimal number depends on your disbursement volume:

- **Low volume** (< 100 payments/day): 2–5 accounts
- **Normal volume** (> 100 payments/day): 5–10 accounts

Start with a conservative number and increase if you notice slow processing times.

:::

#### 3. Verify TSS Configuration

The TSS service also has a configuration for how many channel accounts it should utilize. Check that your `--num-channel-accounts` flag (or `NUM_CHANNEL_ACCOUNTS` environment variable) matches or is less than the number of accounts you created:

```bash
# In your TSS configuration
--num-channel-accounts=10
```

If this value is higher than the actual number of channel accounts available, TSS will only use what exists.

## Receiver Communications

Issues with invitations, OTPs, and other messages sent to receivers.

### Receiver Not Receiving the Invitation {#receiver-not-receiving-invitation}

When you trigger a disbursement targeting an unregistered receiver (via email, SMS, or WhatsApp), they should receive an invitation link to register. If they haven't received it, work through these checks.

#### 1. Verify Scheduler Configuration

The invitation job runs on a schedule controlled by an environment variable:

```bash
SCHEDULER_RECEIVER_INVITATION_JOB_SECONDS=30
```

**Check:** Is this set to a reasonable interval (10–60 seconds)? If it's set too high or missing, invitations may be significantly delayed.

#### 2. Check SDP Logs for Submission Failures {#check-logs-submission-failures}

The SDP logs will show whether the message was sent and if the messaging provider accepted or rejected it.

```bash
# Look for messaging-related entries
docker logs <sdp-container-name> 2>&1 | grep -iE "invitation|otp|message"
```

**Common provider issues:**

| Provider | Typical Failure | What to Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS SES | Rate limiting, sandbox mode | Are you in production mode? Check sending limits in AWS console |
| Twilio (SMS) | Geofencing, unverified numbers | Is the destination country enabled? Is your sender ID verified? |
| Twilio (WhatsApp) | Template not approved, 24h window | Is your message template approved? Are you outside the 24h conversation window? |

:::tip

If you're testing, check spam/junk folders first—especially for email invitations.

:::

#### 3. Verify Receiver Contact Info

Double-check that the receiver's contact information (email, phone number) in the disbursement file is:

- Correctly formatted (e.g., phone numbers include country code)
- Valid and reachable
- Not a duplicate that was already processed

---

### Receiver Not Receiving OTP During Registration {#receiver-not-receiving-otp}

During registration, receivers enter the contact details (phone number or email) that the payer used when submitting the disbursement. The SDP sends an OTP to verify ownership of that contact method.

#### 1. Check for Mismatched Contact Info (Most Common)

The most frequent cause is the receiver entering a different email or phone number than what the payer submitted—often without realizing it.

**How to verify:** Check the `receiver_registration_attempts` table, which logs attempts from contacts that couldn't be matched to any receiver in the system.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sdp_<tenant_name>.receiver_registration_attempts
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

If you see the receiver's attempted contact info here, it means:

- They entered something different from what's on file
- You may need to coordinate with the receiver to confirm which contact info is correct
- If the payer made an error, you may need to update the receiver's contact info or create a new disbursement

#### 2. Check for Provider Issues

If the contact info matches but the OTP still isn't arriving, the issue is likely with the messaging provider. See [Check SDP Logs for Submission Failures](#check-logs-submission-failures) above for common provider issues and how to diagnose them.

## Channel Accounts

### Recreating Channel Accounts {#recreating-channel-accounts}

After a testnet reset, your channel accounts no longer exist on-chain but are still referenced in the database. You need to clean up invalid accounts and create new ones.

Run these commands inside the TSS container:

```bash
# Step 1: Remove invalid accounts from the database
./stellar-disbursement-platform channel-account verify --delete-invalid-accounts

# Step 2: Create new channel accounts (adjust the count as needed)
./stellar-disbursement-platform channel-account ensure 10
```

:::tip

The `ensure` command is idempotent—it only creates accounts if you have fewer than the specified number. Running `ensure 10` when you already have 10 valid accounts does nothing.

:::
