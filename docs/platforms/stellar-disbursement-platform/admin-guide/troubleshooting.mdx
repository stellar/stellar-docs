# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues with the Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP).

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Jump to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payment stuck in "Pending" | TSS issue, missing accounts, or insufficient funds | [Pending Payments](#payment-stuck-in-pending) |
| "Resource Missing" in logs | Account doesn't exist on network | [Pending Payments](#payment-stuck-in-pending) |
| Channel account errors after testnet reset | Channel accounts were wiped | [Recreating Channel Accounts](#recreating-channel-accounts) |

---

## Payments

### Payment Stuck in "Pending" {#payment-stuck-in-pending}

Payments can get stuck in "Pending" status for several reasons. Work through these checks in order.

#### 1. Check TSS Service Health

The Transaction Submission Service (TSS) must be running and reachable.

```bash
# Check TSS container status
docker ps | grep tss

# View recent TSS logs
docker logs --tail 100 <tss-container-name>
```

If TSS is down or unreachable, restart it and monitor the logs for errors.

#### 2. Verify Distribution Account Funds

The distribution account must have sufficient XLM to cover the payment amount plus transaction fees.

Use [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/) or the Stellar CLI to check the balance.

#### 3. Validate Channel Accounts

Channel accounts may become invalid after testnet resets. Look for errors like this in your logs:

<details>
    <summary>Example error: "Resource Missing"</summary>

    ```
    time="2025-12-19T18:43:37.017Z" level=error msg="[DRY_RUN Crash Reporter] unexpected TSS error: preparing bundle for processing: building transaction: horizon response error: getting account detail: horizon error: \"Resource Missing\" - check horizon.Error.Problem for more information" app_version=6.0.1 asset=XLM channel_account=GBKEVxxxx ...
    ```

</details>

**Diagnosis:** This error means either the **destination account** or the **channel account** doesn't exist on the network. Check both using [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/).

**Solution:**

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="destination" label="Destination Account Missing">

        The receiver's account hasn't been created on the Stellar network. The account must be funded with the minimum balance (currently 1 XLM on mainnet) before it can receive payments.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="channel" label="Channel Accounts Missing">

        Channel accounts may disappear after testnet resets. See [Recreating Channel Accounts](#recreating-channel-accounts) below.

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Channel Accounts

### Recreating Channel Accounts {#recreating-channel-accounts}

After a testnet reset, your channel accounts no longer exist on-chain but are still referenced in the database. You need to clean up invalid accounts and create new ones.

Run these commands inside the TSS container:

```bash
# Step 1: Remove invalid accounts from the database
./stellar-disbursement-platform channel-account verify --delete-invalid-accounts

# Step 2: Create new channel accounts (adjust the count as needed)
./stellar-disbursement-platform channel-account ensure 10
```

:::tip The `ensure` command is idempotent—it only creates accounts if you have fewer than the specified number. Running `ensure 10` when you already have 10 valid accounts does nothing. :::

## Still Stuck?

If you've worked through the relevant sections and the issue persists:

1. **Collect logs** from all relevant services (SDP, TSS, Anchor Platform)
2. **Note the exact error message** and when it started occurring
3. **Check for recent changes** to configuration, environment, or network (e.g., testnet reset)

Then reach out via the appropriate support channel with this information.
