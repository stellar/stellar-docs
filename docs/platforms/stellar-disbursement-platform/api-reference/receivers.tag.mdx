Endpoints related to receivers. A receiver is an individual receiving a payment in a disbursement. The receiver is tracked by phone number to reduce the need for personally identifiable information. Each receiver must be unique within the disbursement.

Each receiver will have at least one wallet associated with them. The wallet public key will remain null until the receiver registers with a wallet provider and links the wallet to the SDP through SEP-24. Receivers must verify their identity through that process, which requires the SDP to store verification information on receivers like date of birth, national ID number, or personal PIN. This information can be updated by the organization through the receiver endpoints.
