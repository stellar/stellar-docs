## Resource Limits

Soroban introduces smart contracts, marking the most transformative upgrade to the Stellar network to date. To maintain network performance, the ecosystem has decided to upgrade the network in a phased approach where network capacity is increased gradually over time. See [this blog post](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/the-stellar-network-s-phased-rollout-of-smart-contracts-the-road-to-mainnet) for more details and [discord](https://discord.com/invite/zVYdY3ktTn) for current status.

## Resource Fees

Note, that write fees grow linearly from empty ledger to ledger "target size", and then grow linearly, but with a 1000x factor after exceeding the target. This is to bound the ledger size growth.

The ledger rent cost ('Write 1KB' entries in the table) is based on the write fee, rent period and some coefficient. For the temporary storage, the coefficient is 10 months (in ledgers), thus 1 month of temporary entry rent is 1/10 of the rent fee. For persistent storage the coefficient is 1 month (in ledgers) and thus 1 month of rent is equivalent to the write fee.

### Phase 1 (current) {#phase-1}

Phase 1 is meant for network operators to monitor network performance under use. While you'll be able to deploy contracts, Mainnet in Phase 1 has limited throughput. You should not expect more than 1 smart contract transaction per ledger. You can expect throughput to be gradually increased based on network performance and user (your) feedback. See [this blog post](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/the-stellar-network-s-phased-rollout-of-smart-contracts-the-road-to-mainnet) for more details and share your feedback in [discord](https://discord.com/invite/zVYdY3ktTn).

#### Phase 1 Examples

Here are some examples to put things in perspective (the fees are computed at "current" ledger size and would grow as ledger size increases):

| Scenario                                                                               | Phase 1 Cost |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| Upload a new 64KB Wasm (includes 120 day rent payment)                                 | 109.2 XLM    |
| 1 year of 64KB Wasm storage rent                                                       | 327.7 XLM    |
| Bump 64KB Wasm rent by 1 day                                                           | 0.91 XLM     |
| Modify 64 KB contract data entry without increasing the size                           | 0.075 XLM    |
| Create 100 byte contract data entry, e.g. user balance (includes 120 day rent payment) | 0.17 XLM     |
| 1 year of 100 byte storage rent                                                        | 0.512 XLM    |
| Modify 100 byte contract data entry without increasing the size                        | 1150 stroops |

### Phase 0

Phase 0 is meant for network operators to observe and ensure network stability. While you may be able to deploy simple contracts, Mainnet in Phase 0 is not designed for contract development or deployment. Testnet is better suited for this purpose.
