## Current Fees

For the past three hours, inclusion fee statistics on the Mainnet network can be seen below.

:::note

Resource limitations and fees only apply to smart contract transactions. Read more about the inner workings of fees on Stellar in the [Fees section](../learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering.mdx).

## Resource Limits

| Network Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Soroban Txn per ledger | 100 |
| Max CPU Instructions per Txn | 100 million |
| Memory limit per Txn | 40 MB |
| Ledger entry size (including Wasm entries) per Txn | 64 KB |
| Read/Write Ledger entries per Txn | 40 read; 25 write |
| Read/Write bytes per Txn | 130 KB read; 65 KB write |
| Transaction size | 70 KB |
| Persistent entry minimal/initial lifetime | 120 days |
| Temporary entry minimal/initial lifetime | 1 day |
| Max ledger entry expiration bump | 6 months |
| Events+return value size bytes | 8 KB |

## Resource Fees

Note that write fees grow linearly from empty ledger to ledger "target size", and then grow linearly, but with a 1000x factor after exceeding the target. This is to bound the ledger size growth.

The ledger rent cost ('Write 1KB' entries in the table) is based on the write fee, rent period and some coefficient. For the temporary storage, the coefficient is 10 months (in ledgers), thus 1 month of temporary entry rent is 1/10 of the rent fee. For persistent storage the coefficient is 1 month (in ledgers) and thus 1 month of rent is equivalent to the write fee.

| Network Setting | Cost (stroops) |
| :-- | :-- |
| 10,000 instructions | 25 (250,000/max tx) |
| Read 1 ledger entry | 6,250 (250,000/max tx) |
| Write 1 ledger entry | 10,000 (250,000/max tx) |
| Read 1KB from ledger | 1,786 (250,000/max tx) |
| 1KB of transaction size (bandwidth) | 1,624 (113,642/max tx) |
| 1KB of transaction size (history) | 16,235 (1,136,418/max tx) |
| 1KB of Events/return value | 10,000 (80,000/max tx) |
| “Target” ledger size | 13 GB |
| Fee multiplier after reaching the target size | 1,000 |
| Write 1KB to ledger, stroops (empty) | -193,153 (the write cost is always positive; this value is used only for the effective write fee computations) |
| Write 1KB to ledger, stroops (current, 12 GB) | 11,539 (750,000/max tx) |
| Write 1KB to ledger, stroops (target, 12.5 GB) | 57,695 (7,500,000/max tx) |
| Temp entry rent period, ledgers | 2,804 |
| Persistent entry rent period, ledgers | 1,402 |
| Minimum persistent entry TTL, ledgers | 2,073,600 (120 days) |
| Minimum temp entry TTL, ledgers | 17,280 (~1 day) |
