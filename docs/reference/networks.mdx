Testnet and Futurenet have been made available as the first shared test networks to enable developers to learn, tinker, and build applications on Soroban while being able to interact with other participants.

:::caution

Testnet can be reset at any time. A reset erases all accounts, contract data, and contract deployments from the network.

:::caution

All components deployed to Testnet and releases supporting Testnet, such as the [Soroban RPC Server], are in active development and will be unstable at times. They should be treated as development releases with no production capabilities, API or backward compatibility guarantees.
