# Plugins

The Stellar CLI supports plugins in a very simple way. All you need is an executable (it doesn't have to be a binary) in your `PATH` that starts with `stellar-` and the CLI will automatically detect and load it.

You can also install plugins that are made available publicly. One example is [rs-stellar-strkey](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-strkey); you can install it using Rust's cargo:

```sh
cargo install --locked stellar-strkey --features cli
```

That will install the `stellar-strkey` binary in your `~/.cargo/bin` directory. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume that directory is already on your `$PATH`.

:::danger Security Warning

Be careful! Plugins have the same access to your system as the Stellar CLI itself. Only install plugins from sources you trust.

:::

## Listing Available Plugins

To list available plugins on your system, use the command `stellar plugin ls`:

```console
$ stellar plugin ls
Installed Plugins:
    strkey
```

## Creating a New Plugin

As mentioned, before, plugins just need to be an executable available in your `PATH` that start with `stellar-`. Start by creating a new file named `stellar-hello`. This example shows how to create a plugin using `bash`, so you need a system that supports it (Unix-based, or Windows' WSL).

```sh
touch ~/.bin/stellar-hello
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "hello from stellar plugin"
```

Now, make the file executable with `chmod`:

```sh
chmod +x ~/.bin/stellar-hello
```

If everything is set up properly (i.e. the `~/.bin` is in your `PATH` and `~/.bin/stellar-hello` is executable), you should be able to find it:

```console
$ stellar plugin ls
Installed Plugins:
    hello
    strkey
```

Finally, you can execute it by calling `stellar hello`:

```console
$ stellar hello
hello from stellar plugin
```

:::tip

If you're using GitHub to host your plugin's repository, consider adding a `stellar-cli-plugin` [repository topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). This way, your plugin will be listed by `stellar plugin search`.

:::

When you run a command and no built-in command is found, the Stellar CLI falls back to searching for a plugin. This happens even for subcommands. For instance, let's say you're creating a new plugin to generate Ruby bindings for your contract; you can have something like `stellar-contract-bindings-ruby`, and users could execute `stellar contract bindings ruby` rather than the dasherized version.

### Troubleshooting

If Stellar CLI can't find your plugin, make sure you clear all items above:

- Ensure the file starts with `stellar-`
- Verify it's executable (`chmod +x`)
- Check that its location is in your `PATH`
- Restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration
