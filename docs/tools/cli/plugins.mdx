# Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of the Stellar CLI by adding custom commands. The Stellar CLI automatically detects and loads any executable (which doesn't have to be a binary) in your `PATH` that starts with `stellar-`.

## How Plugins Work

Plugins are executables (scripts or binaries) that follow a simple naming convention: they must start with `stellar-`. When you run a command like `stellar hello`, the CLI first checks for a built-in command. If none is found, it searches for a plugin named `stellar-hello` in your `PATH` and executes it if found.

## Installing Plugins

You can install plugins that are made available publicly. For example, you can install [rs-stellar-strkey](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-strkey) using Rust's cargo:

```sh
cargo install --locked stellar-strkey --features cli
```

This installs the `stellar-strkey` binary in your `~/.cargo/bin` directory. Make sure this directory is in your `$PATH` for the CLI to detect it.

:::danger Security Warning

Be careful! Plugins have the same access to your system as the Stellar CLI itself. Only install plugins from sources you trust.

## Listing Available Plugins

To list available plugins on your system, use the command `stellar plugin ls`:

```console
$ stellar plugin ls
Installed Plugins:
    strkey
```

## Creating a New Plugin

To create a plugin, you need an executable file in your `PATH` that starts with `stellar-`. This example shows how to create a simple plugin using `bash` (works on Unix-based systems or Windows' WSL).

### Step 1: Create the Plugin File

Create a new file named `stellar-hello` in a directory that's in your `PATH` (for example, `~/.bin`):

```sh
touch ~/.bin/stellar-hello
```

### Step 2: Add the Plugin Code

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "hello from stellar plugin"
```

### Step 3: Make It Executable

Make the file executable:

```sh
chmod +x ~/.bin/stellar-hello
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

If everything is set up correctly (the directory is in your `PATH` and the file is executable), you should see your plugin listed:

```console
$ stellar plugin ls
Installed Plugins:
    hello
    strkey
```

### Step 5: Use Your Plugin

You can now execute your plugin by calling `stellar hello`:

```console
$ stellar hello
hello from stellar plugin
```

## Plugin Naming and Subcommands

The Stellar CLI automatically searches for plugins when no built-in command matches. This works for both simple commands and subcommands.

For example, if you create a plugin named `stellar-contract-bindings-ruby`, users can execute it using either:

- `stellar contract-bindings-ruby` (with dashes)
- `stellar contract bindings ruby` (with spaces as subcommands)

The CLI converts spaces to dashes when searching for the plugin executable, so both formats work.

:::tip

If you're using GitHub to host your plugin's repository, consider adding a `stellar-cli-plugin` [repository topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). This way, your plugin will be listed by `stellar plugin search`.

## Troubleshooting

If the Stellar CLI can't find your plugin, check the following:

- **Naming**: Ensure the file starts with `stellar-`
- **Permissions**: Verify it's executable using `chmod +x`
- **PATH**: Check that the plugin's directory is in your `PATH` environment variable
- **Shell**: Restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration (e.g., run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`)

You can verify your plugin is in your PATH by running:

```sh
which stellar-hello
```

If this returns a path, your plugin is accessible. If it returns nothing, the plugin's directory is not in your PATH.
