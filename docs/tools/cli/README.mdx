# Stellar CLI

The command line interface to Soroban smart contracts. It allows you to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts; configure identities; generate key pairs; manage networks; and more.

Install Stellar CLI as explained in [Setup](../../build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup.mdx#install-the-stellar-cli). For examples on how to use the Stellar CLI, please see [Stellar CLI Guide](../../build/guides/cli/README.mdx).

The auto-generated comprehensive reference documentation is available [here](./stellar-cli.mdx).

:::note

[Sora] is a cross platform GUI maintained by a third party that is designed to provide a graphical interface to the Stellar CLI. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing projects, identities, networks, contract methods, events, logs and so more in a graphical user interface rather than command line interface.
