# Network Modes

Quickstart can operate in different network modes, and you need to decide which mode is suitable for your purpose before starting the container. The four available network modes are `local`, `testnet`, `futurenet` and `pubnet` (mainnet).

The [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org) can connect to Quickstart, which makes it easy to create and fund accounts.

## Local

The local network mode allows you to customize Quickstart by adding parameters to the container start command. The available parameters are:

- `--protocol-version {version}` to run a specific protocol version (defaults to latest version)
- `--limits {limits}` to configure specific Soroban resource limits to one of:
  - `default` leaves limits set extremely low which is stellar-core's default configuration
  - `testnet` sets limits to match those used on testnet (the default quickstart configuration)
  - `unlimited` sets limits to the maximum resources that can be configured

Some settings and values are specific to the local network mode, which you must be aware of when running Quickstart in local network mode.

### Network Passphrase

The default network passphrase of the local network is:

```sh
Standalone Network ; February 2017
```

Set the network passphrase in the SDK or tool you're using. If clients use an incorrect network passphrase when signing transactions, the transactions will fail with an authentication error.

### Root Account

The root account of the network is fixed to:

```sh
Public Key: GBZXN7PIRZGNMHGA7MUUUF4GWPY5AYPV6LY4UV2GL6VJGIQRXFDNMADI
Secret Key: SC5O7VZUXDJ6JBDSZ74DSERXL7W3Y5LTOAMRF7RQRL3TAGAPS7LUVG3L
```

The root account is derived from the network passphrase and if the network passphrase is changed, the root account will change. To retrieve the root account details when changing the network passphrase, view the logs for stellar-core on its first start. See [Viewing](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart?tab=readme-ov-file#viewing-logs) logs for more details.

In local network mode, a ledger occurs every one second and so transactions are finalized faster than on deployed networks.

## Testnet

The testnet network mode is recommended for software development. Accounts created on the testnet can be funded with Friendbot (faucet) so you don’t have to worry about losing real tokens when testing your software.

## Futurenet

The futurenet network mode works like the testnet, and the biggest difference is that it contains the latest bleeding-edge features that haven’t made it to testnet yet. This can be useful for developers building smart contracts that rely on new features that are not available on testnet, or test existing smart contracts ahead of changes to test- and mainnet.

## Pubnet

In pubnet network mode, Quickstart will be a part of the public production Steller network, also known as the mainnet. In pubnet mode, Quickstart will consume more disk, memory, and CPU resources because of the size of the ledger and frequency of transactions. If disk space warnings occur and the image is being used on a Docker runtime that uses a VM, like that of macOS and Windows, the VM may need to have its disk space allocation increased.

:::caution

Quickstart is not suitable for any production use as it has a fixed root account. Any private network intended for production use would also require a unique network passphrase.
