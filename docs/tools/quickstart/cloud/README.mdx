# Cloud Deployment

Quickstart can be deployed to any cloud to create a shareable test network for coordinated and multi-person testing.

Any platform supporting a container runtime can deploy the `docker.io/stellar/quickstart:latest` image.

:::warning Quickstart is designed for development and testing, and not production. :::

See some examples for how to deploy on different providers:
