# Cloud Deployment

Quickstart can be deployed to a cloud platform to create a shareable test network for coordinated and multi-person testing.

Any platform supporting a container runtime can deploy the Quickstart image:

```
docker.io/stellar/quickstart:latest
```

Use the following environment variables to configure the image:

- `NETWORK` - The network that the container will setup or connect to. One of:
  - `local` - A new local network will be created for development / testing.
  - `testnet` - The container will connect to the public testnet.
- `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` - For `local` networks the network passphrase that will be used.
- `RANDOMIZE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` - For `local` networks the network passphrase will have a random suffix.
- `LIMITS` - The network limits that will be configured for smart contracts. One of:
  - `testnet` - Limits that match the public testnet.
  - `unlimited` - Max limits supported by the network under any configuration. Useful for experimental testing prior to optimization.

:::warning

Quickstart is designed for development and testing, not production.
