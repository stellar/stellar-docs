# Fly.io

Create a `fly.toml` file with the following:

```toml
app = "stellar-unet" # Change the name of your app.
primary_region = "ord" # Change the region to your closest region from https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions.

[build]
image = "stellar/quickstart:latest"

[env]
NETWORK="local"
LIMITS="testnet" # Or "unlimited" to increase limits to their max.
RANDOMIZE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="true" # Or turn off to get a stable network passphrase, 'Standalone Network ; February 2017'.

[http_service]
internal_port = 8000
force_https = true
auto_stop_machines = "off"
auto_start_machines = true
min_machines_running = 1

[deploy]
strategy = "immediate"

[[vm]]
memory = "1gb"
cpu_kind = "shared"
cpus = 1
```

Create a fly app with:

```
fly create
```

Deploy the quickstart image with the `fly.toml` configuration with:

```
fly deploy --ha=false
```

>! NOTE
> The `--ha=false` tells fly to only deploy a single instance, not multiple.
