# Fly.io

Deploy to Fly.io using the following steps.

0. Install the Fly CLI.

   See [fly.io/docs/flyctl/install](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install).

1. Create a fly app with:

   ```
   fly create
   ```

2. Create a `fly.toml` file starting with the following template.

   ```toml
   # Deploy this Fly app with:
   # fly app create
   # fly deploy --ha=false

   # Change the name of your app to the app created with 'fly app create'.
   app = "stellar"

   [build]
   image = "docker.io/stellar/quickstart:latest"

   [env]
   # NETWORK chooses the network the image will connect to. Use "local" to start a
   # new network local to the container, ideal for development and testing.
   NETWORK="local"

   # LIMITS sets the network configuration that is deployed on network start.
   # - "testnet" to match the network configuration of the public Stellar testnet.
   # - "unlimited" raises limits to max, useful for testing prior to optimization.
   #LIMITS="testnet"

   # RANDOMIZE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE sets a random network passphrase on network
   # start. Find out what the network passphrase is by requesting the root URL.
   #RANDOMIZE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="true"

   # NETWORK_PASSPHRASE sets a network passphrase to uniquely identify the network
   # and prevent use of transactions for the test network with other networks.
   #NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="My Network"

   [http_service]
   internal_port = 8000
   force_https = true
   auto_stop_machines = "off"
   auto_start_machines = true
   min_machines_running = 1

   [deploy]
   strategy = "immediate"

   [[vm]]
   memory = '1gb'
   cpu_kind = 'shared'
   cpus = 1
   ```

3. Deploy the image:

   ```
   fly deploy --ha=false
   ```
