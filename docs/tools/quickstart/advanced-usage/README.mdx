# Advanced Usage

Quickstart works out of the box, and when launched using the Stellar CLI, no setup or configuration is required. While the standard configuration may work for many use cases, it may not fit everyoneâ€™s needs. If a custom setup and configuration is needed, the Quickstart container can be run using the docker CLI.
