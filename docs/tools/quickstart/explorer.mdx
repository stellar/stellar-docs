When you run **Stellar Lab** via **Quickstart**, a lightweight block/transaction explorer is automatically available alongside Lab. This makes it easy to inspect network activity on your local Quickstart network while you build and test.

### URLs

**Lab (home):** `http://localhost:8000/lab`

**Explorer:** `http://localhost:8000/lab/transactions-explorer`

If youâ€™re using a custom port or host when starting Quickstart, replace `localhost:8000` with your chosen address.

### What You Can Do with the Explorer

- Browse recent transactions on your Quickstart network.
- Drill into a transaction to view its details (hash, result, involved operations, etc.).
- Use it alongside Lab tools (e.g., building/signing transactions) to quickly verify results from the local network.

### TL;DR

1. Start Quickstart (per the repo instructions).
2. Open Lab: `http://localhost:8000/lab`.
3. Open the Explorer: `http://localhost:8000/lab/transactions-explorer`.
4. Build and submit transactions in Lab, then switch to the Explorer to confirm they landed.
