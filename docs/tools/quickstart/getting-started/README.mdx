# Getting Started

In this guide, you will set up Quickstart using the Stellar CLI. Quickstart will use the standard configuration, which will work for many use cases. For a more customized setup of Quickstart, see the Advanced Usage section.

## Prerequisites

Before following the steps in this guide, the following must be installed and setup on your local system:

- [Stellar CLI](../../../build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup.mdx#install-the-stellar-cli)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

## Start Quickstart

When you use the Stellar CLI to start Quickstart, the docker image will automatically be downloaded, and the standard configuration applied. All you need to do to get started is to run this command:

```sh
stellar container start local
```

In this example, the network mode local is chosen, see the Network Modes section for more information about available network modes. After running the command, Quickstart is running on your local system. In the next step, you will use Stellar Lab to verify Quickstart is working correctly.
