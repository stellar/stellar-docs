# Connect Stellar Lab

One way to confirm that Quickstart was successfully started and is available is to connect to Quickstart from [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org).

Navigate to [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org) and in the top right corner, use the dropdown to select the Custom network. This will allow you to provide connection details - use these testnet details:

- RPC URL: `http://localhost:8000/rpc`
- Horizon URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- Network passphrase: `Standalone Network ; February 2017`

Switch to the Custom network and you can start to interact with Quickstart. A good first task could be to navigate to the Account tab, create an account, and fund it with Friendbot (faucet).
