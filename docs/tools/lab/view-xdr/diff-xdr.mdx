## Comparing XDR Data

On this page, you can compare two base-64 encoded [XDRs](../../../learn/fundamentals/data-format/xdr.mdx) by viewing their JSON difference. Enter the Original XDR in the first input field, followed by the Changed XDR in the second field. Both XDRs must share the same XDR type, which is automatically populated when a valid Original XDR value is entered. If the suggested type appears incorrect, you can select an alternative from the dropdown menu. A search function is available to help locate the appropriate type.

## Understanding the Output

Once both XDR values are entered, a comparison view will display below, highlighting the differences between the two objects. Below each difference, you will find a button to copy the corresponding JSON data.
