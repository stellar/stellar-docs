# View XDR

This section provides tools to work with [XDR](../../../learn/fundamentals/data-format/xdr.mdx) (External Data Representation) data. You can decode XDR into easy-to-read JSON format, convert JSON back into XDR format, or compare two XDR data sets to view their differences side-by-side. Learn more about XDR-JSON conversion [here](../../../learn/fundamentals/data-format/xdr-json.mdx).
