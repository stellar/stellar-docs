Stellar Lab provides a comprehensive suite of tools for exploring, testing, and interacting with smart contracts on the Stellar network. These tools are designed to help developers understand contract behavior, debug issues, and test contract interactions without writing additional code.

:::tip

If you don't know any Stellar smart contract ID, view [Smart Contract List](https://lab.stellar.org/smart-contracts/contract-list) and click on any of the items. This will direct you to the "Contract Explorer" page, where the selected ID is pre-filled. Load the contract and check it out!

### Tips for New Developers

- **Start with Testnet**: Always begin your development and testing on Testnet where XLM is free and mistakes have no real-world consequences
- **Examine Example Contracts**: Study well-known contracts to understand common patterns and best practices
- **Save Your Configurations**: Type in the Contract ID you want to explore on [Contract Explorer](https://lab.stellar.org/smart-contracts/contract-explorer), it will give you an option to save for quick access via 'Save Contract ID'
- **Check Network Status**: Ensure you're connected to the correct network
