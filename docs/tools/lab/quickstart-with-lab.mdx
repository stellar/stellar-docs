# Using Lab with Quickstart

## Overview

[Quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) provides an easy way to set up a local Stellar network environment. Specifically, Quickstart docker image bundles Stellar Core with Horizon, RPC, Friendbot, and the necessary PostgreSQL databases. Now it is possible to use Stellar Lab as an interface on Quickstart.

## Prerequisites

- [Stellar CLI](/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Start Quickstart

Quickstart can be started for different networks. In this example, we will start Quickstart for `testnet`. Start Quickstart with the Stellar CLI using the following command:

```sh
stellar network container start testnet
```

Quickstart will usually start on `http://localhost:8000`. With this information, we can now configure Stellar Lab to use the local network.

## Configure Stellar Lab to use Local Horizon and Local RPC

1. Open Stellar Lab network selector on the upper right hand corner.
2. Select `Custom` network in the dropdown.
3. For the RPC URL, input `http://localhost:8000/rpc`.
4. For the Horizon URL, input `http://localhost:8000.`.
5. For the [network passphrase](/docs/networks), input `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`
6. Click the button `Switch to Custom Network` and switched to using your Quickstart.

You should be able to use Horizon endpoints, RPC endpoints, Friendbot on Lab, with requests now send to your local environment (Quickstart). Lab gives you a user friendly interface to interact with you local environment.
