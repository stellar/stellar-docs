### [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org)

Stellar Lab is our go-to tool for development, experimenting, and testing, as well as [exploring APIs](https://lab.stellar.org/endpoints) developers use to interact with the Stellar network. Whether you're a developer seeking to [test transactions](https://lab.stellar.org/transaction/build), [deploy](https://lab.stellar.org/smart-contracts/deploy-contract) and [invoke smart contracts](https://lab.stellar.org/smart-contracts/contract-explorer), or explore RPC methods or Horizon endpoints, Stellar Lab provides a modern and user-friendly interface that makes the process smooth and intuitive.

### Features of Stellar Lab

- **[Easily Create Accounts](https://lab.stellar.org/account/create)**: Create Accounts on Mainnet, Testnet, and Futurenet using a web UI. You can use [Friendbot](https://lab.stellar.org/account/fund?$=network$id=testnet&label=Testnet&horizonUrl=https:////horizon-testnet.stellar.org&passphrase=Test%20SDF%20Network%20/;%20September%202015;;) to fund those accounts directly on Lab for Testnet and Futurenet. You can also add a trustline to USDC and EURC on Testnet.

- **[Smart Contract Deployment](https://lab.stellar.org/smart-contracts/deploy-contract)**: Deploy smart contracts directly from the Lab interface without needing command-line tools. Upload your contract WASM files and deploy them to the network with a user-friendly workflow.

- **[Invoke Smart Contracts](https://lab.stellar.org/smart-contracts/contract-explorer)**: Interact with deployed smart contracts through an intuitive interface. Select contract functions, fill in parameters with type hints, simulate transactions, and invoke contract methods — all from your browser.

- **[Transaction Dashboard](https://lab.stellar.org/transaction-dashboard)**: View comprehensive transaction details including XDR, operations, results, and metadata. Explore transaction history, examine individual operations, and debug transaction failures with detailed error information.

- **[Access RPC Methods and Horizon Endpoints](https://lab.stellar.org/endpoints)**: Leverage powerful Stellar RPC methods and Stellar Horizon endpoints in a web UI to interact with the Stellar network and obtain crucial data. Try RPC methods to get states from the ledger like accounts, trustlines, contract WASM, and more.

- **[Simulate](https://lab.stellar.org/transaction/simulate) and [Submit](https://lab.stellar.org/transaction/submit)**: Lab supports the ability to use custom RPC providers so that you can simulate transactions, save transactions, and submit transactions directly using Lab. You can also submit transactions using Horizon.

- **[Save and Share API Requests](https://lab.stellar.org/endpoints/saved)**: Easily save your requests and transactions for the future or share them with teammates to build faster together.

- **[XDR ⇔ JSON Support](https://lab.stellar.org/xdr/view)**: We have introduced a canonical [XDR to JSON mapping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/stellar-xdr-json-web) which is used on Stellar Lab (also used in the [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli)). You can see this at work in the Lab where [XDR can be converted to JSON](https://lab.stellar.org/xdr/view).

- **Mobile Friendly**: We heard that you use Lab on mobile, so we optimized the Lab to have a mobile responsive layout.
