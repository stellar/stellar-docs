On and off-ramps (called [anchors](../../learn/fundamentals/anchors.mdx) in the Stellar universe) that connect the Stellar network to traditional financial rails.

Stellar has anchor services operating worldwide. View the [Anchor Directory](https://anchors.stellar.org/) for information on Stellar anchors.

Anchors can issue their own assets on the Stellar network, or they can honor assets that already exist.

You can set up an anchor by using the SDF-maintained [Anchor Platform](/platforms/anchor-platform), which is the easiest way to deploy an anchor service compatible with Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs).
