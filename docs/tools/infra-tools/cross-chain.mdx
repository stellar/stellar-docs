Bridges and messaging layers that connect different blockchains.

## [Axelar](https://www.axelar.network/)

Axelar Network is the universal interoperability network that securely connects all blockchain ecosystems, applications, assets, and users.

Get set up to write cross-chain smart contracts on Stellar using Axelar in the following guides.

### Learn about the Stellar GMP contracts

General Message Passing (GMP) is a cross-chain communication protocol that allows smart contracts on different blockchains to communicate with each other. With GMP, Stellar contracts can:

- Send messages to contracts on other chains like Ethereum, Avalanche, Base, Polygon, etc.
- Receive and process messages from contracts on other chains.
- Execute cross-chain operations securely and efficiently.

### Learn about the Stellar Interchain Token Service (ITS)

The Interchain Token Service (ITS) enables tokens to scale across multiple chains by supporting both existing and newly minted tokens, preserving native-like fungibility and functionality on connected EVM chains, and automating deployment and maintenance to help teams easily manage supply on an open, scalable, and secure network. For the Stellar ecosystem, ITS offers:

- Creation of new tokens that can exist on multiple blockchains.
- Connecting existing Stellar tokens to other blockchain ecosystems.
- Secure transfers of tokens between Stellar and other chains.
