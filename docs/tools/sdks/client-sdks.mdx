# Client & XDR SDKs

Client and XDR SDKs are used by applications to interact with the network.

:::note

For SDKs for building smart contracts, see [Contract SDKs](./contract-sdks.mdx).

:::

All SDKs are open-source; file a GitHub issue or pull request in the specific SDK repository if you have questions or suggestions.

Each SDK has its own source code and documentation. Learn how to use a specific SDK by referring to the documentation.

## JavaScript SDK

[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk) | [Docs](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/) | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/stellar-sdk)

**The JavaScript SDK is maintained by SDF.**

`stellar-sdk` is the JavaScript library for communicating with Stellar RPC and Horizon. It supports building transactions on the Stellar network. It is used for building Stellar apps either in the browser or a Node.js environment.

It provides:

- A networking layer API for Stellar RPC methods and the Horizon API.
- Facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with an RPC instance, for communicating with a Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network state.

## Python SDK

[Python SDK](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base) | [Docs](https://stellar-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [Examples](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base/tree/master/examples)

**The Python SDK is maintained by dedicated community developers.**

`py-stellar-base` is a Python library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. It is used for building Stellar apps on Python. It supports Python 3.7+ as well as PyPy 3.7+.

This SDK is maintained by a dedicated community developer.

It provides:

- A networking layer API for Horizon endpoints.
- Facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with a Stellar Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network history.

## Rust

Functionality for interacting with Stellar data can be found in the following Rust crates:

- `stellar-xdr` – [Code](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-xdr) | [Docs](https://docs.rs/stellar-xdr)
