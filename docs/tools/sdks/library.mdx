Interact with the Stellar network using the SDK in your preferred language. The JavaScript, Go, and Rust SDKs are maintained by SDF and the rest are maintained by dedicated community developers. All SDKs are open-source; file a GitHub issue or pull request in the specific SDK repository if you have questions or suggestions.

Each SDK has its own source code and documentation. Learn how to use a specific SDK by referring to the documentation- most docs offer practical examples that demonstrate how to construct and submit transactions and interact with Horizon endpoints.

### Soroban Rust SDK

### JavaScript SDK

[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk) | [Docs](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/) | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/stellar-sdk)

`stellar-sdk` is the JavaScript library for communicating with a Stellar RPC server, communicating with the Horizon API, and building transactions on the Stellar network. It is used for building Stellar apps either on Node.js or in the browser.

It provides:

- A networking layer API for Stellar RPC methods and the Horizon API.
- Facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with an RPC instance, for communicating with a Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network state.

### Python SDK

[Python SDK](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base) | [Docs](https://stellar-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [Examples](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base/tree/master/examples)

`py-stellar-base` is a Python library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. It is used for building Stellar apps on Python. It supports Python 3.7+ as well as PyPy 3.7+.

This SDK is maintained by a dedicated community developer.

It provides:

- A networking layer API for Horizon endpoints.
- Facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with a Stellar Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network history.

### iOS SDK

[iOS SDK](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk) | [Docs](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk/tree/master/docs) | [Smart Contract Docs](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk/blob/master/soroban.md)

The `stellar-ios-mac-sdk` is an open source Stellar SDK for iOS & Mac. It provides APIs to build transactions and connect to Horizon. It also provides functionality to deploy and invoke Soroban smart contracts and communicates with the Stellar RPC Server.

The iOS SDK is maintained by dedicated community developer, Soneso.

### Java SDK

[Java SDK](https://github.com/lightsail-network/java-stellar-sdk) | [Docs](https://lightsail-network.github.io/java-stellar-sdk/)

`java-stellar-sdk` provides APIs to build transactions and connect to Horizon and also provides functionality to deploy and invoke Soroban smart contracts and communicates with the Stellar RPC Server.

### Go

This SDK is split up into separate packages, all of which you can find in the [Go monorepo README](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/docs/reference/readme.md). The two key libraries for interacting with Horizon are `txnbuild`, which enables the construction, signing, and encoding of Stellar transactions, and `horizonclient`, which provides a web client for interfacing with Horizon server REST endpoints to retrieve ledger information and submit transactions built with `txnbuild`.

- txnbuild: [SDK](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/txnbuild) | [Docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/txnbuild)
- Horizonclient: [SDK](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/horizonclient) | [Docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/horizonclient)
