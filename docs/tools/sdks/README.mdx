The SDK section is split into three categories:

- [Contract SDKs](./contract-sdks.mdx) that are used to build smart contracts that will be deployed to the Stellar network;
- [Client & XDR SDKs](./client-sdks.mdx) that are used by applications to interact with the network;
- [Build your own SDK](./build-your-own.mdx) that details the minimum requirements for building your own SDK.
