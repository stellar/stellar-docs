:::note

This is for building an SDK for writing smart contracts.

:::

Soroban currently has one SDF-maintained SDK for writing contracts in Rust, which can be found [here][soroban-sdk]. A community-maintained SDK is available for writing contracts in AssemblyScript, which can be found [here][as-soroban-sdk].

To build SDKs for other languages a few things need to be included in the SDK to provide contracts with the foundation they need to accept inputs, decode them, store data, call other contracts, etc.

Below is a list of functionality a Soroban SDK needs to support those things, as well as some details on what an SDK can provide in regards to testing capabilities.

## Functionality

### Value Conversions

- [Val] encode/decode
- [Object] encode/decode
- [Symbol] encode/decode
- [Error] encode/decode

### Host Functions

The host functions defined in [env.json] are functions callable from within the Wasm Guest environment. These need to be available to contracts to call, in some form, ideally wrapped so that contracts have a nicer interface.

Host functions have friendly names in the file above, such as `get_ledger_version`, however in the Wasm they are only importable via short names, such as `x.4`. The letter proceeding the dot is the module, and the value after the dot is the function name. The mappins are available in env.rs.

### SDK Types

All the types in [soroban-sdk](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk) should be supported. Notably:

- [Map]
- [Vec]
- [Bytes]

### User Defined Types

Contracts should be able to create user defined types, such as structs, unions, or enums, and have them be transmitted to the host for storing and transmitted back for loading.

SDKs do this by converting objects to and from a `Val`. In the [soroban-sdk] this is referred to as a [Val].

#### Structs

Structs with named fields should be translated into a `Map` with keys as `Symbol`s and the values as the field value, i.e. `Map<Symbol, V>`.

Structs with unnamed fields should be translated into a `Vec` with the values as the elements. i.e. `Vec<V>`.

#### Unions

Unions (or enums in some languages) with named variants and unit or tuple values should be translated into a `Vec` with the first element as a `Symbol` of the name of the variant, and zero or more additional elements representing a value stored with the variant.

#### Enums

Enums with integer values should be translated into a `u32`.

### User Defined Errors

Errors are `u32` values that are translated into a [Error].

### Environment Meta Generation

Contracts must contain a Wasm custom section with name `contractenvmetav0` and containing a serialized [`SCEnvMetaEntry`]. The interface version stored within should match the version of the host functions supported.

### Contract Spec Generation

Contracts should contain a Wasm custom section with name `contractspecv0` and containing a serialized stream of [`SCSpecEntry`]. There should be a `SCSpecEntry` for every function, struct, and union exported by the contract.

### Contract Meta Generation

Contracts may optionally contain a Wasm custom section with name `contractmetav0` and containing a serialized [`SCMetaEntry`]. Contracts may store any metadata in the entries that can be used by applications and tooling off-network.

## Testing

Any Soroban SDK ideally provides a test environment for executing contract functions in the context of a Soroban runtime environment. The [soroban-sdk] does this by embedding the Soroban environment Rust library, [soroban-env-host].

The test environment should include:

- Invoking contract functions.
- Integration testing across multiple contracts.
