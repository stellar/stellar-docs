# Contract SDKs

Contract SDKs are used to build smart contracts that will be deployed to the Stellar network.

:::note

For Client and XDR SDKs, visit this [page](./client-sdks.mdx).

:::

All SDKs are open-source; file a GitHub issue or pull request in the specific SDK repository if you have questions or suggestions.

Each SDK has its own source code and documentation. Learn how to use a specific SDK by referring to the documentation.

## Soroban Rust SDK

[Rust SDK](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk) | [Docs](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk)

**The Rust SDK is maintained by SDF.**

The `soroban-sdk` Rust crate contains the Soroban Rust SDK for building smart contracts for Stellar.

Report issues and share feedback about the `soroban-sdk` [here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).

**Add `soroban-sdk` as a dependency** by using [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/soroban-sdk) to find the version of the most recent SDK release.

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` to import the `soroban-sdk` and replace `$VERSION` with the released version.

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = $VERSION

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = $VERSION, features = ["testutils"] }
```

## Solidity SDK

[Hyperledger Solang compiler](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang) | [Docs](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.4/)

**The Solang compiler is maintained by the Hyperledger community.**

Solang is an llvm-based compiler for Solidity that can target multiple blockchains, including Stellar.

The supported Solidity examples can be found within the [Solang repository](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/tree/main/examples/soroban).

You can report issues and add requests for features to the Solang repository [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/issues/new/choose).

Solang compiler also provides a Web IDE that you can use to compile, deploy and interact with Solidity contracts on Soroban. You can access the Web IDE [here](https://solang.io/).

## AssemblyScript SDK

[AssemblyScript SDK](https://github.com/Soneso/as-soroban-sdk)

**The AssemblyScript SDK is maintained by dedicated community developers.**

The `as-soroban-sdk` is an open source SDK that supports writing programs for the Soroban smart contract platform by using the AssemblyScript programming language.

The AssemblyScript Soroban SDK is maintained by dedicated community developer, Soneso. Report issues and share feedback [here](https://github.com/Soneso/as-soroban-sdk/issues/new).

## OpenZeppelin Contract and Extension Crates

OpenZeppelin Contracts are published in four crates:

- Stellar Macros: https://crates.io/crates/stellar-macros
- Stellar Access Control: https://crates.io/crates/stellar-access
- Stellar Contract Utilities: https://crates.io/crates/stellar-contract-utils
- Stellar Tokens: https://crates.io/crates/stellar-tokens

Refer to the [OpenZeppelin for Stellar Contracts](../openzeppelin-contracts.mdx#openzeppelin-stellar-contracts-and-utilities) page for additional information.

## Stellar Axelar Std Derive Rust Crate

Axelar has created a Rust crate with useful macros for Stellar smart contract development. Please see Rust Crate [`stellar_axelar_std_derive`](https://axelarnetwork.github.io/axelar-amplifier-stellar/stellar_axelar_std_derive/index.html) for Attribute Macros and Derive Macros, and additional information.
