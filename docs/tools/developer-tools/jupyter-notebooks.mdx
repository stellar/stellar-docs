# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are a document format that can include code, text, and other rich output. And with the appropriate setup they support Soroban Rust contracts.

To use Soroban contracts in a Jupyter Notebook, the following setup is required. The following setup uses Visual Studio Code, but any Jupyter client and server can be used.

:::caution

Rust support in Jupyter Notebooks is experimental. You might run into bugs, or unexpected behavior.

:::

## Getting Started

1. Install [Visual Studio Code] (VSCode)
2. Install the [Jupyter Notebook extension] in VSCode
3. Install the `evcxr` Rust Jupyter kernel with:
   ```
   cargo install --locked evcxr_jupyter
   evcxr_jupyter --install
   ```
4. Run the `Create: New Jupyter Notebook` command in VSCode
5. Click the `Detecting` button in the top right.
6. Select `Jupyter Kernel...`
7. Select `Rust`
8. Enter on the first line an import of the `soroban-sdk` dependency with the `testutils` feature enabled.
   ```rust
   :dep soroban-sdk = { version = "21.3.0", features = ["testutils"] }
   ```
9. Enter a contract. For example:

   ```rust
   use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl};

   #[contract]
   pub struct Contract;

   #[contractimpl]
   impl Contract {
       pub fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
           x+y
       }
   }
   ```

10. Enter some code to create a Soroban environment, register the contract, and invoke it.

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{Env};

let env = Env::default();
let id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
let client: ContractClient = ContractClient::new(&env, &id);
client.add(&1, &2)
```

11. Click the play button to run the code.

Congratulations you have a Jupyter Notebook with contract code that should look something like the screenshot below, ready for hacking and experimenting.
