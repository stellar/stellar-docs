# Viewing Logs

You can view logs by starting a new interactive shell inside the running container:

```sh
docker exec -it stellar /bin/bash
```

The command above assumes that you started your container with the name `stellar`. Replace that name with whatever you chose, if different. When run, it will open an interactive shell running as root within the container.

Logs can be found within the container at the path `/var/log/supervisor/`. A file is kept for both the **_stdout_** and **_stderr_** of the processes managed by [supervisord](https://supervisord.org/index.html). Additionally, you can use the `tail` command provided by supervisord.

Alternatively, to tail all logs into the container's output for all services, append the `--logs` option.
