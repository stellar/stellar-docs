# Diagnostic Events

Soroban diagnostic events contain logs about internal events that have occurred while a contract is executing. They're particularly useful for debugging why a contract is trapped (panicked).

To enable Soroban diagnostic events, provide the following command line flag when starting the container: `--enable-soroban-diagnostic-events`

In local network mode, diagnostics are enabled by default and can be disabled with: `--disable-soroban-diagnostic-events`

:::info

Diagnostic events are unmetered and their execution is not metered or constrained by network limits or transaction resource limits. This means the resources consumed by an instance with diagnostic events enabled may exceed resources typically required by a deployment with diagnostic events disabled.
