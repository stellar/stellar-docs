# Container

Quickstart is packaged as a docker container image and provides a default, non-validating, ephemeral configuration that should work for most developers. By configuring a container using this image with a host-based volume (described below in the "Configuration" section) an operator gains access to full configuration customization and persistence of data.

The Quickstart [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/quickstart) uses the following software:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
* [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core)
* [horizon](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon)
* [friendbot](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/friendbot)
* [stellar-rpc](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/tree/main/cmd/stellar-rpc)
* [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/)

The Stellar CLI has commands for starting and stopping a Quickstart container, and also a command to get logs from a running container. See Stellar CLI [documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli#stellar-container) for more information.
