# Service Options

All network modes run all the services (Core, Horizon, and RPC) by default, but the --enable option can be used to enable just some of the services. The enable option behavior is slightly different in local network mode.

The option takes a comma-separated list of service names to enable. To enable all services which is the default behavior, use:

```sh
--enable core,horizon,rpc
```

To run only select services, simply specify only those services. For example, to enable the RPC, use:

```sh
 --enable rpc
```

:::info

In local network mode, the core service always runs no matter what options are passed, the Friendbot faucet service runs whenever Horizon is running, and Horizon is run when RPC is requested so that Friendbot is available.
