# Faucet

Quickstart uses Friendbot as a native asset faucet for testnet, futurenet, and local networks, just like Friendbot is used on the public testnet and futurenet.

Friendbot is available on `:8000/friendbot` and can be used to fund a new account. For example:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/friendbot?addr=G...
```

In local network mode, a local Friendbot is running. In testnet and futurenet network modes, requests to the local `:8000/friendbot` endpoint will be proxied to the Friendbot deployments for the respective network.
