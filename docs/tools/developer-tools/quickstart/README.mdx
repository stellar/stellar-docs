# Quickstart

Quickstart is a local Stellar network environment (node) that allows developers to run a local version of the Stellar network for development and testing. Quickstart runs a local version of Stellar Core, Horizon, RPC, and everything else needed to replicate the public network.

For more information about running Stellar services in production, see the documentation for the individual services here:

- [How to run Stellar Core in production](../../../validators/README.mdx)
- [How to run Horizon in production](../../../data/horizon/admin-guide/overview.mdx)
- [How to run RPC in production](../../../data/rpc/admin-guide.mdx)

Quickstart is intended for use in development, not in production, although running it in public mode will cause it to join the public network.

**Run Quickstart**

Ready to get started? The Getting Started section of the Quickstart documentation will show how to run Quickstart, but there are some configurations to decide on first. Most importantly, the network mode Quickstart will run in (pubnet, testnet, futurenet, local). Read about the modes in the Network Modes section.

:::info

Quickstart can be deployed using the Getting Started guide, but the configurations used in the guide may not be ideal for your use case, so please familiarize yourself with the options to configure Quickstart to fit your use case.
