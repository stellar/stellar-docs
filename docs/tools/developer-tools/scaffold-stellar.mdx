**Scaffold Stellar** is a developer toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. It helps you go from idea to working full-stack dApp faster — by providing CLI tools, reusable contract templates, a smart contract registry, and a modern frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Description | Install Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) | For writing and compiling smart contracts | `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \| sh` |
| [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) | For frontend development | Download from official site |
| [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) | For building, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts | [`Link for the repo`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) |

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the required CLI tools:

```bash
# Install stellar-scaffold CLI
cargo install stellar-scaffold-cli

# Install registry CLI (to easily deploy your contract to the registry)
cargo install stellar-registry-cli
```

### Creating a New Project

1. Initialize a new project:

```bash
stellar scaffold init my-project
cd my-project
```

You will have a few sample contracts already in the project, or you can start from the [OpenZeppelin Wizard](./openzepplin-contracts) to customize your contract and start a Scaffold Stellar project from there.

2. Set up your development environment:

```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

3. Start development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll have a running dApp, with a couple of contracts to start with, ready to start building!

Explore the `environments.toml` file to customize your development environment(s).

## Project Structure

When you run `stellar scaffold init`, it creates a full-stack project structure with example contracts and a modern frontend:

```
my-project/
├── contracts/            # Rust smart contracts (compiled to WASM)
├── packages/            # Auto-generated TypeScript contract clients
├── src/                # React frontend code
│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── contracts/      # Contract interaction logic
│   ├── App.tsx        # Main app component
│   └── main.tsx       # Entry point
├── environments.toml   # Configuration per environment (dev/test/prod)
├── .env               # Local environment variables
├── package.json       # Frontend packages
└── target/           # Build outputs
```

This template provides a ready-to-use frontend application with example smart contracts and their TypeScript clients. The frontend is set up with `Vite`, `React`, and includes basic components for interacting with the contracts.

## Features

- **CLI Plugins for Stellar**

  - `stellar scaffold init`: Initialize new Stellar smart contract projects
  - `stellar scaffold upgrade`: Transform existing Stellar contract workspaces into Scaffold projects
  - `stellar scaffold build`: Build contracts and generate TypeScript clients
  - `stellar scaffold watch`: Development mode with hot reloading
  - `stellar registry`: Publish, deploy, and manage smart contracts

- **Environment Management**

  - Environment-specific builds (development, testing, staging, production)
  - Seamless integration with both local and deployed contracts
  - Network configuration via `environments.toml`
  - Support for multiple deployment environments

- **Smart Contract Registry**
  - On-chain publishing platform for Wasm binaries
  - Version management and contract naming
  - Contract verification and dependency management
  - Secure deployment workflow for testnet and mainnet
