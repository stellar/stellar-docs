### [Account Viewer](https://accountviewer.stellar.org/)

A stripped-down wallet where you can check an account’s XLM balance and send simple payments on Testnet and Mainnet. Account Viewer's [source code](https://github.com/stellar/account-viewer-v2) is also useful and instructive for developers building wallet-related features into their applications.

### [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/)

SDF’s flagship non-custodial wallet extension that allows users to sign Stellar transactions via their browser. Freighter wallet's codebase is open sourced here: https://github.com/stellar/freighter.

### [NEAR Intents](https://docs.near.org/chain-abstraction/intents/overview)

NEAR Intents is a multichain transaction protocol for wallets that allows users or AI agents to simply state the outcome they want (like swapping Token A for Token B), and then lets a network of off‑chain market makers (called solvers) compete to fulfill that request; once the best solution is selected, it is sent to the user for approval, then execution is verified and executed through a Verifier smart contract on NEAR.

Read the [docs](https://docs.near.org/chain-abstraction/intents/overview).

### [Stellar Wallet Sponsorship Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LgVMFRggdjBAxSpI4nxucUmbZIsnUbMPT8RJQ_rJ5k4/edit?gid=1771515065#gid=1771515065)

Estimates the XLM requirements for wallets looking to use sponsored reserves and fee-bump transactions to cover account creation, transaction fees, trustlines, and more.

### [Privy](https://docs.privy.io/wallets/overview/chains)
