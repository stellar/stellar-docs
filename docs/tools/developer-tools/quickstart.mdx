SDF maintains a quickstart Docker image that bundles Stellar Core with Horizon, RPC, Friendbot, and the necessary PostgreSQL databases. It provides a quick way to set up a node for development and testing. The image comes preconfigured for Mainnet, Testnet, Futurenet, or a Local network node. More details are available at the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart).

The Stellar CLI also provides commands to start, stop, and observe a quickstart node. For more information, see the [Stellar CLI documentation](cli/stellar-cli.mdx#stellar-network-container).

Please note: the quickstart image is not intended for production purposes. Information about setting up a production environment is available [here](../../validators/README.mdx).
