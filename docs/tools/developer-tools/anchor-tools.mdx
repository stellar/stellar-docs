# Anchor Tools

### [Anchor Directory](https://anchors.stellar.org/?)

View all anchors on Stellar, their currencies, and where they operate.

### [Demo Wallet](https://demo-wallet.stellar.org/)

An application for interactively testing anchor services. Lets financial application developers test their integrations and learn how Stellar ecosystem protocols (SEPs) work; use the demo wallet to test Regulated Assets (SEP-8), Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal (SEP-24), and Cross-Border Payments (SEP-31) with any home domain that has a Stellar Info File (also known as SEP-1, or a stellar.toml file).

### [Anchor Test Suite](https://anchor-tests.stellar.org/)

A test suite for validating SEP6, SEP24, SEP31 transfer servers.
