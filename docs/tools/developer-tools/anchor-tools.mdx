# Anchor Tools

### [Anchor Directory](https://anchors.stellar.org/?)

View all anchors on Stellar, their currencies, and where they operate.

### [Demo Wallet](https://demo-wallet.stellar.org/)

An application for interactively testing anchor services. Lets financial application developers test their integrations and learn how Stellar ecosystem protocols (SEPs) work; use the demo wallet to test Regulated Assets (SEP-8), Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal (SEP-24), and Cross-Border Payments (SEP-31) with any home domain that has a Stellar Info File (also known as SEP-1, or a stellar.toml file).

### [Polaris](https://django-polaris.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

An extendable django app that makes it easy for anchors to facilitate cross-border payments and enable deposits and withdrawals; run a web server supporting any combination of SEP-1, 6, 10, 12, and 24.
