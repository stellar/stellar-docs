### [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org)

Stellar Lab is our new go-to tool for development, experimenting, and testing, as well as exploring APIs developers use to interact with the Stellar network. Whether you're a developer seeking to test transactions, explore RPC methods or Horizon endpoints, or dive deeper into the ecosystem, Stellar Lab provides a modern and user-friendly interface that makes the process smooth and intuitive.

### Features of Stellar Lab

- Easily Create Accounts: Create Accounts on Mainnet, Testnet, and Futurenet using a web UI. You can use Friendbot to fund those accounts directly on Lab for Testnet and Futurenet.
- Access RPC Methods and Horizon Endpoints: Leverage powerful Stellar RPC methods and Stellar Horizon endpoints in a web UI to interact with the Stellar network and obtain crucial data. Try RPC methods to get states from the ledger like accounts, trustlines, contract wasm, and more.
- Simulate and Submit: Lab supports the ability to use custom RPC providers so that you could simulate transactions, save transactions, and submit transactions directly using Lab. You can also submit transactions using Horizon.
- Save and Share API Requests: Easily save your requests and transactions for the future or share them with teammates to build faster together.
- XDR ⇔ JSON Support: We have introduced a canonical [XDR to JSON mapping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/stellar-xdr-json-web) which is used on Stellar Lab (also used in the [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli)). You can see this at work in the Lab where [XDR can be converted to JSON](https://lab.stellar.org/xdr/view).
- Mobile Friendly: We heard that you use Lab on the mobile, so we optimized the Lab to have a mobile responsive layout.

These are the features that are available now. There will be more upcoming features to support smart contracts. We look forward to showing you the future of Stellar Lab.
