# Horizon Endpoint

Horizon provides an HTTP API to data stored in the Stellar network. This API serves the bridge between apps and Stellar Core. Stellar Lab's [API Explorer](https://lab.stellar.org/endpoints) provides Horizon Endpoint UI for developers to interact with Horizon on Futurenet, Testnet, Mainnet, and Custom network. Developers can use Stellar Lab to build and submit transactions, query an account balance, and stream events like transactions to an account.

:::info

On August 1, 2024, the SDF truncated historical data on its Horizon instances to one year. This update allows us to optimize performance and ensure a streamlined experience for all users. We encourage you to explore [third-party ecosystem providers of Horizon](../../../../data/horizon/horizon-providers), which may provide a longer history retention window as well as other features.

:::

Data on the Stellar ledger is organized according to [resources](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/resources): **Accounts, Assets, Claimable Balances, Effects, Ledgers, Liquidity Pools, Offers, Operations, Trades**, and **Transactions**. Each resource has several different endpoints. The endpoints that aggregate data about the ledger (also known as [aggregations](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/aggregations)) use the following resource: **Order Books, Paths, Trade Aggregations**, and **Fee Stats**.

Stellar Lab's horizon endpoint has each resource type listed in the side menu for developers to interact with its endpoint.

Let's go through a few examples of Horizon Endpoints — Accounts, Asset, Payment — using Testnet, Mainnet, and Custom Network.

For more information on each endpoint, click the **View Docs** link in the header. It'll redirect you to its endpoint's API Reference documentation.

## [[Accounts] Single Account](https://lab.stellar.org/endpoints/accounts/single)

The single account endpoint provides information on a specific account. The balances section in the response will also list all the trustlines this account has established, including trustlines that haven’t been authorized yet. I'm using an account that I created on Testnet `GBPIMUEJFYS7RT23QO2ACH2JMKGXLXZI4E5ACBSQMF32RKZ5H3SVNL5F` that has an XLM balance, USDC trustline, thresholds value, and 3 signers as an example.

Once I click the **Submit** button, the account endpoint returns my account details in `JSON` format. Developers can use the **Copy Json** functionality to copy and paste the response. In addition to the account details, the account endpoint also provides links for other resources' pages on the Stellar Lab related to the account that I inquired. For example, its response shows `transactions`, `operations`, `payments`, and etc under `_links`. For example, clicking transaction's `href` would take developers to [Transactions for Account page](https://lab.stellar.org/endpoints/transactions/account?$=network$id=testnet&label=Testnet&horizonUrl=https:////horizon-testnet.stellar.org&rpcUrl=https:////soroban-testnet.stellar.org&passphrase=Test%20SDF%20Network%20/;%20September%202015;&endpoints$params$account_id=GBPIMUEJFYS7RT23QO2ACH2JMKGXLXZI4E5ACBSQMF32RKZ5H3SVNL5F;;) on the Stellar Lab.
