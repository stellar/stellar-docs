To bring battle-tested smart contracts to the Stellar developer community, OpenZeppelin is activley contributing towards a library of smart contracts and extensions, as well as developer tooling.

## Getting Started with Contract Wizard

![Contract Wizard](/assets/openzeppelin-contract-wizard.png)

[OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/stellar) includes support for Stellar’s Rust-based smart contracts, making it easier for developers to generate and deploy secure, audited contracts.Developers can leverage pre-built contract templates for:

- Fungible Tokens (FTs)
- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Multi-Token Standard
- Security Token Standard
- RWA Token Standard
- Token Vault Standard
- And more coming soon

These implementations will be released throughout the year, ensuring that Stellar developers have access to secure and extensible contract options. All contracts and extensions are audited by OpenZeppelin’s security team, providing security and reliability.
