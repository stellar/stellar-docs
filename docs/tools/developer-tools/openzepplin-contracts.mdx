To bring battle-tested smart contracts to the Stellar developer community, OpenZeppelin is actively contributing towards a library of smart contracts and extensions, as well as developer tooling.

## Getting started with Contract Wizard

[OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/stellar) includes support for Stellar’s Rust-based smart contracts, making it easier for developers to generate and deploy secure, audited contracts. Try it out below or visit the wizard [here](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/stellar).

## OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts and Utilities

OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts is a collection of audited contracts and utilities for Stellar. The contracts are developed by OpenZeppelin in collaboration with the Stellar community and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), in an effort to bring a library of high-quality and audited contracts that can be used to build applications on the Stellar network.

Developers can leverage pre-built contract templates for:

- Fungible Tokens
- NonFungible Tokens
- Stablecoins

Including contract options like:

- Upgradeable Macros
- Allowlist/Blocklist
- Access Control Ownable/Roles

Ohter contracts on the roadmap include:

- Multi-Token Standard
- Security Token Standard
- RWA Token Standard
- Token Vault Standard
- And more coming soon

These implementations will be released over time, ensuring that Stellar developers have access to extensible contract options. All contracts and extensions are audited by OpenZeppelin’s security team, enhancing security and reliability of the contracts and extensions.

To use the library, please go to: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts.
