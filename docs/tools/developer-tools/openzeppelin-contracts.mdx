To bring battle-tested smart contracts to the Stellar developer community, OpenZeppelin is actively contributing towards a library of smart contracts and extensions, as well as developer tooling.

## Getting started with Contract Wizard

[OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/stellar) includes support for Stellar’s Rust-based smart contracts, making it easier for developers to generate and deploy secure, audited contracts. After you have selected your desired template and options you can download it as a single file, a Rust development package, or a [Scaffold Stellar Package](./scaffold-stellar). Try it out below or visit the wizard [here](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/stellar).
