# Data Indexers

To power your applications, a range of data services will be available from data indexers with query interfaces. These indexers will allow you to easily store and retrieve decoded ledger data, contract event emissions, and more. You can focus more energy on making your project successful, and waste less time figuring out precisely how to get the important data from the network.

### [SubQuery](https://subquery.network/)

An open-source data indexer that supports both Stellar and Soroban. SubQuery allows users to build a custom API for their dapp or smart contract and provides clean indexed data to any service. You can index ledgers, transactions, operations, and effects from Stellar and transactions and events from Soroban into your own Postgres database. Read the quick start guide here.

### [Mercury](https://mercurydata.app/)

A network indexing service that provides a toolkit to help get you started working with Stellar network data.

### [BlockEden](https://blockeden.xyz/stellar-soroban/)

An all-in-one Soroban RPC, indexer GraphQL API, and data analytics web portal.
