# Building with AI

Stellar provides resources to help AI assistants and Large Language Models (LLMs) understand our documentation, making it easier for you to get accurate answers about Stellar development.

## Stellar Development Skill

The [Stellar Development Skill](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill) is a comprehensive AI skill that gives coding assistants deep knowledge of the Stellar ecosystem. It follows the open [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) standard, making it compatible with multiple AI coding tools.

The skill provides expertise in:

- Soroban smart contracts (Rust SDK)
- JavaScript, Python, and Go SDKs for client applications
- Stellar RPC and Horizon APIs
- Stellar Assets and Soroban tokens (SAC bridge)
- Wallet integration (Freighter, Stellar Wallets Kit)
- Smart accounts with passkeys
- Testing strategies and security patterns

### Supported platforms

The skill can be installed on any AI coding tool that supports the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) standard:

| Platform | Skills directory |
| --- | --- |
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | `~/.config/opencode/skill/` |
| [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/) | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) | `~/.pi/agent/skills/` |

### Installation

**Claude Code:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add stellar/stellar-dev-skill
```

**Using npx (works with any compatible tool):**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill
```

**Manual installation:**

[Clone the repository](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill) and copy the `skill/` directory to your agent's skills location (see table above).

Once installed, your AI coding assistant will automatically have access to up-to-date Stellar development knowledge when you work on Stellar projects.

For other AI coding tools like Cursor, Windsurf, or Aider, you can consider the community-maintained [OpenSkills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) CLI, which aims to bring the Agent Skills system to a wide range of AI coding agents. OpenSkills is a third-party project and not an official Stellar offering, so be sure to review the repository and its documentation to verify that it meets your security and maintenance requirements before using it.

## Using llms.txt

[`llms.txt`](https://developers.stellar.org/llms.txt) is a standardized way to provide documentation context to AI systems. This file contains a structured overview of Stellar's developer documentation optimized for LLM consumption.

When you ask an AI assistant about Stellar, it can reference this file to:

- Understand the structure of our documentation
- Find relevant pages for your questions
- Provide more accurate, up-to-date answers

## Stella: Your Stellar AI Assistant

[Stella](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/ai-bot) is an AI assistant specifically trained on Stellar documentation, code examples, and community knowledge.

Stella can help you with:

- Smart contract development questions
- Understanding Stellar concepts
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Finding relevant documentation

You can chat with Stella right here by clicking the yellow icon at the bottom of this page, or join the `#stella-help` channel in the [Stellar Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev).

## Other AI tools

Any AI assistant with custom context features can benefit from Stellar's resources. You can add `llms.txt` to your tool's context settings, or paste its contents directly into conversations to give the AI knowledge about Stellar development.

Popular tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Cursor all support adding custom context through their settings. We're actively working on dedicated integrations for more AI tools—check back for updates or follow the [Stellar Development Skill repository](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill) for the latest supported platforms.
