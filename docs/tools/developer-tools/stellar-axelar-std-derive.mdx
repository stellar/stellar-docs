Axelar has created a Rust crate with useful macros for Stellar smart contract development. Please see Rust Crate [`stellar_axelar_std_derive`](https://axelarnetwork.github.io/axelar-amplifier-stellar/stellar_axelar_std_derive/index.html) for Attribute Macros and Derive Macros, and additional information.

Please note that in the future, some macros will be moved into Soroban Rust SDK.
