Axelar has created a Rust crate with useful macros for Stellar smart contract
development. Please see Rust Crate [`stellar_axelar_std_derive`](https://axelarnetwork.github.io/axelar-amplifier-stellar/stellar_axelar_std_derive/index.html) for Attribute Macros and Derive
Macros, and additional information. 

Please note that in the future, some macros will be moved into Soroban Rust SDK. 

Please note for `Pausible`, and `Upgradable`, we recommend using OpenZeppelin's fully
audited implementations here: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts.
