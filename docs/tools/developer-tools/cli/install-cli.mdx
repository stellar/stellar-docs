# Install the Stellar CLI

### Stellar CLI

There are a few ways to install the latest released version of Stellar CLI.

Install with Homebrew (macOS, Linux):

```text
brew install stellar-cli
```

Install with winget (Windows):

```text
winget install --id Stellar.StellarCLI
```

Install with cargo from source ([github.com/stellar/stellar-cli](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli)):

```text
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

:::note

You can also use the third-party tool [SVM (Stellar Version Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svm-cli), a version manager for Stellar CLI that allows you to install and switch between different versions of stellar-cli.

:::

Install in your GitHub action (this is a preferred option of installing cli in your GitHub actions)

```
- uses: stellar/stellar-cli
## Optionally specify version of the cli. If not provided, latest available version will be used
  with:
    version: 22.4.0
```

## Set up Autocomplete

The Stellar CLI supports some autocompletion. To set up, run the following commands:

```text
stellar completion --shell <SHELL>
```

Possible SHELL values are `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell`, `zsh`, etc.

To enable autocomplete in the current bash shell, run:

```text
source <(stellar completion --shell bash)
```

To enable autocomplete permanently, run:

```text
echo "source <(stellar completion --shell bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Stellar CLI Cookbook

Examples of recipes included in the CLI cookbook include: send payments, manage contract lifecycle, extend contract instance/storage/wasm, and more.
