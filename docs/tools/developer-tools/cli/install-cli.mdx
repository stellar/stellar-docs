# Install the Stellar CLI

### [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli)

There are a few ways to install the latest released version of Stellar CLI.

Install with Homebrew (macOS, Linux):

```sh
brew install stellar-cli
```

Install with cargo from source:

```sh
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

## Set up Autocomplete

The Stellar CLI supports some autocompletion. To set up, run the following commands:

```sh
stellar completion --shell <SHELL>
```

Possible SHELL values are `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell`, `zsh`, etc.

To enable autocomplete in the current bash shell, run:

```sh
source <(stellar completion --shell bash)
```

To enable autocomplete permanently, run:

```sh
echo "source <(stellar completion --shell bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```
