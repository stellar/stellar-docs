# Tools Overview

This section of the docs will provide links to the SDKs and developer tools for use when developing on Stellar as well as documentation for various SDF-maintained platforms such as the Anchor Platform and Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP).

## Developer Tools

### [SDKs](./sdks/README.mdx)

Stellar’s Software Development Kits (SDKs) provide devs with the tools, libraries, and documentation to interact with and develop on the blockchain. They simplify tasks such as creating and deploying smart contracts and sending transactions while also offering APIs to access data and integrate functionalities into applications.

### [Stellar CLI](./cli/README.mdx)

The command line interface to Soroban smart contracts. It allows you to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts; configure identities; generate key pairs; manage networks; and more.

### [Lab](./lab/README.mdx)

Stellar Lab is our new go-to tool for development, experimenting, and testing, as well as exploring APIs developers use to interact with the Stellar network.

### [Quickstart](./quickstart/README.mdx)

Quickstart is a local Stellar network environment (node) that allows developers to run a local version of the Stellar network for development and testing.

### [OpenZeppelin Relayer](./openzeppelin-relayer.mdx)

OpenZeppelin Relayer, also known as Stellar Channels Service, is a managed infrastructure for submitting Stellar Soroban transactions with automatic parallel processing and fee management. The service handles all the complexity of transaction submission, allowing you to focus on building your application.

### [OpenZeppelin Contracts](./openzeppelin-contracts.mdx)

OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts is a collection of audited contracts and utilities for Stellar. The contracts are developed by OpenZeppelin in collaboration with the Stellar community and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), in an effort to bring a library of high-quality and audited contracts that can be used to build applications on the Stellar network.

### [Scaffold Stellar](./scaffold-stellar.mdx)

Scaffold Stellar is a developer toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on Stellar. It provides CLI tools, reusable contract templates, a smart contract registry, and a modern frontend.

### [More Developer Tools](./developer-tools/README.mdx)

Find other SDF and ecosystem-maintained developer tools that help streamline the development process for applications and smart contracts on Stellar.

## SDF Platforms

### [Anchor Platform](../platforms/anchor-platform/README.mdx)

The Anchor Platform is a set of tools and APIs that enable developers and businesses to build their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network. It provides a standardized interface, including the implementation of several Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), to make it easy for businesses to integrate with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.

### [Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP)](../platforms/stellar-disbursement-platform/README.mdx)

The Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP) is a tool built for organizations to make bulk payments to a group of recipients over the Stellar network.
