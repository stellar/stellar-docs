This section of the docs will provide links to the SDKs and developer tools for use when developing on Stellar as well as documentation for various SDF-maintained platforms such as the Anchor Platform and Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP).

## [SDKs](./sdks/library.mdx) {#sdks}

Stellar’s Software Development Kits (SDKs) provide devs with the tools, libraries, and documentation to interact with and develop on the blockchain. They simplify tasks such as creating and deploying smart contracts and sending transactions while also offering APIs to access data and integrate functionalities into applications.

## [Developer Tools](./developer-tools/README.mdx) {#developer-tools}

Find SDF and ecosystem-maintained developer tools that help streamline the development process for applications and smart contracts on Stellar.

## SDF Platforms {#sdf-platforms}

### [Anchor Platform](/platforms/anchor-platform) {#anchor-platform}

The Anchor Platform is a set of tools and APIs that enable developers and businesses to build their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network. It provides a standardized interface, including the implementation of several Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), to make it easy for businesses to integrate with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.

### [Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP)](/platforms/stellar-disbursement-platform) {#stellar-disbursement-platform-sdp}

The Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP) is a tool built for organizations to make bulk payments to a group of recipients over the Stellar network.
