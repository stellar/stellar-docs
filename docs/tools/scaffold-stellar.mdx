**Scaffold Stellar** is a developer toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. It helps you go from idea to working full-stack dApp faster — by providing CLI tools, reusable contract templates, a smart contract registry, and a modern frontend.

Visit the [Scaffold Stellar](https://scaffoldstellar.org) homepage for guides, docs, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Description | Install Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) | For writing and compiling smart contracts | `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \| sh` |
| [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) | For frontend development | Download from official site |
| [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) | For building, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts | [`Link for the repo`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) |

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the required CLI tools:

```bash
# Install stellar-scaffold CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-scaffold-cli

# Install registry CLI (to easily deploy your contract to the registry)
cargo install --locked stellar-registry-cli
```

:::tip For a faster install, use cargo-binstall

Instead of building from source, you can speed up the installation by getting the binary directly using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall). This is especially useful in CI environments.

```bash
# Install cargo-binstall (see other install methods in their README linked above)
cargo install cargo-binstall

# Install the binaries
cargo binstall stellar-scaffold-cli stellar-registry-cli
```

:::

### Creating a New Project

1. Initialize a new project:

```bash
stellar scaffold init my-project
cd my-project
```

This will create the project scaffold in the directory you specified with a few sample contracts. Or you can start from the [OpenZeppelin Wizard](./openzeppelin-contracts) to customize your contract and start a Scaffold Stellar project from there.

2. Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

You'll have a running dApp integrated with the starter contracts, ready to start building!

Explore the `environments.toml` file to customize your development environment(s) that's set by your `.env` file.

## Project Structure

When you run `stellar scaffold init`, it creates a full-stack project structure with example contracts and a modern frontend:

```
my-project/
├── contracts/          # Rust smart contracts (compiled to WASM)
├── packages/           # Auto-generated TypeScript contract clients
├── src/                # React frontend code
│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── contracts/      # Contract interaction logic
│   ├── App.tsx         # Main app component
│   └── main.tsx        # Entry point
├── environments.toml   # Configuration per environment (dev/test/prod)
├── .env                # Local environment variables
├── package.json        # Frontend packages
└── target/             # Build outputs
```

This template provides a ready-to-use frontend application with example smart contracts and their TypeScript clients. The frontend is set up with `Vite`, `React`, and includes basic components for interacting with the contracts.

## Features

- **CLI Plugins for Stellar**
  - `stellar scaffold init`: Initialize new Stellar smart contract projects
  - `stellar scaffold upgrade`: Transform existing Stellar contract workspaces into Scaffold projects
  - `stellar scaffold build`: Build contracts and generate TypeScript clients
  - `stellar scaffold watch`: Development mode with hot reloading
  - `stellar registry`: Publish, deploy, and manage smart contracts

- **Environment Management**
  - Environment-specific builds (development, testing, staging, production)
  - Seamless integration with both local and deployed contracts
  - Network configuration via `environments.toml`
  - Support for multiple deployment environments

- **Smart Contract Registry**
  - On-chain publishing platform for Wasm binaries
  - Version management and contract naming
  - Contract verification and dependency management
  - Secure deployment workflow for testnet and mainnet
