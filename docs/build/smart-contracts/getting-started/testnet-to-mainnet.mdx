## Moving a Contract from Testnet to Mainnet

This guide outlines the process for securely deploying Soroban smart contracts from testnet to mainnet using GitHub Actions and Github Attestation for source code validation.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Set Up Contract Source Validation

- Configure your GitHub repository for automated source validation.
- Create a workflow file `.github/workflows/release.yml` in your repository.

Example workflow:

```yaml
name: Build and Release # arbitrary name
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*" # triggered whenever a new tag (prefixed with "v") is pushed

permissions: # required permissions
  id-token: write
  contents: write
  attestations: write

jobs:
  release-contract-a:
    uses: stellar-expert/soroban-build-workflow/.github/workflows/release.yml@main
    with:
      release_name: ${{ github.ref_name }} # git tag as unique release name
      release_description: "Contract release" # text to attach to the release
      relative_path: '["src/my-awesome-contract"]' # relative contract path
      package: "my-awesome-contract" # package name to build
      make_target: "build-dependencies" # make target to invoke
    secrets: # authentication tokens will be automatically created by GitHub
      release_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # don't modify this line
```

### 2. Compile and Validate Contract

- Trigger the workflow by pushing a new tag (e.g., `v1.0`).
- The workflow will:
  - Compile the contract to WASM.
  - Publish a GitHub release with build artifacts.
  - Generate a GitHub attestation, linking the WASM to the source code.

```bash
    stellar contract build \
        --meta name="Contract Name"  \
        --meta description="Descripton of the contract"
        --meta source="https://api.github.com/repos/<user_name>/<repo_name>"
```

### 3. Deploy to Mainnet

- Retrieve the compiled WASM from the GitHub release.
- Deploy the WASM to the Stellar mainnet using the Soroban CLI:

```bash
  stellar contract deploy --source-acount <source-account> --wasm <path-to-wasm> --network mainnet
```

### 4. Verify Contract Authenticity

Use the GitHub API to confirm the WASM's source: Retrieve attestation via: `https://api.github.com/repos/<user_name>/<repo_name>/attestations/sha256:<wasm_hash>` Ensure the source code and commit hash match the deployed contract.
