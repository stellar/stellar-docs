# 2. Deploy to Testnet

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import { getPlatform } from "@site/src/helpers/getPlatform";

To recap what we've done so far, in [Setup](setup.mdx):

- we set up our local environment to write Rust smart contracts
- installed the stellar-cli
- configured the stellar-cli to communicate with the Stellar Testnet via RPC
- and configured an identity to sign transactions

In [Hello World](./hello-world.mdx) we created a `hello-world` project, and learned how to test and build the `HelloWorld` contract. Now we are ready to deploy that contract to Testnet, and interact with it.

## Configure a Source Account

When you deploy a smart contract to a network, you need to specify a source account's keypair that will be used to sign the transactions.

Let's generate a keypair called `alice`. You can use any name you want, but it might be nice to have some named keys that you can use for testing, such as [`alice`, `bob`, and `carol`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob). Notice that the keypair's account will be funded using [Friendbot](../../../networks/README.mdx#friendbot).

```sh
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund
```

You can see the public key of `alice` with:

```sh
stellar keys address alice
```

You can see all of the keys you generated, along with where on your filesystem their information is stored, with:

```sh
stellar keys ls -l
```

## Deploy

To deploy your HelloWorld contract, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/hello_world.wasm \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  --alias hello_world
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract deploy `
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/hello_world.wasm `
  --source-account alice `
  --network testnet `
  --alias hello_world
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This returns the contract's id, starting with a `C`. In this example, we're going to use `CACDYF3CYMJEJTIVFESQYZTN67GO2R5D5IUABTCUG3HXQSRXCSOROBAN`, so replace it with your actual contract id.

:::tip

We used the `--alias` flag in this deploy command which will create a `~/.config/stellar/contract-ids/hello_world.json` file that maps the alias `hello_world` to the contract id and network. This allows us to refer to this contract as its alias instead the contract id.

:::

## Interact

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract](./hello-world.mdx#contract-source-code) and the resulting `.wasm` file we built in [Build](hello-world.mdx#build-the-contract), run the following command to invoke the `hello` function.

:::info

In the background, the CLI is making RPC calls. For information on that checkout out the [RPC](../../../data/apis/rpc/admin-guide/README.mdx) reference page.

:::

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CACDYF3CYMJEJTIVFESQYZTN67GO2R5D5IUABTCUG3HXQSRXCSOROBAN \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  hello \
  --to RPC
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract invoke `
  --id CACDYF3CYMJEJTIVFESQYZTN67GO2R5D5IUABTCUG3HXQSRXCSOROBAN `
  --source-account alice `
  --network testnet `
  -- `
  hello `
  --to RPC
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello", "RPC"]
```

:::info

The `--` double-dash is required!

This is a general [CLI pattern](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11376/what-does-double-dash-mean) used by other commands like [cargo run](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html). Everything after the `--`, sometimes called [slop](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/971), is passed to a child process. In this case, `stellar contract invoke` builds an _implicit CLI_ on-the-fly for the `hello` method in your contract. It can do this because Soroban SDK embeds your contract's schema / interface types right in the `.wasm` file that gets deployed on-chain. You can also try:

```sh
stellar contract invoke ... -- --help
```

and

```sh
stellar contract invoke ... -- hello --help
```

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to:

- deploy a contract to Testnet
- interact with a deployed contract

Next we'll add a new contract to this project, and see how our workspace can accommodate a multi-contract project. The new contract will show off a little bit of Soroban's storage capabilities.
