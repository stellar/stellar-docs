# 4. Deploy the Increment Contract

## Two-step deployment

It's worth knowing that `deploy` is actually a two-step process.

1. **Upload the contract bytes to the network.** Soroban currently refers to this as _installing_ the contract—from the perspective of the blockchain itself, this is a reasonable metaphor. This uploads the bytes of the contract to the network, indexing it by its hash. This contract code can now be referenced by multiple contracts, which means they would have the exact same _behavior_ but separate storage state.

2. **Instantiate the contract.** This actually creates what you probably think of as a Smart Contract. It makes a new contract ID, and associates it with the contract bytes that were uploaded in the previous step.

You can run these two steps separately. Let's try it with the Increment contract:

:::info

If the contract has not been build yet, run the build command `stellar contract build` from the contract's root directory.

:::

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar contract upload \
  --network testnet \
  --source-account alice \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract upload `
  --network testnet `
  --source-account alice `
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This returns the hash of the Wasm bytes, like `6ddb28e0980f643bb97350f7e3bacb0ff1fe74d846c6d4f2c625e766210fbb5b`. Now you can use `--wasm-hash` with `deploy` rather than `--wasm. Make sure to replace the example wasm hash with your own.

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash 6ddb28e0980f643bb97350f7e3bacb0ff1fe74d846c6d4f2c625e766210fbb5b \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  --alias increment
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract deploy `
  --wasm-hash 6ddb28e0980f643bb97350f7e3bacb0ff1fe74d846c6d4f2c625e766210fbb5b `
  --source-account alice `
  --network testnet `
  --alias increment
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This command will return the contract id (e.g. `CACDYF3CYMJEJTIVFESQYZTN67GO2R5D5IUABTCUG3HXQSRXCSOROBAN`), and you can use it to invoke the contract like we did in previous examples.

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CACDYF3CYMJEJTIVFESQYZTN67GO2R5D5IUABTCUG3HXQSRXCSOROBAN \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  increment
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract invoke `
  --id CACDYF3CYMJEJTIVFESQYZTN67GO2R5D5IUABTCUG3HXQSRXCSOROBAN `
  --source-account alice `
  --network testnet `
  -- `
  increment
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You should see the following output:

```sh
1
```

Run it a few more times to watch the count change.

## Run your own network/node

Sometimes you'll need to run your own node:

- Production apps! Stellar maintains public test RPC nodes for Testnet and Futurenet, but not for Mainnet. Instead, you will need to run your own node, and point your app at that. If you want to use a software-as-a-service platform for this, [various providers](../../../data/apis/api-providers.mdx) are available.
- When you need a network that differs from the version deployed to Testnet.

The RPC team maintains Docker containers that make this as straightforward as possible. See the [RPC](../../../data/apis/rpc/admin-guide/README.mdx) reference for details.
