Stellar smart contracts are small programs written in the [Rust] programming language.

To build and develop contracts you need only a couple prerequisites:

- A [Rust] toolchain
- An editor that supports Rust
- [Stellar CLI]

## Install Rust

### Linux, macOS, or other Unix-like OS

If you use macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, the simplest method to install a Rust toolchain is to install `rustup`. Install `rustup` with the following command.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Windows

On Windows, download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe). You can continue with the default settings by pressing Enter.

:::tip

The Stellar CLI uses emojis in its output. To properly render them on Windows, it is recommended to use the [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/). See [how to install Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) on Microsoft Learn. If the CLI is used in the built in Windows Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell the CLI will function as expected but the emojis will appear as question marks.

:::

If you're already using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), you can also follow the instructions for Linux.

### Other

For other methods of installing [Rust], see: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Install the target

Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Configure an Editor

Many editors have support for Rust. Visit the following link to find out how to configure your editor: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools

A popular editor is Visual Studio Code:

- [Visual Studio Code] editor.
- [Rust Analyzer] for Rust language support.
- [CodeLLDB] for step-through-debugging.

[rust analyzer]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer
[codelldb]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb

## Install the Stellar CLI

The [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) can execute smart contracts on futurenet, testnet, mainnet, as well as in a local sandbox.

### Install

There are a few ways to install the [latest released version](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/releases) of Stellar CLI.

Install with Homebrew (macOS, Linux):

```sh
brew install stellar-cli
```

Install with cargo from source:

```sh
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

### Documentation

The auto-generated comprehensive reference documentation is available [here](../../../tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli.mdx).

### Autocompletion

You can use `stellar completion` to generate shell completion for `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell`, and `zsh`. You should absolutely try it out. It will feel like a super power!

To enable autocomplete in the current bash shell, run:

```sh
source <(stellar completion --shell bash)
```

To enable autocomplete permanently in future bash shells, run:

```sh
echo "source <(stellar completion --shell bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Users of non-bash shells may need to adapt the above commands to suit their needs.

### Configuring the CLI for Testnet

Stellar has a test network called Testnet that you can use to deploy and test your smart contracts. It's a live network, but it's not the same as the Stellar public network. It's a separate network that is used for development and testing, so you can't use it for production apps. But it's a great place to test your contracts before you deploy them to the public network.

To configure your CLI to interact with Testnet, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar network add \
  --global testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar network add `
  --global testnet `
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 `
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Note the `--global` flag. This creates a file in your home folder's `~/.config/soroban/network/testnet.toml` with the settings you specified. This means that you can use the `--network testnet` flag in any Stellar CLI command to use this network from any directory or filepath on your system.

If you want project-specific network configurations, you can omit the `--global` flag, and the networks will be added to your working directory's `.soroban/network` folder instead.

### Configure an Identity

When you deploy a smart contract to a network, you need to specify an identity that will be used to sign the transactions.

Let's configure an identity called `alice`. You can use any name you want, but it might be nice to have some named identities that you can use for testing, such as [`alice`, `bob`, and `carol`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob).

```sh
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet
```

You can see the public key of `alice` with:

```sh
stellar keys address alice
```

Like the Network configs, the `--global` means that the identity gets stored in `~/.config/soroban/identity/alice.toml`. You can omit the `--global` flag to store the identity in your project's `.soroban/identity` folder instead.

By default, `stellar keys generate` will fund the account using [Friendbot](../../../learn/fundamentals/networks.mdx#friendbot). To disable this behavior, append `--no-fund` to the command when running it.
