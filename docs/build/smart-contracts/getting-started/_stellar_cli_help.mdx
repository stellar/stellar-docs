$ stellar --help
Build, deploy, & interact with contracts; set identities to sign with; configure networks; generate keys; and more.

CLI Full Help Docs: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/tree/main/FULL_HELP_DOCS.md

The easiest way to get started is to generate a new identity:

    stellar keys generate alice

You can use identities with the `--source` flag in other commands later.

Commands that relate to smart contract interactions are organized under the `contract` subcommand. List them:

    stellar contract --help

A Soroban contract has its interface schema types embedded in the binary that gets deployed on-chain, making it possible to dynamically generate a custom CLI for each. The invoke subcommand makes use of this:

    stellar contract invoke --id CCR6QKTWZQYW6YUJ7UP7XXZRLWQPFRV6SWBLQS4ZQOSAF4BOUD77OTE2 --source alice --network testnet -- --help

Anything after the `--` double dash (the "slop") is parsed as arguments to the contract-specific CLI, generated on-the-fly from the embedded schema. For the hello world example, with a function called `hello` that takes one string argument `to`, here's how you invoke it:

    stellar contract invoke --id CCR6QKTWZQYW6YUJ7UP7XXZRLWQPFRV6SWBLQS4ZQOSAF4BOUD77OTE2 --source alice --network testnet -- hello --to world
