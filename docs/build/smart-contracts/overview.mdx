# Overview

Soroban is the smart contracts platform on the Stellar network. These contracts are small programs written in the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and compiled as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (Wasm) for deployment.

:::note

For a comprehensive introduction to Stellar smart contracts, view the [Smart Contract Learn Section](../../learn/fundamentals/contract-development/overview.mdx).

:::

Write your first smart contract on Stellar using the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/setup.mdx).

## Rust on Stellar

Stellar smart contracts have several characteristics (such as resource limits, security considerations, and more) that force contracts to use only a narrow subset of the full Rust language and must use specialized libraries for most tasks.

Learn more in the [Contract Rust Dialect section](../../learn/fundamentals/contract-development/rust-dialect.mdx).

In particular, the Rust standard library and most third-party libraries (called [crates](../../learn/migrate/evm/solidity-and-rust-advanced-concepts#crates)) will not be available for direct off-the-shelf use in contracts due to the abovementioned constraints. Some crates can be adapted for use in contracts, and others may be incorporated into the host environment as host objects or functions.

:::note

Other languages may be supported in the future, but at this time, only Rust is supported.

## Soroban Rust SDK

Contracts are developed using a software development kit (SDK). The [Soroban Rust SDK](../../tools/sdks/contract-sdks.mdx#soroban-rust-sdk) consists of a Rust crate and a command-line (CLI) tool.

The SDK crate acts as a substitute for the Rust standard library — providing data structures and utility functions for contracts — as well as providing access to smart-contract-specific functionality from the contract environment, like cryptographic hashing and signature verification, access to on-chain persistent storage, and location and invocation of secondary contracts via stable identifiers.

The Soroban SDK CLI tool provides a developer-focused front-end for:

- Compiling
- Testing
- Inspecting
- Versioning
- Deploying

It also includes a complete implementation of the contract host environment that is identical to the one that runs on-chain, called [local testing mode](../../learn/fundamentals/contract-development/errors-and-debugging/debugging.mdx#local-testing-mode). With this capability, contracts can be run locally on a developer's workstation and can be tested and debugged directly with a local debugger within a standard IDE, as well as a native test harness for fast-feedback unit testing and high-speed fuzzing or property testing.

## Host environment

The host environment is a set of Rust crates compiled into the SDK CLI tool and stellar-core. It comprises a set of host objects and functions, an interface to on-chain storage and contract invocation, a resource-accounting and fee-charging system, and a Wasm interpreter.

Most contract developers will not frequently need to interact with the host environment directly — SDK functions wrap most of its facilities and provide richer and more ergonomic types and functions — but it is helpful to understand its structure to understand the conceptual model the SDK is presenting. Some parts of the host environment will likely be visible when testing or debugging contracts compiled natively on a local workstation.

## Stellar smart contract FAQs

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<details>
  <summary>
   **What is Soroban to Stellar? Is it a new blockchain?​**
  </summary>
  Soroban is not a new blockchain. Soroban is a smart contract platform
  integrated into the existing Stellar blockchain. It is an additive feature
  that lives alongside and doesn't replace the existing set of Stellar
  operations.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
   **How do I invoke a Soroban contract on Stellar?​**
  </summary>
  Invoke a Soroban contract by submitting a transaction that contains the new
  operation:
  [`InvokeHostFunctionOp`](../../learn/fundamentals/transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#invoke-host-function).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    **Can Soroban contracts use Stellar accounts for authentication?​**
  </summary>
  Yes. Stellar accounts are shared with Soroban. Smart contacts have access to
  Stellar account signer configuration and know the source account that directly
  invoked them in a transaction. Check out the [Authorization
  section](../../learn/fundamentals/contract-development/authorization.mdx) for more
  information.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
   **Can Soroban contracts interact with Stellar assets?​**
  </summary>
  Yes. Soroban contains a built-in [Stellar Asset
  Contract](../../tokens/stellar-asset-contract.mdx) that can interact with
  classic trustlines.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    **Do issuers of Stellar assets maintain authorization over an asset sent to
    a non-account identifier in Soroban (`AUTH_REQUIRED`, `AUTH_REVOCABLE`,
    `AUTH_CLAWBACK`)​?**
  </summary>
  Yes. Issuers retain the same level of control on Soroban as they have
  regularly. This functionality is accessible through a set of admin functions
  (clawback, set_auth) on the built-in Stellar Asset Contract.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    **Can Soroban contracts interact with any other Stellar operations?​**
  </summary>
  No. Aside from the interactions with accounts and assets mentioned above. This
  means that Soroban contracts cannot interact with the SDEX, claimable
  balances, or sponsorships.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    **Does the Stellar base reserve apply to Soroban contracts?​**
  </summary>
  No. Soroban has a different [fee
  structure](../../learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering.mdx), and
  ledger entries that are allocated by Soroban contracts do not add to an
  account's required minimal balance.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
   **Need help finding what you're looking for?​**
  </summary>
  Ask in the Developer channels in the [Stellar Developer
  Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    **Should I issue my token as a Stellar asset or a Soroban contract token?​**
  </summary>
  To the greatest extent possible, we recommend issuing tokens as Stellar
  assets. These tokens will benefit from being interoperable with the existing
  tools available in the Stellar ecosystem and are more performant because the
  Stellar Asset Contract is built into the host. Read more in the [Tokens
  Overview](../../tokens/README.mdx).
