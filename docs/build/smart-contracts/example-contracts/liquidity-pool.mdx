The [liquidity pool example] demonstrates how to write a constant product liquidity pool contract. A liquidity pool is an automated way to add liquidity for a set of tokens that will facilitate asset conversion between them. Users can deposit some amount of each token into the pool, receiving a proportional number of "token shares." The user will then receive a portion of the accrued conversion fees when they ultimately "trade in" their token shares to receive their original tokens back.

Soroban liquidity pools are exclusive to Soroban and cannot interact with built-in Stellar AMM liquidity pools.

:::caution

Implementing a custom liquidity pool should be done cautiously. User funds are involved, so great care should be taken to ensure safety and transparency. The example here should _not_ be considered a ready-to-go contract. Please use it as a reference only.

The Stellar network already has liquidity pool functionality built right in to the core protocol. [Learn more here](../../../learn/encyclopedia/sdex/liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools.mdx).

[liquidity pool example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v22.0.1/liquidity_pool
[source code]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/v22.0.1/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs#L143

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `v22.0.1` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

```sh
git clone -b v22.0.1 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `liquidity_pool` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```sh
cd liquidity_pool
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```sh
running 3 tests
test test::deposit_amount_zero_should_panic - should panic ... ok
test test::swap_reserve_one_nonzero_other_zero - should panic ... ok
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

:::info

Since our liquidity pool will be issuing its own token to establish the nuber of shares in the pool the address has, we have created a `token.rs` module in this project to hold the logic controlling the token contract for those shares.

## How it Works

Every asset created on Stellar starts with zero liquidity. The same is true of tokens created on Soroban (unless a Stellar asset with existing liquidity token is "wrapped" for use in Soroban). In simple terms, "liquidity" means how much of an asset in a market is available to be bough or sold. In the "old days," you could generate liquidity in a market by creating buy/sell orders on an order book.

Liquidity pools automate this process by substituting the orders with math. Depositors into the liquidity pool earn fees from `swap` transactions. No orders required!

Open the `liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs` file or see the code above to follow along.

### Initialize the Contract

When this contract is deployed, the constructor will automatically be called, so the following arguments must be passed int:

- **`token_wasm_hash`:** The contract will end up [creating its own `POOL` token] as well as [interacting with contracts for `token_a` and `token_b`]. The way this example works is by using the [`token` example contract] for both of these jobs. When our liquidity pool contract is initialized it wants us to pass the wasm hash of the **already installed** token contract. It will then deploy a contract that will run the WASM bytecode stored at that hash as a new token contract for the `POOL` tokens.
- **`token_a`:** The contract `Address` for an **already deployed** (or wrapped) token that will be held in reserve by the liquidity pool.
- **`token_b`:** The contract `Address` for an **already deployed** (or wrapped) token that will be held in reserve by the liquidity pool.

Bear in mind that which token is `token_a` and which is `token_b` is **not** an arbitrary distinction. In line with the Built-in Stellar liquidity pools, this contract can only make a single liquidity pool for a given set of tokens. So, the token addresses must be provided in [lexicographical order] at the time of initialization.

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs
pub fn __constructor(e: Env, token_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>, token_a: Address, token_b: Address) {
    if token_a >= token_b {
        panic!("token_a must be less than token_b");
    }

    let share_contract = create_share_token(&e, token_wasm_hash, &token_a, &token_b);

    put_token_a(&e, token_a);
    put_token_b(&e, token_b);
    put_token_share(&e, share_contract);
    put_total_shares(&e, 0);
    put_reserve_a(&e, 0);
    put_reserve_b(&e, 0);
}
```

### A "Constant Product" Liquidity Pool

The _type_ of liquidity pool this example contract implements is called a "constant product" liquidity pool. While this isn't the only type of liquidity pool out there, it is the most common variety. These liquidity pools are designed to keep the _total_ value of each asset in _relative_ equilibrium. The "product" in the constant product (also called an "invariant") will change every time the liquidity pool is interacted with (deposit, withdraw, or token swaps). However, the invariant **must** only increase with every interaction.

During a swap, what must be kept in mind is that for every withdrawal from the `token_a` side, you must "refill" the `token_b` side with a sufficient amount to keep the liquidity pool's price balanced. The math is predictable, but it is not linear. The more you take from one side, the more you must give on the opposite site _exponentially_.

Inside the `swap` function, the math is done like this (this is a simplified version, however):

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs
fn swap(e: Env, to: Address, buy_a: bool, out: i128, in_max: i128) {
    // Get the current balances of both tokens in the liquidity pool
    let (reserve_sell, reserve_buy) = (get_reserve_a(&e), get_reserve_b(&e));

    // Calculate how much needs to be
    let n = reserve_sell * out * 1000;
    let d = (reserve_buy - out) * 997;
    let sell_amount = (n / d) + 1;
}
```

We have much more in-depth information about how this kind of liquidity pool works is available in [Stellar Quest: Series 3, Quest 5]. This is a really useful, interactive way to learn more about how the built-in Stellar liquidity pools work. Much of the knowledge you might gain from there will easily translate to this example contract.

[stellar quest: series 3, quest 5]: https://quest.stellar.org/learn/series/3/quest/5

### Interacting with Token Contracts in Another Contract

This liquidity pool contract will operate with a total of three different Soroban tokens:

- **`POOL`:** This token is a unique token that is given to asset depositors in exchange for their deposit. These tokens are "traded in" by the user when they withdraw some amount of their original deposit (plus any earned swap fees). This example contract implements the same [`token` example contract] for this token.
- **`token_a`** and **`token_b`**: Will be the two "reserve tokens" that users will deposit into the pool. These could be "wrapped" tokens from pre-existing Stellar assets, or they could be Soroban-native tokens. This contract doesn't really care, as long as the functions it needs from the common [Token Interface] are available in the token contract.

[token interface]: ../../../tokens/token-interface.mdx

#### Creating a Custom `POOL` Token for LP Shares

We are utilizing the compiled `token` example contract as our asset contract for the `POOL` token. This means it follows all the conventions of the [Token Interface], and can be treated just like any other token. They could be transferred, burned, minted, etc. It also means the LP developer _could_ take advantage of the administrative features such as clawbacks, authorization, and more.

The `token.rs` file contains a `create_share_token` function that we will use to deploy this particular token contract.

```rust title="src/token.rs"
pub fn create_share_token(
    e: &Env,
    token_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>,
    token_a: &Address,
    token_b: &Address,
) -> Address {
    let mut salt = Bytes::new(e);
    salt.append(&token_a.to_xdr(e));
    salt.append(&token_b.to_xdr(e));
    let salt = e.crypto().sha256(&salt);
    e.deployer().with_current_contract(salt).deploy_v2(
        token_wasm_hash,
        (
            e.current_contract_address(),
            7u32,
            String::from_val(e, &"Pool Share Token"),
            String::from_val(e, &"POOL"),
        ),
    )
}
```

Then, during a `deposit`, a calculated amount of `POOL` tokens are `mint`ed to the depositing address.

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs
fn mint_shares(e: &Env, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    let total = get_total_shares(e);
    let share_contract_id = get_token_share(e);

    token::Client::new(e, &share_contract_id).mint(&to, &amount);

    put_total_shares(e, total + amount);
}
```

How is that number of shares calculated, you ask? Excellent question! If it's the very first deposit (see above), it's just the square root of the product of the quantities of `token_a` and `token_b` deposited. Very simple.

However, if there have already been deposits into the liquidity pool, and the user is just adding more tokens into the pool, there's a bit more math. However, the main point is that each depositor receives the same ratio of `POOL` tokens for their deposit as every other depositor.

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs
fn deposit(e: Env, to: Address, desired_a: i128, min_a: i128, desired_b: i128, min_b: i128) {
    let zero = 0;
    let new_total_shares = if reserve_a > zero && reserve_b > zero {
        // Note balance_a and balance_b at this point in the function include
        // the tokens the user is currently depositing, whereas reserve_a and
        // reserve_b do not yet.
        let shares_a = (balance_a * total_shares) / reserve_a;
        let shares_b = (balance_b * total_shares) / reserve_b;
        shares_a.min(shares_b)
    } else {
        (balance_a * balance_b).sqrt()
    };
}
```

#### Token Transfers to/from the LP Contract

As we've already discussed, the liquidity pool contract will make use of the [Token Interface] available in the token contracts that were supplied as `token_a` and `token_b` arguments at the time of initialization. Throughout the rest of the contract, the liquidity pool will make use of that interface to make transfers of those tokens to/from itself.

What's happening is that as a user deposits tokens into the pool, and the contract invokes the `transfer` function to move the tokens from the `to` address (the depositor) to be held by the contract address. `POOL` tokens are then minted to depositor (see previous section). Pretty simple, right!?

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs
fn deposit(e: Env, to: Address, desired_a: i128, min_a: i128, desired_b: i128, min_b: i128) {
    // Depositor needs to authorize the deposit
    to.require_auth();

    let token_a_client = token::Client::new(&e, &get_token_a(&e));
    let token_b_client = token::Client::new(&e, &get_token_b(&e));

    token_a_client.transfer(&to, &e.current_contract_address(), &amounts.0);
    token_b_client.transfer(&to, &e.current_contract_address(), &amounts.1);

    mint_shares(&e, to, new_total_shares - total_shares);
}
```

In contrast, when a user withdraws their deposited tokens, It's about more involved, and the following procedure happens.

1. Some amount of the `POOL` token is transferred from the depositor to the contract address. This is a temporary way to track how many `POOL` tokens are being redeemed. The contract will not hold this balance of `POOL` for long.
2. The withdraw amounts for the reserve tokens are calculated based on the contract's current balance of `POOL` tokens.
3. The `POOL` tokens are burned now that the withdraw amounts have been calculated, and they are no longer needed.
4. The respective amounts of `token_a` and `token_b` are transferred _from_ the contract address into the `to` address (the depositor).

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs
fn withdraw(e: Env, to: Address, share_amount: i128, min_a: i128, min_b: i128) -> (i128, i128) {
    to.require_auth();

    // First transfer the pool shares that need to be redeemed
    let share_token_client = token::Client::new(&e, &get_token_share(&e));
    share_token_client.transfer(&to, &e.current_contract_address(), &share_amount);

    // Now calculate the withdraw amounts
    let out_a = (balance_a * balance_shares) / total_shares;
    let out_b = (balance_b * balance_shares) / total_shares;

    burn_shares(&e, balance_shares);
    transfer_a(&e, to.clone(), out_a);
    transfer_b(&e, to, out_b);
}
```

You'll notice that by holding the balance of `token_a` and `token_b` on the liquidity pool contract itself it makes, it very easy for us to perform any of the [Token Interface] actions inside the contract. As a bonus, any outside observer could query the balances of `token_a` or `token_b` held by the contract to verify the reserves are actually in line with the values the contract reports when its own `get_rsvs` function is invoked.

[`liquidity_pool/src/test.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/v22.0.1/liquidity_pool/src/test.rs

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/test.rs
let e = Env::default();
```

We mock authentication checks in the tests, which allows the tests to proceed as if all users/addresses/contracts/etc. had successfully authenticated.

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/test.rs
e.mock_all_auths();
```

We have abstracted into a few functions the tasks of creating token contracts, deploying a liquidity pool contract, and installing the token example WASM bytecode into our test environment. Each are then used within the test.

```rust title=liquidity_pool/src/test.rs
fn create_token_contract<'a>(e: &Env, admin: &Address) -> token::Client<'a> {
    token::Client::new(
        e,
        &e.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2(admin.clone())
            .address(),
    )
}

fn create_liqpool_contract<'a>(
    e: &Env,
    token_wasm_hash: &BytesN<32>,
    token_a: &Address,
    token_b: &Address,
) -> LiquidityPoolClient<'a> {
    LiquidityPoolClient::new(
        e,
        &e.register(
            crate::LiquidityPool {},
            (token_wasm_hash.clone(), token_a, token_b),
        ),
    )
}

fn install_token_wasm(e: &Env) -> BytesN<32> {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../token/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm"
    );
    e.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(WASM)
}
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the `#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is `LiquidityPool`, and the client is named `LiquidityPoolClient`.

These tests examine the "typical" use-case of a liquidity pool, ensuring that the balances, returns, etc. are appropriate at various points during the test.

1. First, the test sets everything up with an `Env`, two admin addresses, two reserve tokens, a randomly generated address to act as the user of the liquidity pool, the liquidity pool itself, a pool token shares contract, and mints the reserve assets to the user address.
2. The user then deposits some of each asset into the liquidity pool. At this time, the following checks are done:
   - appropriate authorizations for deposits and transfers exist,
   - balances are checked for each token (`token_a`, `token_b`, and `POOL`) from both the user's perspective and the `liqpool` contract's perspective
3. The user performs a swap, buying `token_b` in exchange for `token_a`. The same checks as the previous step are made now, excepting the balances of `POOL`, since a swap has no effect on `POOL` tokens.
4. The user then withdraws all of the deposits it made, trading all of its `POOL` tokens in the process. The same checks are made here as were made in the `deposit` step.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `stellar contract build` command.

```sh
stellar contract build
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```sh
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_liquidity_pool_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`stellar-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions using it.
