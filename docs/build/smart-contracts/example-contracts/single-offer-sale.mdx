The [single offer sale example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/single_offer) demonstrates how to write a contract that allows a seller to set up an offer to sell token A for token B to multiple buyers. The comments in the [source code](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/single_offer/src/lib.rs) explain how the contract should be used.
