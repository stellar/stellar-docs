The [mint-lock example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/mint-lock) demonstrates how to write a contract that can delegate minting tokens from another address with limits on how much those addresses can mint across a specified time period.

The admin of the token contracts used must be the mint-lock contract.
