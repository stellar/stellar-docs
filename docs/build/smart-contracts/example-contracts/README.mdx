# Example Contracts

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

The Stellar team has put together a large collection of [example contracts] to demonstrate use of smart contracts on Stellar. For many of these example contracts, we've written an accompanying tutorial that will walk you through the example contract and describe a bit more about its design.

The examples listed below are provided in a sequential manner. The first listed example contracts create a solid foundation of concepts that will be required during the later examples. While you are absolutely free to choose, read, and use any of the example contracts you like, please keep in mind that the order you see is intentional.
