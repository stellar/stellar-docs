The [atomic swap batching example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/atomic_multiswap) swaps a pair of tokens between the two groups of users that authorized the `swap` operation from the [Atomic Swap](atomic-swap.mdx) example.

This contract basically batches the multiple swaps while following some simple rules to match the swap participants.
