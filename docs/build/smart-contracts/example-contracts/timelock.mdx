The [timelock example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/timelock) demonstrates how to write a timelock and implements a greatly simplified claimable balance similar to the [claimable balance](../../guides/transactions/claimable-balances.mdx) feature available on Stellar.

The contract accepts deposits of an amount of a token, and allows other users to claim it before or after a time point.
