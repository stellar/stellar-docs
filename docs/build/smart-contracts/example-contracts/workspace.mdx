The [workspace example] demonstrates how multiple smart contracts can be developed, tested, and built side-by-side in the same Rust workspace.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][oigp]

[oigp]: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main
[workspace example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/workspace

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example use `cargo test`.

```shell
cd workspace
cargo test
```

You should see three sets of output, one for `contract_a`, `contract_a_interface`, and `contract_b`. The first two crates in the workspace contain no tests, but the third crate should give you the following output:

```text
running 1 test
test test::test_token_auth ... ok
```

```

use soroban_sdk::Env;

use crate::{ContractB, ContractBClient};

use soroban_workspace_contract_a::ContractA;

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();

    // Register contract A using the native contract imported.
    let contract_a_id = env.register_contract(None, ContractA);

    // Register contract B defined in this crate.
    let contract_b_id = env.register_contract(None, ContractB);

    // Create a client for calling contract B.
    let client = ContractBClient::new(&env, &contract_b_id);

    // Invoke contract B via its client. Contract B will invoke contract A.
    let sum = client.add_with(&contract_a_id, &5, &7);
    assert_eq!(sum, 12);
}
```

## How It Works

There are three crates that are part of the workspace.

1. `contract_a_interface` contains a trait, `ContractAInterface`, that only serves as a place to define the interface trait for Contract A.
2. `contract_a` contains a smart contract, `ContractA`, that implements logic, and conforms to the `ContractAInterface` trait.
3. `contract_b` is another smart contract, implementing a different interface, and makes a call to `ContractA`, and cross-calls the `contract_a` function. This is also the only crate in the workspace with defined tests.

Let's take a look at each crate, and see how they all work together.

### Contract A Interface: The Trait

The `contract_a_interface` crate defines a trait containing a contract interface. This interface is defined separate from the implementation and only defines what the exported functions of the implementation.

The interface defines `add` as the only function the contract will contain. The `add` function requires two inputs, `x` and `y`, both `u32` integers, and returns a `u32` integer as well.

The use of `contractclient` as an attribute macro on `ContractAInterface` means a client will be created, conforming to this interface, that can be used by contracts existing outside of the `contract_a_interface` crate. As you'll see later, the client, `ContractAClient`, is used in the `contract_b` crate to call the `add` function.

### Contract A: The Logic

The `contract_a` crate contains the implementation for Contract A, defining for each function what it should actually _do_.

The implementation takes the value of `x`, along with the value of `y`, and performs a `checked_add`, returning the sum of both numbers (while avoiding an overflow error).

:::info

The `add` function doesn't require an `Env` argument. That's totally fine! `Env` has many useful features that are available to your smart contracts, if you need them. But, you're not at all required to use it, if you don't.

:::

All that is required to make use of the previously defined `ContractAInterface` is to `use` the interface, define a `ContractA` struct, and `impl` the interface for that struct.

This crate uses the `contractimpl` attribute macro on the `ContractA` implementation, making the `add` function public and invocable by others on the Stellar network.

### Contract B: The Invocation

Now that we've created a trait in `contract_a_interface`, and implemented it in `contract_a`, we can use the `contract_b` crate to invoke the `add` function and get the sum of our integers.

We're creating and implementing an entirely new contract, `ContractB`. We're skipping the trait, and getting right to the contract itself.

::: info

Defining the contract interface with a `trait` separately is optional. It's a great way to share the interface of a contract, and a contract client, with multiple contracts in a multi-contract workspace.

:::

`ContractB` has one function, `add_with`, that requires three arguments:

- `contract: Address` - The address of a contract which implements that required client interface, `ContractAInterface`.
- `x: u32` and `y: u32` - The two numbers we want to (safely) compute the sum of.

`ContractB` invokes `ContractA`'s `add` function, returning its value back to the original invoker. It's a bit of a long round-trip for this simple example, but it illustrates a really powerful way you can separate out interface/trait definitions from contract logic and share it and its client in a multi-contract workspace.

## Practical Use-Case Examples

Beyond this simple example, this technique is versatile and useful. For example, this strategy could be used to:

- Create and reference a standardized, consistent token interface.
- Reuse a single interface that you want to incorporate across many different contracts.

## Build the Contracts

To build the contracts into a set of `.wasm` files, use the `stellar contract build` command. Both `workspace/contract_a` and `workspace/contract_b` will be built, and you can use a single command, since our workspace defines its `members` in the `Cargo.toml` file:

```shell
stellar contract build
```

Two `.wasm` files should be found in the `workspace/target` directory:

```text
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_workspace_contract_a.wasm
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_workspace_contract_b.wasm
```

The [`stellar-cli`] knows the `contract_a_interface` is not intended to be compiled into a .wasm, because the `contract_a_interface`'s `Cargo.toml` has its `crate-type` configured as `rlib` (rust library). Nice!

## Run the Contract

If you have [`stellar-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract the functions. Both contracts must be deployed.

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>
<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```shell
stellar contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_workspace_contract_a.wasm \
```

```shell
stellar contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_workspace_contract_b.wasm \
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract deploy `
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_workspace_contract_a.wasm `
```

```powershell
stellar contract deploy `
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_workspace_contract_b.wasm `
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Invoke `ContractB`'s `add_with` function, passing in `ContractA`'s address for `contract`, and integer values for `x` and `y` (e.g. as `5` and `7`).

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>

```shell
stellar contract invoke \
    --id CONTRACT_B_ADDRESS \
    -- \
    add_with \
    --contract CONTRACT_A_ADDRESS \
    --x 5 \
    --y 7
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract invoke `
    --id CONTRACT_B_ADDRESS `
