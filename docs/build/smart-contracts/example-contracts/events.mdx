The [events example] demonstrates how to publish events from a contract. This example is an extension of the [storing data example].

:::tip[Whisk Changes]

With the release of Whisk, Protocol 23, the syntax for publishing smart contract events has changed. In order to provide the most up-to-date information, this example has been updated to include the new patterns. Find more detailed information in the [Rust SDK documentation].

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `v23.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```sh
git clone -b v23.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [GitHub Codespaces][open-in-github-codespaces] or [Code Anywhere][open-in-code-anywhere].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `events` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```sh
cd events
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="events/src/lib.rs"
const COUNTER: Symbol = symbol_short!("COUNTER");

// Define two static topics for the event: "COUNTER" and "increment".
// Also set the data format to "single-value", which means that the event data
// payload will contain a single value not nested into any data structure.
#[contractevent(topics = ["COUNTER", "increment"], data_format = "single-value")]
struct IncrementEvent {
    count: u32,
}

#[contract]
pub struct IncrementContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementContract {
    /// Increment increments an internal counter, and returns the value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> u32 {
        // Get the current count.
        let mut count: u32 = env.storage().instance().get(&COUNTER).unwrap_or(0); // If no value set, assume 0.

        // Increment the count.
        count += 1;

        // Save the count.
        env.storage().instance().set(&COUNTER, &count);

        // Publish an event about the increment occuring.
        // The event has two static topics ("COUNTER", "increment") and actual
        // count as the data payload.
        IncrementEvent { count }.publish(&env);

        // Return the count to the caller.
        count
    }
}
```

## How it Works

This example contract extends the increment example by publishing an event each time the counter is incremented.

Contract events let contracts emit information about what their contract is doing. Contracts can publish events creating a defined `struct` and `publish`ing it to the smart contract environments.

First, the `#[contractevent]` struct must be defined

```rust
#[contractevent(topics = ["COUNTER", "increment"], data_format = "single-value")]
struct IncrementEvent {
    count: u32,
}
```

Then, inside the contract's function, we can create and publish the event with the relevant data.

```rust
IncrementEvent { count }.publish(&env);
```

### Event Topics

Topics can be defined either statically or dynamically. In the sample code two static topics are used, which will be of the `Symbol` type: `COUNTER` and `increment`.

```rust
#[contractevent(topics = ["COUNTER", "increment"], ...)]
```

:::tip

The topics don't have to be made of the same type.

:::

Topics can also be defined dynamically, inside the struct. In this case, the struct's `snake_case` name will be the first topic. For example, the following event will have two topics: the `Symbol` "increment", followed by an `Address`.

```rust
#[contractevent]
pub struct Increment {
    #[topic]
    addr: Address,
    count: u32,
}
```

### Event Data

An event also contains a data object of any value or type including types defined by contracts using `#[contracttype]`. In the example the data is the `u32` count. The `data_format = "single-value"` tells the event to publish the data alone, with no surrounding data structure.

```rust
#[contractevent(..., data_format = "single-value")]
```

Event data will, by default, conform to the data structure in the defined `struct`. The `data_format` can also be specified as `vec` or `single-value`. Again, please refer to the [Rust SDK documentation] for more details.

### Publishing

Publishing an event is done by calling the `publish` function on the created event struct. The function returns nothing on success, and panics on failure. Possible failure reasons can include malformed inputs (e.g. topic count exceeds limit) and running over the resource budget (TBD). Once successfully published, the new event will be available to applications consuming the events.

```rust
IncrementEvent { count }.publish(&env);
```

:::caution

Published events are discarded if a contract invocation fails due to a panic, budget exhaustion, or when the contract returns an error.

## Tests

Open the [`events/src/test.rs`](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/events/src/test.rs) file to follow along.

```rust title="events/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register(IncrementContract, ());
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(
        env.events().all(),
        vec![
            &env,
            (
                contract_id.clone(),
                (symbol_short!("COUNTER"), symbol_short!("increment")).into_val(&env),
                1u32.into_val(&env)
            ),
        ]
    );
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 2);
    assert_eq!(
        env.events().all(),
        vec![
            &env,
            (
                contract_id.clone(),
                (symbol_short!("COUNTER"), symbol_short!("increment")).into_val(&env),
                2u32.into_val(&env)
            ),
        ]
    );
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 3);
    assert_eq!(
        env.events().all(),
        vec![
            &env,
            (
                contract_id,
                (symbol_short!("COUNTER"), symbol_short!("increment")).into_val(&env),
                3u32.into_val(&env)
            ),
        ]
    );
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register(IncrementContract, ());
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the `#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is `IncrementContract`, and the client is named `IncrementContractClient`.

```rust
let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
```

The example invokes the contract several times.

```rust
assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
```

The example asserts that the event was published.

```rust
assert_eq!(
    env.events().all(),
    vec![
        &env,
        (
            contract_id.clone(),
            (symbol_short!("COUNTER"), symbol_short!("increment")).into_val(&env),
            1u32.into_val(&env)
        ),
    ]
);
```

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `stellar contract build` command.

```sh
stellar contract build
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```
target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_events_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`stellar-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the using it.

<Tabs groupId="platform" defaultValue={getPlatform()}>
<TabItem value="unix" label="macOS/Linux">

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_events_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
stellar contract invoke `
    --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_events_contract.wasm `
    --id 1 `
    -- `
    increment
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following output should occur using the code above.

```
ðŸ“… CAAA... - Success - Event: [{"symbol":"COUNTER"},{"symbol":"increment"}] = {"u32":1}
1
```

A single event is outputted, which is the contract event the contract published. The event contains the two topics, each a `Symbol`, and the data object containing the `u32`.
