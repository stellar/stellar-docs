Start with the [Simple Account example](./simple-account.mdx) to learn the single-signer basics. This Complex Account extends that baseline with multisig and customizable authorization policies. Any time an `Address` pointing at this contract instance is used, the logic defined here runs through the Soroban auth framework.

Contract accounts are exclusive to Soroban and can't be used to perform other Stellar operations.

:::danger

Implementing a contract account requires a very good understanding of authentication and authorization and requires rigorous testing and review. The example here is _not_ a full-fledged account contract - use it as an API reference only.

:::

:::caution

While contract accounts are supported by the Stellar protocol and Soroban SDK, the full client support (such as transaction simulation) is still under development.

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup](../getting-started/setup.mdx) process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `v23.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

```sh
git clone -b v23.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=stellar/soroban-examples&editor=web) or [Code Anywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples).

To run the tests for the example use `cargo test`.

```sh
cargo test -p soroban-account-contract
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test_token_auth ... ok
```

## How it Works

Open the `account/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

Account contracts implement a special function `__check_auth` that takes the signature payload, signatures and authorization context. The function should error if auth is declined, otherwise auth will be approved.

This example contract uses ed25519 keys for signature verification and supports multiple equally weighted signers. It also implements a policy that allows setting per-token limits on transfers. The token can be spent beyond the limit only if every signature is provided.

For example, the user may initialize this contract with 2 keys and introduce 100 USDC spend limit. This way they can use a single key to sign their contract invocations and be sure that even if they sign a malicious transaction they won't spend more than 100 USDC.

### Initialization

```rust title="account/src/lib.rs"
#[contract]
struct AccountContract;

#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
enum DataKey {
    SignerCnt,
    Signer(BytesN<32>),
    SpendLimit(Address),
}

...

#[contractimpl]
impl AccountContract {
    // Initialize the contract with a list of ed25519 public key ('signers').
    pub fn __constructor(env: Env, signers: Vec<BytesN<32>>) {
        // In reality this would need some additional validation on signers
        // (deduplication etc.).
        for signer in signers.iter() {
            env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Signer(signer), &());
        }
        env.storage()
            .instance()
            .set(&DataKey::SignerCnt, &signers.len());
    }

    ...
}
```

This account contract needs to work with the public keys explicitly. Here we initialize the contract with ed25519 keys.

We use constructor in order to ensure that the contract instance is created and initialized atomically (without constructor there is a risk that someone frontruns the initialization of the contract and sets their own public keys).

### Policy modification

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl AccountContract {
    ...

    // Adds a limit on any token transfers that aren't signed by every signer.
    // For the sake of simplicity of the example the limit is only applied on
    // a per-authorization basis; the 'real' limits should likely be time-based
    // instead.
    pub fn add_limit(env: Env, token: Address, limit: i128) {
        // The current contract address is the account contract address and has
        // the same semantics for `require_auth` call as any other account
        // contract address.
        // Note, that if a contract *invokes* another contract, then it would
        // authorize the call on its own behalf and that wouldn't require any
        // user-side verification.
        env.current_contract_address().require_auth();
        env.storage()
            .instance()
            .set(&DataKey::SpendLimit(token), &limit);
    }
}
```

This function allows users to set and modify the per-token spend limit described above. The neat trick here is that `require_auth` can be used for the `current_contract_address()`, i.e. the account contract may be used to verify authorization for its own administrative functions. This way there is no need to write duplicate authorization and authentication logic.

### `__check_auth`

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct AccSignature {
    pub public_key: BytesN<32>,
    pub signature: BytesN<64>,
}

#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum AccError {
    NotEnoughSigners = 1,
    NegativeAmount = 2,
    BadSignatureOrder = 3,
    UnknownSigner = 4,
}

...

#[contractimpl]
impl CustomAccountInterface for AccountContract {
    type Signature = Vec<AccSignature>;
    type Error = AccError;

    // This is the 'entry point' of the account contract and every account
    // contract has to implement it. `require_auth` calls for the Address of
    // this contract will result in calling this `__check_auth` function with
    // the appropriate arguments.
    //
    // This should return `()` if authentication and authorization checks have
    // been passed and return an error (or panic) otherwise.
    //
    // `__check_auth` takes the payload that needed to be signed, arbitrarily
    // typed signatures (`Vec<AccSignature>` contract type here) and authorization
    // context that contains all the invocations that this call tries to verify.
    //
    // `__check_auth` has to authenticate the signatures. It also may use
    // `auth_context` to implement additional authorization policies (like token
    // spend limits here).
    //
    // Soroban host guarantees that `__check_auth` is only being called during
    // `require_auth` verification and hence this may mutate its own state
    // without the need for additional authorization (for example, this could
    // store per-time-period token spend limits instead of just enforcing the
    // limit per contract call).
    //
    // Note, that `__check_auth` function shouldn't call `require_auth` on the
    // contract's own address in order to avoid infinite recursion.
    #[allow(non_snake_case)]
    fn __check_auth(
        env: Env,
        signature_payload: Hash<32>,
        signatures: Self::Signature,
        auth_context: Vec<Context>,
    ) -> Result<(), AccError> {
        // Perform authentication.
        authenticate(&env, &signature_payload, &signatures)?;

        let tot_signers: u32 = env
            .storage()
            .instance()
            .get::<_, u32>(&DataKey::SignerCnt)
            .unwrap();
        let all_signed = tot_signers == signatures.len();

        let curr_contract = env.current_contract_address();

        // This is a map for tracking the token spend limits per token. This
        // makes sure that if e.g. multiple `transfer` calls are being authorized
        // for the same token we still respect the limit for the total
        // transferred amount (and not the 'per-call' limits).
        let mut spend_left_per_token = Map::<Address, i128>::new(&env);
        // Verify the authorization policy.
        for context in auth_context.iter() {
            verify_authorization_policy(
                &env,
                &context,
                &curr_contract,
                all_signed,
                &mut spend_left_per_token,
            )?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

`__check_auth` is a special function that account contracts implement. It will be called by the Soroban environment every time `require_auth` or `require_auth_for_args` is called for the address of the account contract.

Here it is implemented in two steps. First, authentication is performed using the signature payload and a vector of signatures. Second, authorization policy is enforced using the `auth_context` vector. This vector contains all the contract calls that are being authorized by the provided signatures.

`__check_auth` is a reserved function and can only be called by the Soroban environment in response to a call to `require_auth`. Any direct call to `__check_auth` will fail. This makes it safe to write to the account contract storage from `__check_auth`, as it's guaranteed to not be called in unexpected context. In this example it's possible to persist the spend limits without worrying that they'll be exhausted via a bad actor calling `__check_auth` directly.

### Authentication

```rust
fn authenticate(
    env: &Env,
    signature_payload: &Hash<32>,
    signatures: &Vec<AccSignature>,
) -> Result<(), AccError> {
    for i in 0..signatures.len() {
        let signature = signatures.get_unchecked(i);
        if i > 0 {
            let prev_signature = signatures.get_unchecked(i - 1);
            if prev_signature.public_key >= signature.public_key {
                return Err(AccError::BadSignatureOrder);
            }
        }
        if !env
            .storage()
            .instance()
            .has(&DataKey::Signer(signature.public_key.clone()))
        {
            return Err(AccError::UnknownSigner);
        }
        env.crypto().ed25519_verify(
            &signature.public_key,
            &signature_payload.clone().into(),
            &signature.signature,
        );
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Authentication here simply checks that the provided signatures are valid given the payload and also that they belong to the signers of this account contract.

### Authorization policy

```rust
fn verify_authorization_policy(
    env: &Env,
    context: &Context,
    curr_contract: &Address,
    all_signed: bool,
    spend_left_per_token: &mut Map<Address, i128>,
) -> Result<(), AccError> {
    // There are no limitations when every signers signs the transaction.
    if all_signed {
        return Ok(());
    }
    let contract_context = match context {
        Context::Contract(c) => {
            // Allow modifying this contract only if every signer has signed for it.
            if &c.contract == curr_contract {
                return Err(AccError::NotEnoughSigners);
            }
            c
        }
        // Allow creating new contracts only if every signer has signed for it.
        Context::CreateContractHostFn(_) | Context::CreateContractWithCtorHostFn(_) => {
            return Err(AccError::NotEnoughSigners);
        }
    };

    ...
}
```

We verify the policy per `Context`. i.e. per one `require_auth` call for the address of this account. The policy for the account contract itself enforces every signer to have signed the method call.

```rust
fn verify_authorization_policy(
    env: &Env,
    context: &Context,
    curr_contract: &Address,
    all_signed: bool,
    spend_left_per_token: &mut Map<Address, i128>,
) -> Result<(), AccError> {
    ...

    // Besides the checks above we're only interested in functions that spend tokens.
    if contract_context.fn_name != TRANSFER_FN
        && contract_context.fn_name != APPROVE_FN
        && contract_context.fn_name != BURN_FN
    {
        return Ok(());
    }

    let spend_left: Option<i128> =
        if let Some(spend_left) = spend_left_per_token.get(contract_context.contract.clone()) {
            Some(spend_left)
        } else if let Some(limit_left) = env
            .storage()
            .instance()
            .get::<_, i128>(&DataKey::SpendLimit(contract_context.contract.clone()))
        {
            Some(limit_left)
        } else {
            None
        };

    // 'None' means that the contract is outside of the policy.
    if let Some(spend_left) = spend_left {
        // 'amount' is the third argument in both `approve` and `transfer`.
        // If the contract has a different signature, it's safer to panic
        // here, as it's expected to have the standard interface.
        let spent: i128 = contract_context
            .args
            .get(2)
            .unwrap()
            .try_into_val(env)
            .unwrap();
        if spent < 0 {
            return Err(AccError::NegativeAmount);
        }
        if !all_signed && spent > spend_left {
            return Err(AccError::NotEnoughSigners);
        }
        spend_left_per_token.set(contract_context.contract.clone(), spend_left - spent);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Then we check for the standard token function names and verify that for these function we don't exceed the spending limits.

### Tests

Open the [`account/src/test.rs`](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v23.0.0/account/src/test.rs) file to follow along.

Refer to another examples for the general information on the test setup.

Here we only look at some points specific to the account contracts.

```rust
fn sign(e: &Env, signer: &Keypair, payload: &BytesN<32>) -> Val {
    AccSignature {
        public_key: signer_public_key(e, signer),
        signature: signer
            .sign(payload.to_array().as_slice())
            .to_bytes()
            .into_val(e),
    }
    .into_val(e)
}
```

Unlike most of the contracts that may simply use `Address`, account contracts deal with the signature verification and hence need to actually sign the payloads.

```rust
let payload = BytesN::random(&env);
let token = Address::generate(&env);
// `__check_auth` can't be called directly, hence we need to use
// `try_invoke_contract_check_auth` testing utility that emulates being
// called by the Soroban host during a `require_auth` call.
env.try_invoke_contract_check_auth::<AccError>(
    &account_contract.address,
    &payload,
    vec![&env, sign(&env, &signers[0], &payload)].into(),
    &vec![
        &env,
        token_auth_context(&env, &token, Symbol::new(&env, "transfer"), 1000),
    ],
)
.unwrap();
```

`__check_auth` can't be called directly as regular contract functions, hence we need to use `try_invoke_contract_check_auth` testing utility that emulates being called by the Soroban host during a `require_auth` call.

```rust
// Add a spend limit of 1000 per 1 signer.
account_contract.add_limit(&token, &1000);
// Verify that this call needs to be authorized.
assert_eq!(
    env.auths(),
    std::vec![(
        account_contract.address.clone(),
        AuthorizedInvocation {
            function: AuthorizedFunction::Contract((
                account_contract.address.clone(),
                symbol_short!("add_limit"),
                (token.clone(), 1000_i128).into_val(&env),
            )),
            sub_invocations: std::vec![]
        }
    )]
);
```

Asserting the contract-specific error to `try_invoke_contract_check_auth` allows verifying the exact error code and makes sure that the verification has failed due to not having enough signers and not for any other reason.

It's a good idea for the account contract to have detailed error codes and verify that they are returned when they are expected.

```rust
// 1 signer no longer can perform the token operation that transfers more
// than 1000 units.
assert_eq!(
    env.try_invoke_contract_check_auth::<AccError>(
        &account_contract.address,
        &payload,
        vec![&env, sign(&env, &signers[0], &payload)].into(),
        &vec![
            &env,
            token_auth_context(&env, &token, Symbol::new(&env, "transfer"), 1001)
        ],
    )
    .err()
    .unwrap()
    .unwrap(),
    AccError::NotEnoughSigners
);
```
