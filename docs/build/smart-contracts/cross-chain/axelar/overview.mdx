# Overview

[Axelar](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/intro/) is a cross-chain communication network that enables secure interoperability between blockchain ecosystems. It allows developers to build applications communicating across blockchains, regardless of their consensus mechanisms or message payloads.

Key features of Axelar include:

- **Secure Cross-chain Communication**: Built on a [proof-of-stake security model](https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/security#proof-of-stake-consensus) similar to many of the chains it connects.
- **Permissionless Design**: Transactions cannot be censored by any oracle, relayer, or validator.
- **Token Transfers + Messaging**: Support for both token transfers and arbitrary message passing between chains.

## Stellar and Axelar Integration

The Stellar and Axelar integration brings cross-chain capabilities to the Stellar ecosystem, allowing developers to build applications that can interact with other blockchain networks. This integration opens up new possibilities for Stellar applications, including:

- Sending messages between Stellar and other blockchains.
- Transferring assets across chain boundaries.
- Building truly interoperable decentralized applications.

## Core Components

The Stellar and Axelar integration relies on two main contracts:

### Stellar Gateway Contract

The [Gateway contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar/tree/main/contracts/stellar-axelar-gateway) facilitates sending and receiving cross-chain messages between Stellar and other chains via the Axelar Network.

```rust
pub fn call_contract(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
){}
```

This function initiates a cross-chain message from Stellar to another blockchain by specifying the following:

- The destination chain name
- The destination contract address
- The payload (message content)

### Stellar Gas Service

The [Gas Service contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar/tree/main/contracts/stellar-axelar-gas-service) handles payment for cross-chain transaction execution. Before sending a message through the Gateway, you must pay for gas using this service.

```rust
fn pay_gas(
    env: Env,
    sender: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
    spender: Address,
    token: Token,
    metadata: Bytes,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>;
```

## Sending Cross-chain Messages

To send messages from Stellar to other blockchains, you'll need to:

1. Pay for gas using the Gas Service.
2. Call the Gateway's `call_contract` function.

Here's a practical example of how this might look in your Stellar smart contract:

```rust
fn send(
    env: &Env,
    caller: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    message: Bytes,
    gas_token: Option<Token>,
) {
    let gateway = AxelarGatewayMessagingClient::new(env, &Self::gateway(env));
    let gas_service = AxelarGasServiceClient::new(env, &Self::gas_service(env));

    // Verify the caller's authorization
    caller.require_auth();

    // Pay for gas if a gas token is provided
    if let Some(gas_token) = gas_token {
        gas_service.pay_gas(
            &env.current_contract_address(),
            &destination_chain,
            &destination_address,
            &message,
            &caller,
            &gas_token,
            &Bytes::new(env),
        );
    }

    // Send the cross-chain message
    gateway.call_contract(
        &env.current_contract_address(),
        &destination_chain,
        &destination_address,
        &message,
    );
}
```

This function handles the gas payment and the actual message, sending in one convenient method.

## Receiving Cross-chain Messages

Your Stellar smart contract must implement the `__executable` function to receive messages from other chains. Here is an example:

```rust
fn __execute(
    env: &Env,
    source_chain: String,
    message_id: String,
    source_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
);
```

This function processes incoming cross-chain messages, allowing your contract to respond to data from other blockchains.

### Message Validation

When receiving messages from other chains, validating their authenticity is important. Axelar handles this validation in two ways:

1. **Automatic validation** when implementing the `AxelarExecutable` trait: When you derive the `AxelarExecutable` trait for your contract, message validation happens automatically. The trait implementation calls the Gateway's `validate_message` function before invoking your contract's `__execute` method, ensuring only valid messages are processed.

2. **Manual validation** when you need custom validation logic:

   ```rust
   fn validate_incoming_message(
       env: &Env,
       source_chain: String,
       message_id: String,
       source_address: String,
       payload: Bytes,
   ) -> bool {
       let gateway_client = AxelarGatewayMessagingClient::new(env, &self.gateway_address);
       let payload_hash = env.crypto().keccak256(&payload).into();

       gateway_client.validate_message(
           &env.current_contract_address(),
           &source_chain,
           &message_id,
           &source_address,
           &payload_hash,
       )
   }
   ```

In both cases, the Gateway contract ensures that only messages approved by Axelar validators are processed, protecting your application from unauthorized cross-chain messages.

## Getting Started

To start developing cross-chain applications with Stellar and Axelar:

1. Set up your Stellar contract with dependencies for the Axelar integration.

2. Initialize your contract with Gateway, Gas Service, and Interchain Token Service addresses.

3. Implement cross-chain capabilities:

- For sending: Use the [Gateway](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar/tree/main/contracts/stellar-axelar-gateway) and [Gas Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar/tree/main/contracts/stellar-axelar-gas-service) clients
- For receiving: Implement the [`AxelarExecutable`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar/blob/08c01a83adffe8bf8c68766230bfbf4b78b85557/contracts/stellar-axelar-gateway/src/executable.rs#L11) trait.
- For tokens: Leverage the [Interchain Token Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar/tree/main/contracts/stellar-interchain-token-service).

4. Test and deploy using [Axelar's testnet](https://testnet.axelarscan.io) before going to production
