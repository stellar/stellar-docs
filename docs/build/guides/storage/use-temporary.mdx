Temporary storage is useful for a contract to store data that can quickly become irrelevant or out-dated. For example, here's how a contract might be used to store a recent price of AstroPesos against AstroDollars.

```rust
// This function updates the PEN price
pub fn update_pen_price(env: Env, price: i128) {
  env.storage().temporary().set(&!symbol_short("PEN"), &price);
}

// This function reads and returns the current PEN price (zero if the storage
// entry is archived)
pub fn get_pen_price(env: Env) -> i128 {
  if let Some(price) = env.storage().temporary().get(&!symbol_short("PEN")) {
    price
  } else {
    0
  }
}
```
