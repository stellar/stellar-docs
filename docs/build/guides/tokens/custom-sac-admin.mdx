description: Set a custom administrator account on a deployed SAC
---

The [Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)](../../../tokens/stellar-asset-contract.mdx) includes functionality to set a custom administration account on the contract itself. This can be seen as a security precaution, similar to locking an asset's issuer account after creating the total supply of tokens. It should also be noted that an asset's issuer account can have a distinct set of signatures and weights, and these are unrelated to the SAC admin address.

## Considerations

To effectively utilize the SAC admin functionality, you should be aware of a few things first:

- When a SAC is initially enabled for an issued asset, the `Admin` address on the contract defaults to the issuer account.
- A SAC `Admin` address can be either a regular Stellar account (`G...`), or it can be a smart contract (`C...`) address. This opens up the possibility of programmatically minting and taking other administrative actions for an asset by way of a smart contract invocation.
- Changing a SAC `Admin` address (initially) requires authorization from the asset's issuer account. After the `Admin` address has been set the first time, subsequent changes will require authorization from the _current_ `Admin` address.
- If an asset's issuer account is locked while the SAC `Admin` address has not been changed, it will _never_ be possible to change the SAC `Admin` address.
- If an asset's issuer account is locked after the SAC `Admin` address has been changed, tokens will still be mint-able from the SAC as long as it's authorized by the _current_ `Admin` address.

## Example

The following example will create a new Stellar asset, `STAR:GCS5NEHKJALCSVJAKIORXXVS554QQV5FNDLBK33CCAH6UIRYPXYZFC34`.

### Enable the built-in SAC contract

First, we'll enable the SAC contract using the Stellar CLI:

```shell
stellar contract asset deploy \
    --source starIssuer --network testnet \
    --asset STAR:GCS5NEHKJALCSVJAKIORXXVS554QQV5FNDLBK33CCAH6UIRYPXYZFC34
# CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF
```

This gives us the SAC address of `CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF`.

:::note

We're using the asset's issuer account here to enable the SAC on the Testnet network, but this could be done using _any_ account.

:::

### Check the initial `Admin` address

Now that we have the SAC deployed to the network, we can invoke the `admin` function to find out what its current `Admin` address is:

```shell
stellar contract invoke \
    --source starIssuer --network testnet \
    --id CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF \
    -- \
    admin
# GCS5NEHKJALCSVJAKIORXXVS554QQV5FNDLBK33CCAH6UIRYPXYZFC34
```

Unsurprisingly, it's set to the issuer's `GCS5...` account. Let's change that.

### Set the `Admin` address to a new `G...` account

We can set this `Admin` address to any account that we want. Including an account that's un-funded on the network. As long as you're able to provide a valid signature for the account, which would take into consideration any multisig or signature weights that have been set up, you can use this event for future administration of the asset from within the contract.

:::info

Ensure that whatever account you're using for this `Admin` address has a way to sign transactions. That would mean you have a secret key or seed phrase for it.

:::

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
    --source starIssuer --network testnet \
    --id CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF \
    -- \
    set_admin --new_admin GBL3IQ6KA3I7CS7C5ABTCU7CJJA7X76SBZKTTQVJ4APW5646DXEIQKHB
```

Now, invoking the `admin` function of the contract will return this new `GBL3...` address, rather than the original issuer of the asset.

```shell
stellar contract invoke \
    --source starIssuer --network testnet \
    --id CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF \
    -- \
    admin
# GBL3IQ6KA3I7CS7C5ABTCU7CJJA7X76SBZKTTQVJ4APW5646DXEIQKHB
```

:::info

If you examine the asset's `GCS5...` issuer account, you won't see anything different. The signers/weights will be exactly the same. The only place this change is seen is _within_ the SAC for this asset.

:::

### Set the `Admin` address to some contract `C...` address

For this part of the example, we'll use a very simple "minter" contract as the `Admin` address. It has a very simple implementation, and only one main function, `start_mint`:

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn __constructor(env: Env, sac_address: Address) {
        env.storage().instance().set(&symbol_short!("SAC_ADDR"), &sac_address);
    }

    pub fn star_mint(env: Env, to: Address, amount: i128) {
        let sac_address: Address = env.storage().instance().get(&symbol_short!("SAC_ADDR")).unwrap();
        let token_client = token::StellarAssetClient::new(&env, &sac_address);
        token_client.mint(&to, &amount);
    }
}
```

This contract gets deployed, and the address might be (for example) `CCOQXM7XPEUZKAFEHBXBFS3VJVWJBOU6JK5B7B3Z6VUDX3OCESD3P6TI`. We can now set the SAC `Admin` address to this contract:

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
    --source newStarAdmin --network testnet \
    --id CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF \
    -- \
    set_admin --new_admin CCOQXM7XPEUZKAFEHBXBFS3VJVWJBOU6JK5B7B3Z6VUDX3OCESD3P6TI
```

Double-checking our work with the `admin` function of the SAC, we'll see that our minter contract is now the `Admin` address:

```shell
stellar contract invoke \
    --source starIssuer --network testnet \
    --id CBVYF2KJ72BRPLVPCUL3PGWDO5RK2XP4AJDHKX7GDDBJW42L2C6VT3SF \
    -- \
    admin
# CCOQXM7XPEUZKAFEHBXBFS3VJVWJBOU6JK5B7B3Z6VUDX3OCESD3P6TI
```

Now, since the minter contract is the administrator of the SAC, we can invoke its `star_mint` function from any account we like. (Reminder: if you're using a `G...` address with the `mint` function of a SAC, it will need a trustline created for the asset beforehand.)

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
    --source randomStarHolder --network testnet \
    --id CCOQXM7XPEUZKAFEHBXBFS3VJVWJBOU6JK5B7B3Z6VUDX3OCESD3P6TI \
    -- \
    star_mint --to randomStarHolder --amount 1000000000
```

Now, this `randomStarHolder` account will have a balance of 100 STAR, and the token minting was authorized by the minter contract itself.

### Making a `payment` operation from the issuer account

Since we haven't locked down the signer(s) of our issuer account, it's still entirely possible for the `GCS5...` issuer account to create and submit to the network any `payment` operations it wants. This means tokens could still be minted with a `payment` operation, or burned with a `clawback` operation, or trustline flags modified, all using the original asset issuer's account. The `Admin` address of the SAC and the signing permissions of the account operate and function independently of one another.

## In the wild

A fun example of a project utilizing a custom administrator address on a SAC can be found with the [KALE Project](https://github.com/kalepail/KALE-sc). The KALE issuer is `GBDVX4VELCDSQ54KQJYTNHXAHFLBCA77ZY2USQBM4CSHTTV7DME7KALE`, but you can see the `Admin` address for the SAC is set to another contract:

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
    --source S... --network mainnet \
    --id CB23WRDQWGSP6YPMY4UV5C4OW5CBTXKYN3XEATG7KJEZCXMJBYEHOUOV \
    -- \
    admin
# CDL74RF5BLYR2YBLCCI7F5FB6TPSCLKEJUBSD2RSVWZ4YHF3VMFAIGWA
```

This [`CDL7...` contract](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/contract/CDL74RF5BLYR2YBLCCI7F5FB6TPSCLKEJUBSD2RSVWZ4YHF3VMFAIGWA) is the "homestead" contract created to facilitate the minting/burning/mining of the KALE asset.
