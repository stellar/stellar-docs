## Introduction

Upgrading a smart contract allows you to improve or modify your contract without changing its address. This guide will walk you through the process of upgrading a WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode contract using the Soroban SDK.

### Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of [Rust programming language]. To brush up on Rust, check out [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) or [The Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
- Familiarity with [Stellar smart contracts](../../smart-contracts/getting-started/hello-world.mdx)
- Installed [Stellar CLI](../../smart-contracts/getting-started/setup.mdx#install-the-stellar-cli) and Soroban SDK

### Download the upgradeable contract example

### Code

The example contains both an "old" and "new" contract, where we upgrade from "old" to "new". The code below is for the "old" contract.

```rust title="upgradeable_contract/old_contract/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]

use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, contracterror, contracttype, Address, BytesN, Env};

#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
enum DataKey {
    Admin,
}

#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum Error {
    AlreadyInitialized = 1,
}

#[contract]
pub struct UpgradeableContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl UpgradeableContract {
    pub fn init(e: Env, admin: Address) {
        if e.storage().instance().has(&DataKey::Admin) {
            return Err(Error::AlreadyInitialized);
        }
        e.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Admin, &admin);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn version() -> u32 {
        1
    }

    pub fn upgrade(e: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
        let admin: Address = e.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Admin).unwrap();
        admin.require_auth();

        e.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
    }
}

```

## How it works

When upgrading a contract, the key function used is `e.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm`, which takes the Wasm hash of the new contract as a parameter. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how this process works:

1. **No change in contract ID**: The contract's ID remains the same even after the upgrade. This ensures that all references to the contract stay intact.
2. **Admin authorization**: Before upgrading, the contract checks if the action is authorized by an admin. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized upgrades. Only someone with admin rights can perform the upgrade.
3. **The upgrade function**: Below is the function that handles the upgrade process:

```rust
pub fn upgrade(e: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
    let admin: Address = e.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Admin).unwrap();
    admin.require_auth();

    e.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
}
```

- `e: Env`: The environment object representing the current state of the blockchain.
- `new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>`: The hash of the new Wasm code for the contract. The Wasm bytecode must already be installed/present on the ledger.
- The function first retrieves the admin's address from the contract's storage.
- It then requires the admin's authorization (`admin.require_auth()`) to proceed.
- Finally, it updates the contract with the new Wasm code (`e.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)`).

4. The `update_current_contract_wasm` host function will also emit a `SYSTEM` contract [event] that contains the old and new wasm reference, allowing downstream users to be notified when a contract they use is updated. The event structure will have `topics = ["executable_update", old_executable: ContractExecutable, old_executable: ContractExecutable]` and `data = []`.

## Tests

Open the `upgradeable_contract/old_contract/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="upgradeable_contract/old_contract/srctest.rs"
#![cfg(test)]

use crate::Error;
use soroban_sdk::{testutils::Address as _, Address, BytesN, Env};

mod old_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file =
            "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm"
    );
}

mod new_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../new_contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm"
    );
}

fn install_new_wasm(e: &Env) -> BytesN<32> {
    e.install_contract_wasm(new_contract::Wasm)
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    // Note that we use register_contract_wasm instead of register_contract
    // because the old contracts Wasm is expected to exist in storage.
    let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, old_contract::Wasm);

    let client = old_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let admin = Address::random(&env);
    client.init(&admin);

    assert_eq!(1, client.version());

    let new_wasm_hash = install_new_wasm(&env);

    client.upgrade(&new_wasm_hash);
    assert_eq!(2, client.version());

    // new_v2_fn was added in the new contract, so the existing
    // client is out of date. Generate a new one.
    let client = new_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    assert_eq!(1010101, client.new_v2_fn());
}


#[test]
fn test_cannot_re_init() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    // Note that we use register_contract_wasm instead of register_contract
    // because the old contracts WASM is expected to exist in storage.
    let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, old_contract::WASM);
    let client = old_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    client.init(&admin);

    // `try_init` is expected to return an error. Since client is generated from Wasm,
    // this is a generic SDK error.
    let err: soroban_sdk::Error = client.try_init(&admin).err().unwrap().unwrap();
    // Convert the SDK error to the contract error.
    let contract_err: Error = err.try_into().unwrap();
    // Make sure contract error has the expected value.
    assert_eq!(contract_err, Error::AlreadyInitialized);
}

```

We first import Wasm files for both contracts:

```rust
mod old_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file =
            "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm"
    );
}

mod new_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../new_contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm"
    );
}
```

We register the old contract, intialize it with an admin, and verify the version it returns. The note in the code below is important:

```rust
// Note that we use register_contract_wasm instead of register_contract
// because the old contracts Wasm is expected to exist in storage.
let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, old_contract::Wasm);

let client = old_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
let admin = Address::random(&env);
client.init(&admin);

assert_eq!(1, client.version());
```

We install the new contract's Wasm:

```rust
let new_wasm_hash = install_new_wasm(&env);
```

Then we run the upgrade, and verify that the upgrade worked:

```rust
client.upgrade(&new_wasm_hash);
assert_eq!(2, client.version());
```

## Build the contract

To build the contract `.wasm` files, run `stellar contract build` in both `upgradeable_contract/old_contract` and `upgradeable_contract/new_contract` in that order.

Both `.wasm` files should be found in both contract `target` directories after building both contracts:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm
```

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm
```

## Run the contract

If you have [`stellar-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions. Deploy the old contract and install the Wasm for the new contract.

Navigate to to `upgradeable_contract/old_contract`

```sh
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm \
  --source alice  \
  --network testnet
```

- When you deploy a smart contract to a network, you need to specify an identity that will be used to sign the transactions. Change the `alice` to your own [identity].

[identity]: ../../smart-contracts/getting-started/setup.mdx#configure-an-identity

You should see this similar contract ID after you have ran the deploy command:

```
CAS6FKBXGVXFGU2SPPPJJOIULJNPMPR6NVKWLOQP24SZJPMB76TGH7Y3
```

Navigate to `upgradeable_contract/new_contract` and run the following command:

```
stellar contract install \
--source-account alice \
--wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm \
--network testnet
```

You should see this Wasm hash from the install command:

```
aa24c81289997ad815489b29db337b53f284cca5aba86e9a8ae5cef7d31842c2
```

You also need to call the `init` method so the `admin` address is set. This requires us to setup some [identities].

[identities]: ../../smart-contracts/getting-started/setup.mdx#configure-an-identity

Given that we have previously setup an identity, to get the identity address, we run the following command:

```sh
stellar keys address alice
```

Example output:

```
GCJ2R5ST4UQP2D4F54Y3IIAQKPMLMEEZCNZ3PEDKY4AGDYEMYUC2MOO7
```

Navigate to `upgradeable_contract/old_contract` and now call `init` with this key (make sure to substitute with the key you generated):

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CAS6FKBXGVXFGU2SPPPJJOIULJNPMPR6NVKWLOQP24SZJPMB76TGH7Y3 \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  init \
  --admin GCJ2R5ST4UQP2D4F54Y3IIAQKPMLMEEZCNZ3PEDKY4AGDYEMYUC2MOO7
```

Our deployed `old_contract` address is `CAS6FKBXGVXFGU2SPPPJJOIULJNPMPR6NVKWLOQP24SZJPMB76TGH7Y3`. You may need to replace this value with your own. Invoke the `version` function of the contract:

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CAS6FKBXGVXFGU2SPPPJJOIULJNPMPR6NVKWLOQP24SZJPMB76TGH7Y3 \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  version

```

The following output should occur using the code above:

```json
1
```

Now upgrade the contract. Notice the `--source` must be the identity name matching the address passed to the `init` function.

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CAS6FKBXGVXFGU2SPPPJJOIULJNPMPR6NVKWLOQP24SZJPMB76TGH7Y3 \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  upgrade \
  --new_wasm_hash aa24c81289997ad815489b29db337b53f284cca5aba86e9a8ae5cef7d31842c2
```

Invoke the `version` function again.

```sh
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CAS6FKBXGVXFGU2SPPPJJOIULJNPMPR6NVKWLOQP24SZJPMB76TGH7Y3 \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  version
```

Now that the contract was upgraded, you'll see a new version.

```json
2
```

Hooray, our contract has been upgraded!
