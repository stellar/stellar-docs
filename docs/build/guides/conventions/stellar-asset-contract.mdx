title: Integrate Stellar Assets Contracts
description: Test and use Stellar assets in a Soroban smart contract
---

From the contract perspective Stellar Asset Contract is not different from any other token that implements the Soroban token interface. The Rust SDK contains a pregenerated client for any contract that implements the token interface:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::token;

struct MyContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl MyContract {
  fn token_fn(e: Env, id: Address) {
    // Create a client instance for the provided token identifier. If the id
    // value corresponds to an SAC contract, then SAC implementation is used.
    let client = token::Client::new(&env, &id);
    // Call token operations part of the SEP-41 token interface
    client.transfer(...);
  }
}
```

:::info Clients

A client created by [`token::Client`] implements the functions defined by any contract that implements the [SEP-41 Token Interface]. But the Stellar Asset Contract exposes additional functions such as `mint`. To access the additional functions, another client needs to be used: [`token::StellarAssetClient`]. This client only implements the functions which are not part of the SEP-41.

```rust
let client = token::StellarAssetClient::new(&env, &id);
// Call token operations which are not part of the SEP-41 token interface
// but part of the CAP-46-6 Smart Contract Standardized Asset
client.mint(...);
```

### Examples

See the full examples that utilize the token contract in various ways for more details:

- [Timelock](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/timelock.mdx) and [single offer](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/single-offer-sale.mdx) move token via `xfer` to and from the contract
- [Atomic swap](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/atomic-swap.mdx) uses `incr_allow` to transfer token on behalf of the user

Notice, that these examples don't do anything to support SAC specifically.

### Testing

Soroban Rust SDK provides an easy way to instantiate a Stellar Asset Contract tokens using `register_stellar_asset_contract`. For example:

```rust
let admin = Address::random();
let user = Address::random();
let token = StellarAssetClient::new(e, &e.register_stellar_asset_contract(admin.clone()));
token.mint(&admin, &user, &1000);
```

See the tests in the [examples](#examples) above for the full test implementation.
