title: Integrate Stellar Assets Contracts
description: Test and use Stellar assets in a Soroban smart contract
---

From the contract perspective Stellar Asset Contract is not different from any other token that implements the Soroban [SEP-41 Token Interface]. The Rust SDK contains a pregenerated client for any contract that implements the token interface:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::token;

struct MyContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl MyContract {
  fn token_fn(e: Env, id: Address) {
    // Create a client instance for the provided token identifier. If the id
    // value corresponds to an SAC contract, then SAC implementation is used.
    let client = token::TokenClient::new(&env, &id);
    // Call token operations part of the SEP-41 token interface
    client.transfer(...);
  }
}
```

:::info Clients

A client created by [`token::Client`] implements the functions defined by any contract that implements the [SEP-41 Token Interface]. But with [CAP-46-6 smart contract standardized asset], the Stellar Asset Contract exposes additional functions such as `mint`. To access the additional functions, another client needs to be used: [`token::StellarAssetClient`]. This client only implements the functions from CAP-46-6, which are not part of the SEP-41.

```rust
let client = token::StellarAssetClient::new(&env, &id);
// Call token operations which are not part of the SEP-41 token interface
// but part of the CAP-46-6 Smart Contract Standardized Asset
client.mint(...);
```

### Testing

Soroban Rust SDK provides an easy way to instantiate a Stellar Asset Contract tokens using `register_stellar_asset_contract`. This function can be seen as the deployment of a generic token. In the following example, we are following the best practices outlined in the [Issuing and Distribution Accounts section](../../../tokens/control-asset-access.mdx#issuing-and-distribution-accounts):

```rust
#![cfg(test)]

use soroban_sdk::testutils::Address as _;
use soroban_sdk::{token, Address, Env};
use token::TokenClient;
use token::StellarAssetClient;

#[test]
fn test() {
    let e = Env::default();
    e.mock_all_auths();

    let issuer = Address::random();
    let distributer = Address::random();

    let token_address = e.register_stellar_asset_contract(issuer.clone());

    // client for SEP-41 operations
    let token = TokenClient::new(&e, &token_address);
    // client for Stellar Asset Contract operations
    let token_sac = StellarAssetClient::new(&e, &token_address);

    // 1e7 diff between minimal unit and unit itself
    let genesis_amount: i128 = 1_000_000_000 * 10_000_000;

    token_sac.mint(&issuer, &distributer, &genesis_amount);

    assert_eq!(token.balance(&distributor), genesis_amount);
```

### Examples

See the full examples that utilize the token contract in various ways for more details:

- [Timelock](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/timelock.mdx) and [single offer](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/single-offer-sale.mdx) move token via `xfer` to and from the contract
- [Atomic swap](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/atomic-swap.mdx) uses `incr_allow` to transfer token on behalf of the user
