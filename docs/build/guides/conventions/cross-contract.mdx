title: Making Cross Contract Calls
description: Call a smart contract from within another smart contract
---

As with developing software in any language, developing a Soroban smart contract with a rich feature set can be a challenging and time-consuming task. Thankfully, someone else might already have solved part of your issues or build components which could be reused. The open source community is vibrant and Stellar's community does not disappoint.

There are two kind of dependencies which can be introduced in a Soroban smart contract.

1. Other Rust crates can be used (provided that they are compatible with Soroban's [Rust dialect](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/rust-dialect.mdx));
2. Other smart contract can be used. This is referred to as a [Cross-Contract](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/contract-interactions/cross-contract.mdx) call.

In the following, we will see how other contracts can be leveraged from within another contract.

## Contract as a dependency

While finding a contract is out of scope for this guide, there are a few place to be on a lookout. Most project and dApp are publicly disclosing on their website the address of their Soroban smart contract. With this information, a [block explorer](../../../tools/developer-tools/block-explorers.mdx) is a powerful tool to understand how a contract is being used. Some explorer also allow to download the compiled contract as a WASM file. There are also projects providing a link to access the code itself.

In order to depend on a project, we at least need to know the contract address of the contract to depend on.

## On depending on another contract

Congratulations, now you can effectively leverage the whole Soroban ecosystem and it's diversity of smart contracts. There are one last point to discuss before closing up: dependability.

As with calling any smart contract in the first place, depending on an external smart contract should be done with care. It is well advised to do your own research and analysis on the contract you would want to use. As contracts can be updated without their address changing, it is important to pay close attention to any change on the underlying code.

Besides this security consideration, upgrading a contract is an integrand part of a contract's life cycle. New features are added, bugs are being fixed, and public API changes. Here as well, it is important to observe any development on these contract as to ensure a continuity of operation of your own contract.

## Examples

See the following full example:

- [Cross Contract Calls](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/cross-contract-call.mdx) shows how to create two contracts and call one from each other.
