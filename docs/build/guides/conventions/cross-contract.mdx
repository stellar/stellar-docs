title: Making Cross Contract Calls
description: Call a smart contract from within another smart contract
---

As with developing software in any language, developing a Soroban smart contract with a rich feature set can be a challenging and time-consuming task. Thankfully, someone else might already have solved part of your issues or build components which could be reused. The open source community is vibrant and Stellar's community does not disappoint.

There are two kind of dependencies which can be introduced in a Soroban smart contract.

1. Other Rust crates can be used (provided that they are compatible with Soroban's [Rust dialect](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/rust-dialect.mdx));
2. Other smart contract can be used. This is referred to as a [Cross-Contract](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/contract-interactions/cross-contract.mdx) call.

In the following, we will see how other contracts can be leveraged from within another contract.

## Contract as a dependency

While finding a contract is out of scope for this guide, there are a few place to be on a lookout. Most project and dApp are publicly disclosing on their website the address of their Soroban smart contract. With this information, a [block explorer](../../../tools/developer-tools/block-explorers.mdx) is a powerful tool to understand how a contract is being used. Some explorer also allow to download the compiled contract as a WASM file. There are also projects providing a link to access the code itself.

:::info[Contract address]

In order to depend on a project, we at least need to know the contract address of the contract to depend on.

## Examples

See the following full example:

- [Cross Contract Calls](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/cross-contract-call.mdx) shows how to create two contracts and call one from each other.
