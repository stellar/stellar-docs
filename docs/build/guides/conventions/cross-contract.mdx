title: Making Cross Contract Calls
description: Call a smart contract from within another smart contract
---

As with developing software in any language, developing a Soroban smart contract with a rich feature set can be a challenging and time-consuming task. Thankfully, someone else might already have solved part of your issues or build components which could be reused. The open source community is vibrant and Stellar's community does not disappoint.

There are two kind of dependencies which can be introduced in a Soroban smart contract.

1. Other Rust crates can be used (provided that they are compatible with Soroban's [Rust dialect](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/rust-dialect.mdx));
2. Other smart contract can be used. This is referred to as a [Cross-Contract](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/contract-interactions/cross-contract.mdx) call.

In the following, we will see how other contracts can be leveraged from within another contract.
