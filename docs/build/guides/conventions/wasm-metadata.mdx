The [`contractmeta!`] macro provided in the Rust SDK allows users to write two strings - a `key` and a `val` - within a serialized `SCMetaEntry::SCMetaV0` XDR object to the custom section of Wasm contracts. The section name for this metadata is `contractmetav0`. Developers can utilize this macro to write metadata, and tools can then read and display this information to users.

The [liquidity pool example] provides a clear demonstration of how to use the `contractmeta!` macro:

```rust
// Metadata that is added on to the Wasm custom section
contractmeta!(
    key = "Description",
    val = "Constant product AMM with a .3% swap fee"
);

pub trait LiquidityPoolTrait {...
```
