An event can contain topics, alongside the data it is publishing. The topics data can be any value or type you want.

```rust
// This function does nothing beside publishing events. Topics we are using are
// some `u32` integers for the sake of simplicity here.
pub fn events_function(env: Env) {
    // A symbol will be our `data` we want published
    my_data = Symbol::new(&env, "data_to_publish");

    // an event with 0 topics
    env.events().publish((), my_data.clone());

    // an event with 1 topic (Notice the extra comma after the topic in the
    // tuple? That comma is required in Rust to make a one-element tuple)
    env.events().publish((1u32,), my_data.clone());

    // an event with 2 topics
    env.events().publish((1u32, 2u32), my_data.clone());

    // an event with 3 topics
    env.events().publish((1u32, 2u32, 3u32), my_data.clone());

    // an event with 4 topics
    env.events().publish((1u32, 2u32, 3u32, 4u32), my_data.clone());
}
```

A more realistic example can be found in the way the [token interface] works. For example, the interface requires an event to be published every time the `transfer` function is invoked, with the following information:

```rust
pub fn transfer(env: Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    // transfer logic omitted here
    env.events().publish(
        (symbol_short!("transfer"), from, to),
        amount
    );
}
```
