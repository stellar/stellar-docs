Tests can assert on the auths that are expected to occur.

The following example sets up a test environment, registers an increment contract, and checks after the increment invocation what auths were required.

```rust
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let user_1 = Address::random(&env);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(&user_1, &5), 5);

    // highlight-start
    // Verify that the user indeed had to authorize a call of `increment` with
    // the expected arguments:
    assert_eq!(
        // Get the auths that were seen in the last invocation.
        env.auths(),
        std::vec![(
            // Address for which authorization check is performed
            user_1.clone(),
            // Invocation tree that needs to be authorized
            AuthorizedInvocation {
                // Function that is authorized. Can be a contract function or
                // a host function that requires authorization.
                function: AuthorizedFunction::Contract((
                    // Address of the called contract
                    contract_id.clone(),
                    // Name of the called function
                    symbol_short!("increment"),
                    // Arguments used to call `increment` (converted to the
                    // env-managed vector via `into_val`)
                    (user_1.clone(), 5_u32).into_val(&env),
                )),
                // The contract doesn't call any other contracts that require
                // authorization,
                sub_invocations: std::vec![]
            }
        )]
    );
    // highlight-end
}
```
