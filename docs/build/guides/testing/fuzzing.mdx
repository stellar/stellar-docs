Fuzzing is the process of providing random data to programs to identify unexpected behavior, such as crashes and panics.

Fuzz tests can also be written as property tests that instead of seeking to identify panics and crashes, assert on some property remaining true. Fuzzing as demonstrated here and elsewhere in these docs will use principles from both property testing and fuzzing, but will only use the term fuzzing to refer to both.

The following steps can be used in any Stellar contract workspace. If experimenting, try them in the [increment example]. The contract has an `increment` function that increases a counter value by one on every invocation.

## How to Write Fuzz Tests

1. Install `cargo-fuzz`.

   ```shell
   cargo install --locked cargo-fuzz
   ```

2. Initialize a fuzz project by running the following command inside your contract directory.

   ```shell
   cargo fuzz init
   ```

3. Open the contract's `Cargo.toml` file. Add `lib` as a `crate-type`.

   ```diff
    [lib]
   -crate-type = ["cdylib"]
   +crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]
   ```

4. Open the generated `fuzz/Cargo.toml` file. Add the `soroban-sdk` dependency.

   ```diff
    [dependencies]
    libfuzzer-sys = "0.4"
   +soroban-sdk = { version = "*", features = ["testutils"] }
   ```

5. Open the generated `fuzz/src/fuzz_target_1.rs` file. It will look like the below.

   ```rust
   #![no_main]
   use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

   fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
       // fuzzed code goes here
   });
   ```

6. Fill out the `fuzz_target!` call with test setup and assertions. For example, for the [increment example]:

   ```rust
   #![no_main]
   use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;
   use soroban_increment_with_fuzz_contract::{IncrementContract, IncrementContractClient};
   use soroban_sdk::{
       testutils::arbitrary::{self, Arbitrary},
       Env,
   };

   #[derive(Debug, Arbitrary)]
   pub struct Input {
       pub by: u64,
   }

   fuzz_target!(|input: Input| {
       let env = Env::default();
       let id = env.register(IncrementContract, ());
       let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &id);

       let mut last: Option<u32> = None;
       for _ in input.by.. {
           match client.try_increment() {
               Ok(Ok(current)) => assert!(Some(current) > last),
               Err(Ok(_)) => {} // Expected error
               Ok(Err(_)) => panic!("success with wrong type returned"),
               Err(Err(_)) => panic!("unrecognised error"),
           }
       }
   });
   ```

7. Execute the fuzz target.

   ```shell
   cargo +nightly fuzz run --sanitizer=thread fuzz_target_1
   ```

   :::info

   If you're developing on MacOS you need to add the `--sanitizer=thread` flag in order to work around a [known issue](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/1056).

   :::

This test uses the same patterns used in [unit tests] and [integration tests]:

1. Create an environment, the `Env`.
2. Register the contract to be tested.
3. Invoke functions using a client.
4. Assert expectations.

There is another tool for fuzzing Rust code, `cargo-afl`. See the [Rust Fuzz book] for a tutorial for how to use it.
