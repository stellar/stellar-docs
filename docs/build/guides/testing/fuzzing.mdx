Fuzzing is the process of providing random data to programs to identify unexpected behavior, such as crashes and panics.

Fuzz tests can also be written as property tests that instead of seeking to identify panics and crashes, assert on some property remaining true. Fuzzing as demonstrated here and elsewhere in these docs will use principles from both property testing and fuzzing, but will only use the term fuzzing to refer to both.

The following steps can be used in any Stellar contract workspace. If experimenting, try them in the [increment example]. The contract has an `increment` function that increases a counter value by one on every invocation.

## How to Write Fuzz Tests

1. Install the nightly Rust toolchain. Nightly Rust is required to run cargo-fuzz.

   ```
   rustup install nightly
   ```

2. Install `cargo-fuzz`.

   ```text
   cargo install --locked cargo-fuzz
   ```

3. Initialize a fuzz project by running the following command inside your contract directory.

   ```text
   cargo fuzz init
   ```

4. Open the contract's `Cargo.toml` file. Add `lib` as a `crate-type`.

   ```diff
    [lib]
   -crate-type = ["cdylib"]
   +crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]
   ```

5. Open the generated `fuzz/Cargo.toml` file. Add the `soroban-sdk` dependency.

   ```diff
    [dependencies]
    libfuzzer-sys = "0.4"
   +soroban-sdk = { version = "*", features = ["testutils"] }
   ```

6. Open the generated `fuzz/src/fuzz_target_1.rs` file. It will look like the below.

   ```rust
   #![no_main]
   use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

   fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
       // fuzzed code goes here
   });
   ```

7. Fill out the `fuzz_target!` call with test setup and assertions. For example, for the [increment example]:

   ```rust
   #![no_main]
   use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;
   use soroban_increment_with_fuzz_contract::{IncrementContract, IncrementContractClient};
   use soroban_sdk::{
       testutils::arbitrary::{arbitrary, Arbitrary},
       Env,
   };

   #[derive(Debug, Arbitrary)]
   pub struct Input {
       pub by: u64,
   }

   fuzz_target!(|input: Input| {
       let env = Env::default();
       let id = env.register(IncrementContract, ());
       let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &id);

       let mut last: Option<u32> = None;
       for _ in input.by.. {
           match client.try_increment() {
               Ok(Ok(current)) => assert!(Some(current) > last),
               Err(Ok(_)) => {} // Expected error
               Ok(Err(_)) => panic!("success with wrong type returned"),
               Err(Err(_)) => panic!("unrecognised error"),
           }
       }
   });
   ```

8. Execute the fuzz target.

   ```text
   cargo +nightly fuzz run --sanitizer=thread fuzz_target_1
   ```

   :::info

   If you're developing on MacOS you need to add the `--sanitizer=thread` flag in order to work around a [known issue](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/1056).

   :::

This test uses the same patterns used in [unit tests] and [integration tests]:

1. Create an environment, the `Env`.
2. Register the contract to be tested.
3. Invoke functions using a client.
4. Assert expectations.

There is another tool for fuzzing Rust code, `cargo-afl`. See the [Rust Fuzz book] for a tutorial for how to use it.

## How to Get Code Coverage of Fuzz Tests

Getting code coverage data for fuzz tests requires some different tooling than when doing the same for regular Rust tests.

1. Run the fuzz tests until it has produced a corpus, just as in step 7 above.

   ```text
   cargo +nightly fuzz run --sanitizer thread fuzz_target_1
   ```

2. Install the llvm-tools for the nightly compiler.

   ```text
   rustup component add --toolchain nightly llvm-tools-preview
   ```

3. Run the fuzz coverage command that'll execute the corpus and write coverage data to the coverage directory in the `profdata` format.

   ```text
   cargo +nightly fuzz coverage --sanitizer thread fuzz_target_1
   ```

4. Run the llvm-cov command to convert the profdata file to an lcov file.

   ```
   $(find $(rustc --print sysroot) -name llvm-cov) export \
       -instr-profile=fuzz/coverage/fuzz_target_1/coverage.profdata \
       -object target/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's|host: ||p')/coverage/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's|host: ||p')/release/fuzz_target_1 \
       --ignore-filename-regex "rustc" \
       -format=lcov \
       > lcov.info
   ```

   Load the `lcov.info` file into your IDE using its coverage feature. In VSCode this can be done by installing the [Coverage Gutters] extension and executing the `Coverage Gutters: Watch` command.

To measure code coverage of regular Rust tests, see [Code Coverage].
