Integration tests are tests that include the integration between components, and so test a larger scope such as other contracts.

The [Soroban Rust SDK] makes it just as easy to integration test by providing utilities for testing against real contracts fetched from mainnet, testnet, or the local file system.

## How to Write Integration Tests

The following is an example of a test that includes a dependency contract into the test, rather than mock it. The test is written to test the [increment-with-pause contract] and the [pause contract]. The contract has an `increment` function that increases a counter value by one on every invocation. The contract depends on the pause contract to control whether the increment functionality is paused.

The following tests set up the `increment-with-pause` contract, as well as import and register the real pause contract using it's wasm file.

1. Use the [stellar contract fetch] command to fetch the dependency contract that's already deployed on testnet or mainnet.

   ```shell
   stellar contract fetch --id C... > pause.wasm
   ```

2. Import the contract into the tests with the `contractimport!` macro.

   ```rust
   mod pause {
       soroban_sdk::contractimport!(file = "pause.wasm");
   }
   ```

3. Write a test similar to the following that registers not only the increment-with-pause contract, but also the pause contract that was imported. The test checks that when the pause contract is not paused that the increment contract operates as expected. When it is paused, the increment function errors. Once it's unpaused the function operates as expected.

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test() {
       let env = Env::default();

       // highlight-start
       let pause_id = env.register(pause::WASM, ());
       let pause_client = pause::Client::new(&env, &pause_id);
       // highlight-end

       let contract_id = env.register(
           IncrementContract,
           IncrementContractArgs::__constructor(&pause_id),
       );
       let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

       pause_client.set(&false);
       assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);

       pause_client.set(&true);
       assert_eq!(client.try_increment(), Err(Ok(Error::Paused)));

       pause_client.set(&false);
       assert_eq!(client.increment(), 2);
   }
   ```

Most tests, whether they're unit, mocks, or integration tests, will look very similar to the test above. The tests will do four things:

1. Create an environment, the `Env`.
2. Register the contract(s) to be tested.
3. Invoke functions using the generated client.
4. Assert the outcome.
