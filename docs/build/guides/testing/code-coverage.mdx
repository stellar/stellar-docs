Measuring code coverage uses tools to identify lines of code that are and aren't executed by tests. Code coverage stats can give us an idea of how much of a contract is actually tested by its tests.

:::tip

Mutation testing is another form of coverage testing. See [Mutation Testing].

:::

In rust projects the `cargo-llvm-cov` tool can be used to generate coverage stats, HTML reports, and lcov files that IDEs will load to display the coverage in the code editor.

Install `cargo-llvm-cov` before proceeding with the other commands.

```
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

## How to Get Coverage Stats

Run the test subcommand that will run the tests and output the stats per file.

```
cargo llvm-cov test
```

## How to Generate a Coverage Report with Code

Run the test subcommand that will run the tests and output a set of HTML files showing which lines of code are covered.

```
cargo llvm-cov test --html --open
```

The output of the command will indicate where the HTML file has been written. Open the file in a browser.

## How to Generate an LCOV File for IDEs

Run the test subcommand that will run the tests and output a single `lcov.info` file.

```
cargo llvm-cov test --lcov --output-path=lcov.info
```

Load the `lcov.info` file into your IDE using its coverage feature. In VSCode this can be done by installing the [Coverage Gutters] extension and executing the `Coverage Gutters: Watch` command.

:::info

Measuring code coverage in fuzz tests requires different tooling. See [Fuzzing].
