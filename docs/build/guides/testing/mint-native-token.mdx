It can often be necessary to test whether your contract's interactions surrounding tokens work as intended. Often, the token you test again can be created from arbitrary details. However, there are occassions where testing against a specific token can be advantageous. Here is a test function that makes use of the Stellar Asset Contract for the native XLM token.

```rust
env.token.native_asset_contract(); // or some such...
```
