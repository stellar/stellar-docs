This guide picks up where [Build a Dapp Frontend](../../apps/dapp-frontend.mdx) left off. From there, we'll:

1. Search GitHub for other Soroban templates
1. Build our own simple template

Building our own template will be a great way to learn how they work. They're not that complicated!

## Search GitHub for other Soroban templates

The official template maintained by Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), as used in [Build a Dapp Frontend](../../apps/dapp-frontend.mdx), lives on GitHub at [stellar/soroban-template-astro](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template). It uses the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework. While Astro works with React, Vue, Svelte, and any other UI library, the template opts not to use them, preferring Astro's own templating language, which uses vanilla JavaScript with no UI library.

(You may wonder why it makes this unpopular choice. A fair question! The team wanted to balance actual utility with broad approachability. Not everyone learning Stellar and Soroban is familiar with React, or any other UI library. It also demonstrates that core Soroban libraries all work with any JavaScript project.)

To use other templates, we will clone them from their repositories, and then copy these files into the root of the existing `soroban-hello-world` directory:

```bash
# For example, you could clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Now copy files into the root of `soroban-hello-world`.

So how can you find other valid frontend templates?

At some point we may set up a DAO or other voting system to curate a list of high-quality templates, but for now... search GitHub! And GitLab. And any other source code site you know about.

In GitHub, in the main search bar, search for `"soroban-template-"`. With the quotes. Here's a direct link to the search results: [github.com/search?q=%22soroban-template-%22](https://github.com/search?q=%22soroban-template-%22)

You can copy this approach for any other source code website, such as GitLab.

How do you know if any of these are any good? Try them. Look at their source code. How many stars do they have? How active are their maintainers? None of these are perfect metrics, which is why a curated registry might be nice in the future.

If none of them suit, then it might be time to...

## Make your own template

This will be easier than you might imagine. There are a few gotchas, but overall these templates are fairly standard Node projects.

### But first, how are these projects organized?

When you run `stellar contract init`, it _always_ includes a Rust/Cargo project, with a `Cargo.toml` that defines a workspace, and workspace members located in a `contracts` folder. At a minimum, there's one contract, `contracts/hello_world`, but you can get more by using `--name`.

So keep that in mind. We're making a fairly simple Node project, and telling it about our Soroban stuff, like the `contracts` folder.

### 1. Initialize an NPM project

So let's make a simple Node project! Rather than initializing an Astro project, like the official frontend template, let's try something new. The [State of JS survey](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_experience_linechart) tells me that something called "Solid" is fairly new and well-loved. [What does it say to do?](https://www.solidjs.com/)

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/ts soroban-template-solid
cd soroban-template-solid
npm install
npm run dev
```

Ok, we have a running Solid template! Now let's turn it into a Soroban template!

### 2. git init

Commit early, commit often! You can stop running the dev server (the one you started with `npm run dev` above; stop it with <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd>, even on a Mac) if you want, or open a new terminal and:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init from solid ts template"
```

### 3. Copy in the `initialize.js` script

The SDF-maintained `soroban-template-astro` has [an `initialize.js` script](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template/blob/main/initialize.js) in its project root. Copy-paste it into your project.

If you're familiar with Node scripting, you should be able to figure out what it's doing. If not, it's a great way to learn! Tip: start at the bottom, where it does the `generateAccount(); buildAll(); deployAll();` stuff.

That stuff at the end should give you a clue about what this script does. It does stuff that a _Soroban_ app needs. Soroban apps make calls to Soroban.

So this script:

1. generates a Soroban/Stellar account
2. builds all contracts
3. deploys all contracts (to a locally-running Soroban network; we'll recap this soon)
4. _binds_ contracts — that is, it creates NPM projects for each deployed contract by running `stellar contract bindings typescript`
5. imports the contracts for straightforward use in the rest of your project

Remember that it needs to do this all _in a contract-agnostic way_. The frontend template doesn't know what contracts it might find! But it needs to build, deploy, bind, and import whatever's there.

So this script does that.

But it needs a few other things.

#### A. `devDependencies`

The script uses a couple NPM packages. Install them:

```bash
npm install --save-dev dotenv glob
```

#### B. `.env`

The [`dotenv` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) installed above parses environment variables from a `.env` file. The official template includes [a `.env.example`](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template/blob/main/.env.example). Go ahead and copy it into your own project. To set you up for testing it all out, you can also copy it to a local `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### C. `.gitignore`

You'll want to ignore the `.env` file you created above, as well as some other build artifacts created by the `initialize.js` script. Paste the bottom of [the official template's `.gitignore`](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template/blob/main/.gitignore) into your template's `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# environment variables
.env
.env.production

# generated contract clients
packages/*
# if you have other workspace packages, add them here
!packages/.gitkeep

# generated contract client imports
src/contracts/*
!src/contracts/util.ts
```

#### C. `package.json`

Make sure users of your template don't forget to run the `initialize.js` script. Modify the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff
-    "start": "vite",
-    "dev": "vite",
-    "build": "vite build",
-    "serve": "vite preview"
+    "init": "node initialize.js",
+    "start": "npm run init && vite",
+    "dev": "npm run init && vite",
+    "build": "npm run init && vite build",
+    "serve": "npm run init && vite preview"
```

Alternatively, rather than adding the repetitive `npm run init` statements, you could opt to add [a `postinstall` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-operation-order) where you `npm run init`, or just `node initialize.js` in there.

You also need to tell NPM to treat this as a workspace. Yes, this project is a Cargo workspace _and_ an NPM workspace! The `bindAll` step of `initialize.js` puts the generated NPM packages in `packages/*`. At the bottom of `package.json`, add:

```diff
   "dependencies": {
     "solid-js": "^1.8.11"
-  }
+  },
+  "workspaces": [
+    "packages/*"
+  ]
}
```

Also make sure that this project is set up to allow the `import` statements in the `initialize.js` script. Add this at the top-level:

```diff
   "description": "",
+  "type": "module",
   "scripts": {
```

While you're here, you can also update the `name` (maybe `"soroban-template-solid"`) and `description`.

#### E. `src/contracts/util.ts`

In the `.gitignore` above, you may have noticed that this file is explicitly included. Copy it in from [the official template](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template/blob/main/src/contracts/util.ts). You'll need to create the `src/contracts` folder.

As you can see, it just makes it easy to `import { rpcUrl, networkPassphrase } from 'util'` in the files generated in the `importAll` step.

#### F. README

You might want to start by copying [the official template's README](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template/blob/main/README.md) to explain how to `cp .env.example .env`. From there, this might also be a good time to explain anything else that makes your template unique! Why might people want to use it?

### 4. `git commit`

Commit changes!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "add initialize.js script and supporting changes"
```

### 5. Try it!

That's it! You have an NPM project with an `initialize.js` script (and its supporting cast). That's all you really need!

Let's try it. First, make sure you're running a local Stellar network. Start Docker Desktop or whatever alternative you prefer, then:

```bash
stellar network container start local
```

Let's include one extra contract. Go to [the increment example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/increment) and copy increment files into the root directory.

Then we'll run the `dev` script (which, remember, will run the `initialize.js` script firs).

```bash
npm run dev
```

After you do this, you may notice lots of new changes in the project. All that Rust, Cargo, and Soroban stuff!

```bash
$ git status --short

?? .soroban/
?? Cargo.lock
?? Cargo.toml
?? contracts/
?? target/
```

Q: Should you commit this stuff?<br />A: **_NO!_**

Q: Should you _gitignore_ this stuff?<br />A: **_NO!_**

The `.soroban` and `target` folders [are gitignored by the core Rust/Cargo template](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/blob/main/cmd/soroban-cli/src/utils/contract-init-template/.gitignore). In projects that specify yours as their `--frontend-template`, that `.gitignore` will be merged with yours. No need to include those lines twice.

And projects that use yours will want to commit the `Cargo.*` files and `contracts`, but your _template_ should not include them. That can cause problems with project initialization later. Nor should it gitignore them, because your `.gitignore` will be part of projects started with your template! It would cause problems and confusion, if people didn't realize that some of their most important files were gitignored!

Alright. Go ahead and open the app in your browser. Solid runs its dev server on `http://localhost:3000`. Does it load? It should! We didn't actually use the new `src/contracts/*` stuff in the app itself!

### 6. Wait. Should the template actually use the contracts?

Good question!

You know that the `hello_world` contract will always be there. So you could demonstrate to your users how to import and use it in an app file (like `src/App.tsx`, in the Solid template). But remember: no other contracts are guaranteed to be there! So don't commit any changes that import and use something like `increment`!

Here's a way you could demonstrate how to import and use the `hello_world` contract in the Solid template's `App.tsx`:

```diff
+import greeter from "./contracts/hello_world";

 const App: Component = () => {
   return (
     <div class={styles.App}>
       <header class={styles.header}>
+        <form
+          onSubmit={async (e) => {
+            e.preventDefault();
+            const { result } = await greeter.hello({
+              to: e.currentTarget.toWhom.value,
+            });
+            alert(result);
+          }}
+        >
+          <label>
+            Who you gonna call? &nbsp;
+            <input name="toWhom" value="World" /> &nbsp;
+          </label>
+          <button type="submit">Say Hello</button>
+        </form>
```

### 7. Make it as complex as you want!

This is _your_ template. Go ahead and add helpful dependencies and utility files that you always want, like wallet management or whatever. If you want to add a whole complex stack of UI components, styles, and state-management libraries, go ahead!

The official template strives for simplicity. For shallowness, even. It's meant as a teaching tool, for people with all different levels of JS and Soroban experience. Yours has no such constraints! It should be useful to _you_.

And templates are cheap to make! If you want to have one `soroban-template-framework-x-basic` for a broader audience, and another `soroban-template-framework-x-opinionated` for your own projects, you can do that!

## Wrapping up

Some things we did in this section:

- Searched GitHub for new frontend templates
- Learned that some templates might not be on GitHub
- Saw how frontend templates work and interact with the "backend" template that always comes with `stellar contract init`
- Built our own template by adding an `initialize.js` script to a basic NPM template

After you're done building your own frontend template, what's next? You choose! You can:

- See more complex example contracts in the [Example Contracts](../../smart-contracts/example-contracts/README.mdx) section.
- Learn more about the [internal architecture and design](../../../learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/README.mdx) of Soroban.
