When setting up an example Soroban Dapp, correct initialization is crucial. This process entails several steps, including deploying Docker, cloning and deploying smart contracts, and invoking functions to configure them. In this comprehensive guide, you will walk you through the necessary steps to successfully build and deploy these smart contracts, ensuring a seamless setup for your Soroban Dapp.

## Building the Soroban Token Smart Contract

In dapps like the [Example Payment Dapp](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-react-payment/), the [Soroban Token smart contracts](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/token) are used to represent the tokenized asset that users can send and receive. Here is an example of how to build and deploy the Soroban Token smart contracts:

Start by cloning the Soroban examples repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples.git
```

Then, navigate to the `token` directory:

```shell
cd soroban-examples/token
```

At this point you can build the smart contract:

```shell
make
```

This action will compile the smart contracts and place them in the `token/target/wasm32v1-none/release` directory. After building, you're ready to deploy the smart contracts to Testnet.

## Deploying and Initializing the Soroban Token Smart Contract

The smart contract can be initialized at deploy-time by utilizing the `__constructor` function. This function will be called at deploy-time and can be declared with parameters you can pass to the function with the deploy command.

The `__constructor` function is added to the contract entry point, in this `token` smart contract it is found in the [contract.rs](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/main/token/src/contract.rs) file.

```rust title="contract.rs"
#[contractimpl]
impl Token {
  pub fn __constructor(e: Env, admin: Address, decimal: u32, name: String, symbol: String) {
      if decimal > 18 {
          panic!("Decimal must not be greater than 18");
      }
      write_administrator(&e, &admin);
      write_metadata(
          &e,
          TokenMetadata {
              decimal,
              name,
              symbol,
          },
      )
  }
  ...
}
```

The `__constructor` function in this example project takes the following parameters:

- Administrator Account: This is the public key of the administrator account. The administrator has control and authority over the token contract, enabling management of various contract functionalities. Learn more about the administrator's role from the Soroban Token Interface.

- Decimal Precision: The decimal precision specifies the maximum number of decimal places the token can support transactions up to. This precision level enables flexibility when transferring token amounts.

- Token Name: The token's name.

- Token Symbol: This is the token's symbol.

To deploy the smart contract in this example, open a terminal in the `soroban-examples/token` directory and execute the following:

```shell
stellar contract deploy \
 --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
 --source-account alice \
 --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
 --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015'
 -- \
 --admin alice \
 --decimal 10 \
 --name 'Demo Token' \
 --symbol 'DT'
```

This command deploys the smart contracts to Testnet using the `stellar contract deploy` function. The smart contract will be deployed with the mandatory parameters, and the smart contract will be initialized with these values.

## Minting Tokens

Lastly, you need to mint some tokens to the sender's account:

```shell
stellar contract invoke \
 --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
 --source-account alice \
 --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
 --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015'
 -- mint \
 --to bob \
 --amount 1000000000
```

This command will mint 100 tokens to the designated user's account, in this case `bob`.

By following these steps, you ensure that the Soroban token smart contracts are correctly deployed and initialized, setting the stage for the Dapp to effectively interact with the token.
