When developing decentralized applications using soroban, state archival is part of what we need to consider due to how data is stored on the stellar network. This guide will help you understand what state archival is and how to work with it in your DApp.

## What is State Archival?

State archival in Stellar decentralized applications (dApps) is a crucial process for managing the lifecycle and accessibility of contract data and code on the blockchain. It revolves around the concept of Time To Live (TTL), where each data entry - whether `Persistent`, `Temporary`, or `Instance` - has a countdown to inaccessibility. When an entry's TTL reaches zero, it becomes either archived or deleted, depending on its type. `Temporary` data is permanently removed, while `Persistent` and `Instance` data become inaccessible but can be restored.

This system allows for efficient blockchain resource management by enabling temporary data to expire and be removed, while providing mechanisms to keep important data accessible long-term. Developers must actively manage their data's lifecycle by extending TTLs and restoring archived data when necessary. The process applies not only to contract data but also to contract instances and their associated WebAssembly (WASM) code. Different storage types have varying costs and archival behaviors, allowing developers to optimize based on their specific needs. Ultimately, state archival requires careful consideration in dApp design and ongoing maintenance to ensure continued functionality.
