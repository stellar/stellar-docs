description: Create a Stellar account on Testnet with Freighter
---

1. Install the Freighter [browser extension](https://www.freighter.app).

2. Create a keypair or import an existing account using a mnemonic phrase to complete setup.

3. Next, switch to Testnet. Testnet is available from the network dropdown.

4. If your account does not exist on the selected network, Freighter will prompt you to fund it the account using Friendbot. Alternatively, you can do so in the [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org/account/create).
