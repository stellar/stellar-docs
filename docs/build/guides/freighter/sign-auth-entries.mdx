description: Use Freighter's API to sign an authorization entry
---

In order to take advantage of [contract authorization](../../../learn/encyclopedia/security/authorization.mdx), you can use Freighter's API to sign an authorization entry. A good example of how signing an authorization entry works can be found in the [`authorizeEntry` helper of `stellar-sdk`](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/blob/e3d6fc3351e7d242b374c7c6057668366364a279/src/auth.js#L97).

Like in the helper, you can construct a [`HashIdPreimageSorobanAuthorization`](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/blob/a9567e5843760bfb6a8b786592046aee4c9d38b2/types/next.d.ts#L6895) and use the xdr representation of that structure to call `await freighterApi.signAuthEntry(preimageXdr)`. This call will return a `Buffer` of the signed hash of the `HashIdPreimageSorobanAuthorization` passed in, which can then be used to submit to the network during a contract authorization workflow.

For a full example of how to use contract authorization, [the scaffold-soroban demo for an atomic swap](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-react-atomic-swap) makes use of both contract auth and Freighter's `signAuthEntry` API.
