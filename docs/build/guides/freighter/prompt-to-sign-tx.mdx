description: Sign smart contract transactions using the Freighter browser extension

If you're building a JS dapp, easily sign Soroban transactions using the [Freighter browser extension](https://www.freighter.app/) and its corresponding client library [@stellar/freighter-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/freighter-api):

1. Follow the setup instructions to [connect to the Testnet](./connect-testnet.mdx), if required during development.

2. Now, you can use the `signTransaction` [method](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/guide/usingFreighterWebApp) from `@stellar/freighter-api` in your dapp to sign Soroban XDRs using the account in Freighter.

3. Upon calling `signTransaction`, Freighter will open and prompt the user to sign the transaction. Approving the transaction will return an object containing the signed XDR to the requesting dapp.
