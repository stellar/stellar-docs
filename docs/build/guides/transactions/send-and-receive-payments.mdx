## Payments Overview

A payment constitutes the transfer of a token from one account to another. On Stellar network a token can be either a Stellar asset or a contract token.

There are two primary ways payments are transacted on Stellar:
- Using Stellar's payment-related [operations](/docs/learn/fundamentals/transactions/list-of-operations) 
- [Invoking a function](/docs/learn/fundamentals/contract-development/contract-interactions/overview) on a token contract.

The approach you should take depends on the use case:
  - If you want to make a payment of a Stellar asset between two Stellar accounts, use the payment operations. Transaction fees are cheaper when using them compared to the fees for invoking the token contract for the asset directly which is referred to as the [Stellar Asset Contract](/docs/tokens/stellar-asset-contract#overview).
  - If you want to make a payment of a Stellar asset between a Stellar account and a contract address, or between two contract addresses, then the asset's contract must be used. Stellar's payment-related operations cannot have contract addresses as their source or destination.
  - If you want to make a payment of a contract token (not a Stellar asset), you must use the token's contract. Stellar's payment operations can only be used to transfer Stellar assets.

To learn more about the differences between Stellar assets and contract tokens, see the [Tokens](../../../../docs/tokens) overview.

In the following code samples, proper error checking is omitted for brevity. However, you should _always_ validate your results, as there are many ways that requests can fail.

## Using Payments Example
This example highlights the approach mentioned for transacting payments using operations and assets and using the [Stellar RPC](../../../data/apis/rpc/README.mdx) with [Stellar Client SDKs](/docs/tools/sdks/client-sdks#overview) to perform all actions needed. 

### Send a Payment
Lets demonstrate a payment of an asset on Stellar. We will build a transaction with a payment operation to send 10 Lummens from a sender account to a receiver account, sign it as the sender account, and submit it to the network.
- Submitting the transaction to the SDF-maintained public testnet instance of Stellar RPC server. 
- When submitting transactions to the RPC server it's possible that you will not receive a response from the server due to network conditions. 
  - In such a situation it's impossible to determine the status of your transaction. 
  - Highlights a recommendation to always save a transaction (or transaction encoded in XDR format) in a variable or a database and resubmit it if you don't know its status. 
  - The transaction in serialized XDR format is idempotent meaning if the transaction has already been successfully applied to the ledger, RPC will simply return the saved result and not attempt to submit the transaction again. 
  - Only in cases where a transaction's status is unknown (and thus will have a chance of being included into a ledger) will a resubmission to the network occur.

### Monitoring Payments as event stream

Leverage the latest [Protocol 23 (Whisk)](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/introducing-whisk-stellar-protocol-23) to capture payment activity as pure events. These events can be efficiently monitored using the RPC server's `getEvents` method, which provides server-side filtering and real-time payment detection.

The RPC approach offers several advantages:
- **Server-side event topic filtering**: Filter for specific events using topic patterns
- **Efficient polling**: Use cursors and pagination for reliable event processing
- **Unified event model**: supports [CAP-67](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0067.md), all asset movements on the network are emitted as events with standardized topic names to indicate the type of movement (e.g., "transfer" for payments)
- **Better error handling**: RPC stateless HTTP polling is more resilient than persistent streaming protocols like SSE or WebSockets

Demonstrate near real-time monitoring of transactions from the Stellar network by establishing an asynchronous listener to consume events from RPC and filter them by topic for just our example payments generated by our previous payments script.

    // Get starting ledger

### Running Your Payment Pipeline with RPC

1. **Run the payment submission script** in one terminal. Leave it running, it will submit a payment once every 30 seconds.
<Details summary="Click for command to run the payments">
<CodeExample>

```bash
// js
node send_payment.js
```

</CodeExample>
</Details>

2. **Run the payment monitor script** in a separate terminal.
<Details summary="Click for command to run the payments monitor">
<CodeExample>

```bash
// js
node monitor_payments.js
```

</CodeExample>
</Details>

3. **Observe the payment events** as they're detected and displayed on console.

## Summary

- Payments from transaction operations or contract invocations on Stellar network can be monitored by leveraging the unified events model as of [Protocol 23 (Whisk)](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/introducing-whisk-stellar-protocol-23) and the RPC `getEvents` method.

  - **Payments are 'transfer' events**: the [unified events model](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0067.md) ensures whether a payment happened through an operation or contract invocation it will result in the same 'transfer' event being emitted.
  - **Event Type**: `"contract"` denotes payments are an application level event rather than 'diagnostic' or 'system' event.
  - **Transfer Topics Model**: an array of four topics, specified in [CAP-67](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0067.md) and summarized:
    - `topic[0]` = Event name 'transfer' determines the next 3 topics
    - `topic[1]` = Transfer Sender address
    - `topic[2]` = Transfer Recipient address
    - `topic[3]` = Asset identifier

- RPC provides precise filtering of Stellar network events and this includes event topics model defined for unified events in [CAP-67](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0067.md). You save time by using the RPC server-side filter capabilities to focus on processing only events relative to your application such as payments from a specific account in this example.
  - **Wildcards**: The RPC `getEvents` allows to use "\*" to match any value in a topic position
  - **Server-side Filtering**: RPC `getEvents` applies the filters and only matching events are returned, reducing bandwidth
  - **Cursor-based Pagination**: RPC `getEvents` retrieves event data efficiently with a paging mechanism
