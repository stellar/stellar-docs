description: Use a looping mechanism to submit a transaction to the RPC
---

Here is a simple, rudimentary looping mechanism to submit a transaction to Stellar RPC and wait for a result.

```typescript
import {
  Transaction,
  FeeBumpTransaction,
  SorobanRpc,
} from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { Server, Api } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/rpc";

const RPC_SERVER = "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org/";
const server = new Server(RPC_SERVER);

// Submits a tx and then polls for its status until a timeout is reached.
async function yeetTx(
  tx: Transaction | FeeBumpTransaction,
): Promise<Api.GetTransactionResponse> {
  return server.sendTransaction(tx).then(async (reply) => {
    if (reply.status !== "PENDING") {
      throw reply;
    }

    let status;
    let attempts = 0;
    while (attempts++ < 5) {
      const tmpStatus = await server.getTransaction(reply.hash);
      switch (tmpStatus.status) {
        case Api.GetTransactionStatus.FAILED:
          throw tmpStatus;
        case Api.GetTransactionStatus.NOT_FOUND:
          await sleep(500);
          continue;
        case Api.GetTransactionStatus.SUCCESS:
          status = tmpStatus;
          break;
      }
    }

    if (attempts >= 5 || !status) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to find transaction ${reply.hash} in time.`);
    }

    return status;
  });
}

function sleep(ms: number) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

:::caution

Remember: You should always handle errors gracefully! This is a fail-hard and fail-fast approach that should only be used in these examples.
