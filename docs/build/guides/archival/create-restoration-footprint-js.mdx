description: Manually set up a restoration footprint with JavaScript SDK

Let's create a utility method named `createRestorationFootprint` used for creating manually a restoration footprint and restore archived data in a contract.

But first let's revisit shortly how data is stored in a smart contract with the 3 different state archival types:

| Temporary | Instance | Persistent |
|----------|----------|----------|
| cheapest option    | expensive option   | expensive option   |
|  not archived after TTL expires    | archived when TTL reaches `0`   | archived when TTL reaches `0`  |
| cannot be restored    | can be restored using the `RestoreFootprintOp` operation   | can be restored using the `RestoreFootprintOp` operation   |
| unlimited amount of storage | limited amount of storage available | unlimited amount of storage |

As seen above, all contract data is automatically archived when TTL reaches `0`, except for `Temporary` entries which are deleted permanently from ledger.

Both types `Instance` and `Persistent` are suitable for storing data that cannot be easily recreated, with the nuance that `Instance` shares the same TTL as the contract instance while `Persistent` does not and, if the contract instance is not archived, `Persistent` data may be archived and need to be restored before invoking the contract.

For detailed explanation of contract data is archived, check out our Encyclopedia under the Storage section, chapter [State Archival](./../../../learn/encyclopedia/storage/state-archival.mdx)
```typescript
import {
    Contract,
    Networks,
    Keypair,
    Operation,
    TransactionBuilder,
    xdr, Address, Account, Transaction,
} from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

async function createRestorationFootprint(account: Account, contractAddress: string, fee: string, dataKey: xdr.ScVal, signer: Keypair) {

    // Initialise contract & address
    const contract: Contract = new Contract(contractAddress);
    const address: Address = Address.fromString(contract.contractId());
    // Setup contract data
    const contractDataXDR = xdr.LedgerKey.contractData(
        new xdr.LedgerKeyContractData({
            contract: address.toScAddress(),
            key: dataKey,
            durability: xdr.ContractDataDurability.persistent(),
        })
    );
    // Prepare transaction data
    const restoreData: xdr.SorobanTransactionData = new xdr.SorobanTransactionData({
        resources: new xdr.SorobanResources({
            footprint: new xdr.LedgerFootprint({
                readOnly: [],
                readWrite: [contractDataXDR],
            }),
            instructions: 0,
            readBytes: 0,
            writeBytes: 0,
        }),
        resourceFee: xdr.Int64.fromString('0'),
        // @ts-ignore
        ext: new xdr.ExtensionPoint(0),
    });
    // Restore transaction with created restoration footprint
    const restoreTx: Transaction = new TransactionBuilder(account, {fee: fee})
        .setNetworkPassphrase(Networks.TESTNET)
        .setSorobanData(restoreData)
        .addOperation(Operation.restoreFootprint({}))
        .build();

    restoreTx.sign(signer);
}
```

## Code walkthrough

- As we're making use of [Stellar SDK for JavaScript](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/) `js-stellar-sdk`, first we import the module
- Our function will require the following parameters:
    - `account`: The Stellar account from which the transaction will be sent.
    - `contractAddress`: The address of the contract to be restored.
    - `fee`: The fee for the transaction.
    - `dataKey`: The key for the contract data to be restored.
    - `signer`: The keypair that will sign the transaction.
- After we initialise contract and address instances, we create an XDR representation of the contract data which includes:
    - `contract`: The contract address.
    - `key`: The key for the contract data.
    - `durability`: Specifies that the contract data is persistent - we assume it's `Persistent`
- Next up we are preparing the (Soroban) transaction data with:
resources: Specifies the resources needed for the transaction.
    - `footprint`: Defines which parts of the ledger will be read and written.
    - `instructions`, `readBytes`, `writeBytes`: Sets the resource limits (all set to 0 here).
    - `resourceFee`: Sets the resource fee to 0 (placeholder).
    - `ext`: Extension point for future use (set to 0).
- Note that for restoration footprints we only need to fill in `reaWrite`.
- The transaction can now be submitted to the Stellar (test) network & signed to restore the specified contractâ€™s data.
