description: Manually set up a restoration footprint with JavaScript SDK

In this guide, we'll create a utility method named `createRestorationFootprint` used for manually creating a restoration footprint and restore archived data in a contract.

First let's revisit how data is stored in a smart contract with the three different state archival types:

| Temporary | Instance | Persistent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cheapest option | Expensive option | Expensive option |
| Deleted after TTL reaches `0` | Archived when TTL reaches `0` | Archived when TTL reaches `0` |
| Cannot be restored | Can be restored using the `RestoreFootprintOp` operation | Can be restored using the `RestoreFootprintOp` operation |
| Unlimited amount of storage | Limited amount of storage available | Unlimited amount of storage |

As seen above, all contract data is automatically archived when TTL reaches `0`, except for `Temporary` entries, which are deleted permanently from the ledger.

Both types `Instance` and `Persistent` are suitable for storing data that cannot be easily recreated, with the nuance that `Instance` shares the same TTL as the contract instance while `Persistent` does not and, if the contract instance is not archived, `Persistent` data may be archived and need to be restored before invoking the contract.

For a detailed explanation of contract data archival, check out the [State Archival section](./../../../learn/encyclopedia/storage/state-archival.mdx) in the Encyclopedia.

```typescript
import {
  Contract,
  Networks,
  Keypair,
  Operation,
  TransactionBuilder,
  xdr,
  Address,
  Account,
  Transaction,
} from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

async function createRestorationFootprint(
  account: Account,
  contractAddress: string,
  fee: string,
  dataKey: xdr.ScVal,
  signer: Keypair,
) {
  // Initialise contract & address
  const contract: Contract = new Contract(contractAddress);
  const address: Address = Address.fromString(contract.contractId());
  // Setup contract data
  const contractDataXDR = xdr.LedgerKey.contractData(
    new xdr.LedgerKeyContractData({
      contract: address.toScAddress(),
      key: dataKey,
      durability: xdr.ContractDataDurability.persistent(),
    }),
  );
  // Prepare transaction data
  const restoreData: xdr.SorobanTransactionData =
    new xdr.SorobanTransactionData({
      resources: new xdr.SorobanResources({
        footprint: new xdr.LedgerFootprint({
          readOnly: [],
          readWrite: [contractDataXDR],
        }),
        instructions: 0,
        readBytes: 0,
        writeBytes: 0,
      }),
      resourceFee: xdr.Int64.fromString("0"),
      // @ts-ignore
      ext: new xdr.ExtensionPoint(0),
    });
  // Restore transaction with created restoration footprint
  const restoreTx: Transaction = new TransactionBuilder(account, { fee: fee })
    .setNetworkPassphrase(Networks.TESTNET)
    .setSorobanData(restoreData)
    .addOperation(Operation.restoreFootprint({}))
    .build();

  restoreTx.sign(signer);
}
```

## Code walkthrough

As we're making use of [Stellar SDK for JavaScript](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/) `js-stellar-sdk`, first we import the module.

Our function will require the following parameters:

- `account`: The Stellar account from which the transaction will be sent.
- `contractAddress`: The address of the contract to be restored.
- `fee`: The fee for the transaction.
- `dataKey`: The key for the contract data to be restored.
- `signer`: The keypair that will sign the transaction.

After we initialize contract and address instances, we create an XDR representation of the contract data which includes:

- `contract`: The contract address.
- `key`: The key for the contract data.
- `durability`: Specifies that the contract data is persistent - we assume it's `Persistent`.

Next up we are preparing the (Soroban) transaction data with:

- `resources`: Specifies the resources needed for the transaction.
- `footprint`: Defines which parts of the ledger will be read and written.
- `instructions`, `readBytes`, `writeBytes`: Sets the resource limits (all set to 0 here).
- `resourceFee`: Sets the resource fee to 0 (placeholder).
- `ext`: Extension point for future use (set to 0).

Note that for restoration footprints we only need to fill in `reaWrite`.

The transaction can now be submitted to the Stellar (test) network & signed to restore the specified contractâ€™s data.
