Smart wallets are contract accounts that act as user wallets. They hold assets and enforce authorization in `__check_auth` instead of a single secret key. Passkeys (WebAuthn) are common, but you can also use Ed25519 keys, policy signers, session keys or anything the contract can verify.

## When to use a smart wallet

- You need programmable authorization (limits, allow lists, multi-factor approvals such as user plus device key).
- You want a passkey or hardware key experience without exposing seed phrases.
- You need flexible signer mixes: passkeys for UX, Ed25519 for compatibility, policy or multisig signers for risk controls.

## WebAuthn

[WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) is a browser standard for passwordless authentication using public key cryptography. A device creates a keypair and proves possession with a challenge/response flow. Keys stay on the device or synced across devices through cloud providers.

Benefits:

- Works across modern browsers and platforms.
- Familiar flows (Touch ID, Face ID, hardware keys) without seed phrases.
- Produces signatures you verify in `__check_auth`.

## secp256r1 on Stellar

`secp256r1` (prime256v1) is the curve most WebAuthn authenticators use. Stellar added native verification for this curve in Protocol 21, so contracts can validate WebAuthn signatures on chain.

## Passkeys

- WebAuthn is the browser standard for passwordless auth.
- secp256r1 is the curve most authenticators use; Stellar verifies it on-chain.
- Passkeys are the platform or hardware-backed credentials that implement WebAuthn.
- See [examples](./examples.mdx) for real projects.

## Passkeys in practice

- Registration: use WebAuthn to create a device keypair; store the public key (and optional credential ID) in contract state.
- Signing: request a WebAuthn assertion when the user approves an action; it returns a signature over the payload.
- Verification: pass the signature and credential ID to your contract; in `__check_auth`, verify the secp256r1 signature and apply any policy checks (limits, allow lists, timelocks).
