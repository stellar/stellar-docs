# Why use sponsorship

Both **Classic** and **Smart Wallets** on the Stellar Network require **XLM** to be created and used, primarily to cover [fees](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering) and reserve requirements.

- **Classic wallets** must maintain a minimum **[base reserve](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts#base-reserves)** of XLM to exist on the ledger.
- **Smart wallets** (e.g., contract-based `C` accounts) don’t require a base reserve, but they **incur fees** for contract deployment, ledger writes, and interactions.

In both cases, wallets need to pay **fees** for operations such as transfers, contract calls, or trustline management.

### The Onboarding Challenge

If users are responsible for covering these costs, onboarding requires them to either **acquire XLM** or **receive it from an external source**, adding friction and complexity to users. To streamline the user experience, applications often aim to abstract this away so users don’t need to understand or even be aware of XLM.

### Why Direct Funding Isn't Safe

One option is to send XLM directly to a user’s wallet to cover creation and usage costs. However, this approach is **vulnerable to abuse**: malicious users could automate wallet creation and drain funds by creating multiple accounts.

### Sponsorship Mechanisms

Stellar provides **native fee and reserve sponsorship** for Classic wallets, enabling applications to cover costs securely:

- **Fee Sponsorship** lets an application pay transaction fees on behalf of the user.
- **Reserve Sponsorship** lets an app lock the required XLM for account or trustline creation, _without transferring it_ to the user.

This model avoids giving users direct control over XLM and protects the application from misuse, while enabling a seamless onboarding flow.

On the other hand, Smart wallets don't require a base reserve, but they incur fees for contract deployment, ledger writes, and interactions. Tools like [Launchtube](https://github.com/stellar/launchtube) can be used to make this process easier.
