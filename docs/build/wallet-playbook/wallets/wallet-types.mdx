description: Learn about the two main types of wallets on Stellar—Classic Wallets and Smart Wallets—and how they differ in structure, capabilities, and implementation.

# Stellar Wallet Types

Stellar supports two primary types of wallets: **Classic Wallets** and **Smart Wallets**. Both types are fully compatible with the Stellar network but differ significantly in state storage, transaction authorization, and their ability to interact with smart contracts.

Your choice between wallet types will depend on your specific use case, desired user experience, and the degree of programmability you require.

## Classic Wallets

**Classic Wallets** utilize Stellar’s traditional [account model](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts), relying entirely on features native to the Stellar protocol. They do not leverage Soroban smart contracts.

### Structure

Classic Wallets:

- Are backed by **Classic Stellar Accounts** (addresses beginning with G...)
- Employ **Ed25519 public/private keypairs** for [transaction signing](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/transactions/signatures-multisig)
- Store account data ([called subentries](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts#subentries)) directly within **Stellar Core**

### Key Features

Classic wallets natively support:

- Sending and receiving XLM and other issued assets
- [Trustline management](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts#trustlines)
- Signer management (adding/removing signers)
- Trading via the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
- Account or trustline sponsorship
- Data storage using the `ManageData` operation

### Ideal Use Cases

Classic wallets are suitable for:

- Lightweight mobile and web wallets
- High-throughput, low-fee transactional applications
- Applications without complex on-chain logic requirements

## [Smart Wallets](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/apps/smart-wallets):

**Smart Wallets** leverage Stellar smart contracts, using programmable contract logic for transaction authorization and state management. This allows for fully customizable on-chain functionality.

### Structure

Smart Wallets:

- Are backed by **Stellar Contract Accounts**
- Utilize contract logic for authorization rather than individual keys
- Can be created and initialized via external apps or directly by users

### Key Features

Smart wallets offer advanced functionality, including:

- Customizable wallet behavior (social recovery, fee-splitting, delegation)
- Programmable transaction authorization with Soroban’s `require_auth`
- Interaction capabilities with other smart contracts (e.g., AMMs, bridges, payment distribution contracts)
- Support for alternative key schemes (e.g., secp256r1, passkeys)

### Ideal Use Cases

Smart wallets are ideal for:

- Wallets requiring advanced access controls (e.g., social recovery, custom permissions)
- Wallets integrated directly with DeFi and on-chain financial applications
- Delegated signing mechanisms using external identity providers
- Applications needing robust on-chain business logic

## Classic vs Smart Wallet Comparison

| Feature        | Classic Wallet            | Smart Wallet                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Backed By      | Stellar Core Account      | Stellar Contract Account       |
| Authorization  | Keypair & multi-signature | Programmable via Soroban logic |
| On-Chain Logic | No                        | Yes                            |

## Choosing the Right Wallet Type

| Use Case | Recommended Wallet Type |
| --- | --- |
| Simple wallet for XLM and asset transfers | Classic Wallet |
| Social recovery and advanced permissions | Smart Wallet |
| Trading via Stellar DEX | Classic Wallet |
| Integration with Soroban smart contracts | Both supported at different levels |
| Low-cost user onboarding with sponsorship | Both supported |
