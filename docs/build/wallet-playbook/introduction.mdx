This playbook is designed to help you navigate key design choices — from choosing between **Classic and Smart Wallets** to deciding the right integrations you need. Whether you’re just starting out or scaling to millions of users, this guide will help you build a wallet that’s **secure, user-friendly**, and ready for the next wave of growth.
