# Passkeys

Passkeys are a passwordless authentication standard that uses cryptography to provide a more convenient way to sign in to websites and apps.

With passkeys, users can authenticate using their biometric data, PIN or pattern, removing the need of memorizing and typing passwords. In crypto, passkeys also remove the need of storing private keys or writing down the mnemonic phrase, a common friction point and security risk.

Users can now use passkeys to sign transactions, without the hassle of managing private keys.
