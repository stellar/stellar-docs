## What is x402?

x402 is an open protocol from the Coinbase Developer Platform that enables programmatic, per request payments over HTTP, designed especially for AI agents and APIs. It effectively turns the old “402 Payment Required” HTTP status code into something usable, for both humans and AI agents.

On Stellar, x402 works with Soroban authorization so that clients can pay for API requests via signed auth entries, ideal for micropayments and payment enabled apps. To build an x402-enabled service or integrate payments into your app, see [Build Applications](./README.mdx) and the resources below.

## x402 Compatible Wallets

To support x402 on Stellar, a wallet must support [auth-entry signing](../guides/transactions/signing-soroban-invocations.mdx#method-2-auth-entry-signing) (Soroban authorization entry signing). The following wallets support auth-entry signing:

- Freighter Browser Extension
- Albedo
- Hana
- HOT
- Klever
- OneKey

:::note

Freighter Mobile does not currently support x402; use the Freighter browser extension. Mobile support is planned for a future release.

## x402 Facilitator

The [OpenZeppelin Relayer x402 Plugin for x402](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/relayer-plugin-x402-facilitator) implements the x402 facilitator API so you can serve x402 payments directly from a Relayer instance. It works with the Coinbase x402 ecosystem (e.g., @x402/express) and exposes the expected `/verify`, `/settle`, and `/supported` endpoints under the Relayer plugin router.

### Facilitator Service

The x402 Facilitator Service is now live. Under the hood, the plugin leverages OpenZeppelin Channels to submit transactions onchain via a managed Relayer and Facilitator setup.

#### Testnet Facilitator

To use the deployed x402 plugin on testnet, you will need:

- An API Key (Relayer Service). Generate your testnet API key here: https://channels.openzeppelin.com/testnet/gen
- Facilitator URL. Use the following facilitator endpoint in your configuration: `https://channels.openzeppelin.com/x402/testnet`

#### Mainnet Facilitator

Coming soon.

:::note

This version supports x402 v2 specification. For x402 v1 support, please use a previous version of this plugin (check git history for v1 compatible releases).
