Passkeys are an amazing way to help dapp developers (like yourself) connect users with their projects, protocols, applications, etc. Learn more on the [smart wallets page](../smart-wallets.mdx).

We have been hard at work pioneering some tools to increase the adoption and ease-of-use for passkeys on Stellar. For this tutorial we'll be using the **incredible** [`passkey-kit` package](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit), which takes SO MUCH of the headache and hassle out of the equation.

Before we get into the nitty gritty on passkeys, we have some chores to do. First, we'll set up Launchtube, a service that will help get our transactions on-chain without worrying about gas fees, sequence numbers, or source accounts. Really useful. Then, we'll create a Mercury indexing program, which will be used to keep track of the public key half of a user-generated passkey and then do a reverse lookup to see which smart wallet address the passkey has been added to.

## Launchtube

Let's start with [Launchtube](https://launchtube.xyz). As we mentioned earlier, Launchtube is similar to a "paymaster" service, if you're familiar with account abstraction in EVM networks. We won't actually need to interact with Launchtube _directly_. All that will be handled by the `passkey-kit` package. However, we'll need to get a JWT token that will allow us to authenticate our dapp with Launchtube.

For Testnet Launchtube tokens, we can generate one any time we like. All you have to do is visit `https://testnet.launchtube.xyz/gen` to receive a JWT token that will be valid for three months, and will have 100 XLM in credits (these credits will be consumed when you submit network transactions through Launchtube). Go ahead, [give it a try](https://testnet.launchtube.xyz/gen)!

:::tip

We do have Mainnet Launchtube tokens available! You can request a token in the [`#launchtube` channel](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1293204627361108141) on our [Stellar Developer Discord server](https://discord.gg/stellardev). In particular, pinging `@kalepail`, `@ElliotFriend`, `@carsten.xlm`, or `@Chris.anatalio.xlm` should get you on your way pretty quickly.

:::

Once you have your Launchtube token, copy/paste it into the `.env` file, as the `PRIVATE_LAUNCHTUBE_JWT` variable:

```shell
PRIVATE_LAUNCHTUBE_JWT=<insert_your_launchtube_jwt_here>
```

:::info

The `PRIVATE_` and `PUBLIC_` environment variables are a SvelteKit convention, allowing us to access these variables in appropriate places throughout our codebase using the [`$env/static/private`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$env-static-private) and [`$env/static/public`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$env-static-public) modules, respectively.

## Mercury

Now, on to [Mercury](https://www.mercurydata.app/). This is a data indexer, running on both Testnet and Mainnet. The team is developing some bleeding-edge data tools that are beginning to redefine what's possible with network data. One such development is the [ZephyrVM](https://docs.mercurydata.app/zephyr-full-customization/introduction): Mercury's cloud execution environment. In short, Zephyr allows you to write (Rust) programs that will run at the close of _every_ ledger on the Stellar network. Inside that program, you can access any kind of current or past data, interact with external web services, create serverless functions, and populate databases. Similar to Launchtube, we won't be _directly_ interacting with Mercury inside the Ye Olde Guestbook dapp. Those interactions will be handled by the `passkey-kit` package. Also similar to Launchtube, this one takes some setting up.

The `passkey-kit` package doesn't "ship" with a Zephyr program in the published package, but it _does_ have all the Zephyr goodness you'll need in the source repository. Here's how you get that Zephyr program running on Mercury so you can access the indexed smart wallet events. By the way, these commands are probably best run _outside_ the directory where you're building your guestbook dapp.

1. Clone the `passkey-kit` repository from GitHub and enter the `zephyr` directory within it:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit
   cd passkey-kit/zephyr
   ```

2. Get an authentication token from the Mercury website. You can login to the [Testnet dashboard](https://test.mercurydata.app/) here. Click on the **Get access token** button under the "Active subscriptions" section. You'll be given a JWT which will be valid for the next seven days.

   ![Mercury Data JWT Token](/img/tutorial/guestbook/mercury_token.png)

   Copy/paste this token into the `.env` file:

   ```shell
   PRIVATE_MERCURY_JWT=<insert_your_mercury_jwt_here>
   ```

3. (Optionally) You can get a [long-lasting authentication token](https://docs.mercurydata.app/get-started-with-mercury/authentication) for your account using this token, and making a request to Mercury's API:

   ```shell
   curl -X POST https://api.mercurydata.app/v2/key \
       -H "authorization: Bearer <insert_your_mercury_jwt_here>
   ```

   This will give you an API key that can also be added to your `.env` file. The benefit of this API key is that it will not expire until you generate another API key.

   :::info

   For this tutorial, you'll only need one of these. You can specify the JWT **or** the API key, and get things working exactly the same. In the `PasskeyServer`, though, make sure you specify the corresponding value.

   :::

4. Compile and deploy the event indexer Zephyr program to the Testnet network.

   ```shell
   cargo install mercury-cli
   export MERCURY_JWT="<insert_your_mercury_jwt_here>"
   # Make sure you're using Rust version 1.79.0 or newer
   mercury-cli --jwt $MERCURY_JWT --local false --mainnet false deploy
   ```

If everything succeeds, you're ready to go! Well done!

You're now ready to dive into the actual passkey implementation and get your users authenticated with the guestbook dapp! Let's get to it!

## Troubleshooting

It's possible something has gone wrong during your execution of the processes above. Here are some general suggestions of fixes or things you can try if something goes wrong with your use of Launchtube or Mercury:

1. **Generate a new Launchtube token.** It's possible the Launchtube token you're using has run out of credits. Since we're using Testnet for this tutorial, there's no harm in generating a brand new token any time by visiting `https://testnet.launchtube.xyz/gen` in your browser.
2. **Make sure your Zephyr program successfully deployed.** I've been stuck more than once with a not-working Mercury request because the Zephyr program hadn't actually deployed successfully. Make sure the `mercury-cli deploy` command's output doesn't have any errors in it.
3. **Check the [Mercury documentation](https://docs.mercurydata.app/).** It's quite good and can help you get past a lot of the hurdles you might face.

In any case, feel free to ask questions or drop a chat in the [`#passkeys`](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1250851135561142423) and [`#launchtube`](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1293204627361108141) channels in the Stellar Developer Discord server. There's usually somebody around who's ready and willing to help out!
