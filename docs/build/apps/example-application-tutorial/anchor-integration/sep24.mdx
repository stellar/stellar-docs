SEP-24 provides a standard way for wallets and anchors to interact by having the user open a webview hosted by an anchor to collect and handle KYC information. In this integration, a user's KYC information is gathered and handled entirely by the anchor. For the most part, after the anchor's webview has opened, BasicPay will have little knowledge about what's going on.

:::info

Remember, SEP-24 depends on [SEP-10 authentication](./sep10.mdx). Everything below assumes the user has successfully authenticated with the anchor server, and BasicPay has access to an unexpired authentication token to send with its requests.

## Find the anchor's `TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024`

Before we can ask anything about _how_ to make a SEP-24 transfer, we have to figure out _where_ to discover that information. Fortunately, the SEP-1 protocol describes standardized fields to find out what we need.

```js title=/src/lib/stellar/sep1.js
// Fetches and returns the endpoint used for SEP-24 transfer interactions.
export async function getTransferServerSep24(domain) {
  let { TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024 } = await fetchStellarToml(domain);
  return TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024;
}
```

**Source:** [`github.com/stellar/basic-payment-app/src/lib/stellar/sep1`](https://github.com/stellar/basic-payment-app/blob/main/src/lib/stellar/sep1.js)

## Get `/info`

Our application will request the `/info` endpoint from the anchor's transfer server to understand the supported transfer methods (deposit, withdraw) and available endpoints, as well as additional features that may be available during transfers.

<img src="/assets/basic-pay/sep24-transfers.png" width="70%" alt="Transfers" />

```js title=/src/lib/stellar/sep24.js
// Fetches and returns basic information about what the SEP-24 transfer server supports.
export async function getSep24Info(domain) {
  let transferServerSep24 = await getTransferServerSep24(domain);

  let res = await fetch(`${transferServerSep24}/info`);
  let json = await res.json();

  if (!res.ok) {
    throw error(res.status, {
      message: json.error,
    });
  } else {
    return json;
  }
}
```

## The user clicks "deposit" or "withdraw"

Now that we have all the SEP-24 information the anchor has made available to us, it's up to the user to actually begin the initiation process. In BasicPay, they do that by simply clicking a button that will then trigger the `launchTransferWindowSep24` function.

:::note

This file was pretty heavily covered in the [SEP-6 section](./sep6.mdx). We'll be presenting here the additions we make to this file, though we won't repeat things we've already covered. Remember to check the source files for the full picture.

:::

```html title=/src/routes/dashboard/transfers/+page.svelte
<script>
  /* This <script> tag has been abbreviated for simplicity */

  // Launch the interactive SEP-24 popup window for the user to interact directly with the anchor to begin a transfer.
  const launchTransferWindowSep24 = async ({
    homeDomain,
    assetCode,
    assetIssuer,
    endpoint,
  }) => {
    // We initiate the transfer from the SEP-24 server, and get the
    // interactive URL back from it
    let { url } = await initiateTransfer24({
      authToken: $webAuthStore[homeDomain],
      endpoint: endpoint,
      homeDomain: homeDomain,
      urlFields: {
        asset_code: assetCode,
        account: data.publicKey,
      },
    });

## Retrieve the interactive URL

BasicPay then initiates a transfer method by sending a `POST` request to either the “SEP-24 Deposit” or “SEP-24 Withdraw” endpoint. The anchor then sends an interactive URL that BasicPay will open as a popup for the user to complete and confirm the transfer.

```js title=/src/lib/stellar/sep24.js
// Initiates a transfer using the SEP-24 protocol.
export async function initiateTransfer24({
  authToken,
  endpoint,
  homeDomain,
  urlFields = {},
}) {
  let transferServerSep24 = await getTransferServerSep24(homeDomain);

  let res = await fetch(
    `${transferServerSep24}/transactions/${endpoint}/interactive`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      mode: "cors",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(urlFields),
    },
  );
  let json = await res.json();

  if (!res.ok) {
    throw error(res.status, {
      message: json.error,
    });
  } else {
    return json;
  }
}
```

## Launch the popup window and listen for a callback

BasicPay doesn't really need (or want) to know everything that's happening between the user and the anchor during a SEP-24 transfer. However, we _do_ want to know when the interaction is over, since we may need to take some action at that point. So, we add a callback to the interactive URL and open the popup window.

:::caution

Since BasicPay is an entirely client-side application, we can't provide a callback as a URL. So, we are using a `postMessage` callback. For more information on the details of these callback options, check out [this section of the SEP-24 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#adding-parameters-to-the-url).

```html title=/src/routes/dashboard/transfers/+page.svelte
<script>
  /* This <script> tag has been abbreviated for simplicity */

  // Launch the interactive SEP-24 popup window for the user to interact directly with the anchor to begin a transfer.
  const launchTransferWindowSep24 = async ({
    homeDomain,
    assetCode,
    assetIssuer,
    endpoint,
  }) => {
    /* ... */

    // We add our callback method to the end of the URL and launch the popup
    // window for the user to interact with
    let interactiveUrl = `${url}&callback=postMessage`;
    let popup = window.open(interactiveUrl, "bpaTransfer24Window", "popup");

    // We listen for the callback `message` from the popup window
    window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
      /* ... */
    });
  };
</script>

## Complete transfer

Once the user is finished with the interactive window from the anchor, they'll be brought back to BasicPay. We store the details of the transfer in the `transfersStore` store (remember, this is just so we can track which anchors to query for transfers later on).

```html title=/src/routes/dashboard/transfers/+page.svelte
<script>
  /* This <script> tag has been abbreviated for simplicity */

  // Launch the interactive SEP-24 popup window for the user to interact directly with the anchor to begin a transfer.
  const launchTransferWindowSep24 = async ({
    homeDomain,
    assetCode,
    assetIssuer,
    endpoint,
  }) => {
    /* ... */

    // We listen for the callback `message` from the popup window
    window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
      // Close the interactive window if it's not already
      popup?.close();

      // Store the transfer in the browser's localStorage
      transfers.addTransfer({
        homeDomain: homeDomain,
        protocol: "sep24",
        assetCode: assetCode,
        transferID: event.data.transaction.id,
      });

      /* ... */
    });
  };
</script>

## (Sometimes) Send a Stellar payment

In a withdrawal transaction, BasicPay will also build and present to the user a Stellar transaction for them to sign with their pincode.

```html title=/src/routes/dashboard/transfers/+page.svelte
<script>
  /* This <script> tag has been abbreviated for simplicity */

  // Launch the interactive SEP-24 popup window for the user to interact directly with the anchor to begin a transfer.
  const launchTransferWindowSep24 = async ({
    homeDomain,
    assetCode,
    assetIssuer,
    endpoint,
  }) => {
    /* ... */

    // We listen for the callback `message` from the popup window
    window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
      /* ... */

      // If the user has requested a withdraw with the anchor, they will
      // need to submit a Stellar transaction that sends the asset from
      // the user's account to an account controlled by the anchor.
      if (event.data.transaction.kind === "withdrawal") {
        // Generate a transaction with the necessary details to complete
        // the transfer
        let { transaction, network_passphrase } =
          await createPaymentTransaction({
            source: data.publicKey,
            destination: event.data.transaction.withdraw_anchor_account,
            asset: `${assetCode}:${assetIssuer}`,
            amount: event.data.transaction.amount_in,
            memo: Buffer.from(event.data.transaction.withdraw_memo, "base64"),
          });

        // Set the component variables to hold the transaction details
        paymentXDR = transaction;
        paymentNetwork = network_passphrase;

        // Open the confirmation modal for the user to confirm or reject
        // the Stellar payment transaction. We provide our customized
        // `onPaymentConfirm` function to be called as part of the
        // modal's confirming process.
        open(ConfirmationModal, {
          transactionXDR: paymentXDR,
          transactionNetwork: paymentNetwork,
          onConfirm: onPaymentConfirm,
        });
      }
    });
  };
</script>
