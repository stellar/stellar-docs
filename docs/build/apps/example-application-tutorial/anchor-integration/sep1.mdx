title: "SEP-1: Stellar TOML"
sidebar_position: 20

The [`stellar.toml` file](../../../../tokens/publishing-asset-info.mdx#completing-your-stellartoml) is a common place where the Internet can find information about an organization’s Stellar integration. Regardless of which type of transfer we want to use (SEP-6 or SEP-24), we'll need to start with SEP-1.

For anchors, we’re interested in the `CURRENCIES` they issue, the `TRANSFER_SERVER` and/or `TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024` keywords that indicate if the anchor supports SEP-6, SEP-24, or both, and the `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` which allows a wallet to set up an authenticated user session.

BasicPay is interoperating with the testing anchor located at `testanchor.stellar.org` and you can view its toml file [here](https://testanchor.stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml).

```js title=/src/lib/stellar/sep1.js
import { StellarTomlResolver } from "stellar-sdk";

// Fetches and returns the stellar.toml file hosted by a provided domain.
export async function fetchStellarToml(domain) {
  let stellarToml = await StellarTomlResolver.resolve(domain);
  return stellarToml;
}
```

Strictly speaking, the `StellarTomlResolver` function from the JavaScript SDK is the only function we _need_ to retrieve and use the information provided by the anchor (heck, we could even just write our own `fetch`-based function, and bypass the SDK altogether). However, we've created quite a few "helper" functions to make the rest of our queries a bit more verbose and clear as to what we're looking for from the anchor server. Make sure to check out the `sep1.js` source file linked above!

Using the `stellar.toml` information for an asset with a `home_domain`, we can display to the user some options (depending on the available infrastructure). We'll start with SEP-10 authentication.
