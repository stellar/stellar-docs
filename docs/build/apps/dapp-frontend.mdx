# Develop a Contract with Frontend Templates

This guide picks up where [Build a Dapp Frontend](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/apps/dapp-frontend) left off. From there, we'll:

1. Search GitHub for other Soroban templates
2. Build our own simple template

Building our own template will be a great way to learn how they work. They're not that complicated!

## Search GitHub for other Soroban templates

The official template maintained by Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), as used in [Build a Dapp Frontend](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/apps/dapp-frontend), lives on GitHub at [stellar/soroban-template-astro](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template). It uses the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/). While Astro works with React, Vue, Svelte, and any other UI library, the template opts not to use them, preferring Astro's own templating language, which uses vanilla JavaScript with no UI library.

(You may wonder why it makes this unpopular choice. A fair question! The team wanted to balance actual utility with broad approachability. Not everyone learning Stellar and Soroban is familiar with React, or any other UI library. It also demonstrates that core Soroban libraries all work with any JavaScript project.)

To use other templates, we will clone them from their repositories, and then copy these files into the root of the existing `soroban-hello-world directory`:

```bash

# For example, you could clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples

```

Now copy files into the root of `soroban-hello-world`.

So how can you find other valid frontend templates?

In GitHub, in the main search bar, search for `"soroban-template-"`. With the quotes. Here's a direct link to the search results: [github.com/search?q=%22soroban-template-%22](http://github.com/search?q=%22soroban-template-%22)

You can copy this approach for any other source code website, such as GitLab.

How do you know if any of these are any good? Try them. Look at their source code. How many stars do they have? How active are their maintainers? None of these are perfect metrics, which is why a curated registry might be nice in the future.

If none of them suit, then it might be time to...

## Make your own template

Let’s make our own template! In this example template, we use SolidJS as the JavaScript framework, but other frameworks can be used with minor modifications. The template is using the `hello world` example smart contract, and is a part of the template initialization; bindings for the `hello world` smart contract are created.

This example template is very simple, most of the work goes into creating the `initialize.js` file, which is used to take care of creating a user account, building and deploying the smart contract, and creating the smart contract TypeScript bindings.

### 1. Initialize a SolidJS project

```bash

npx degit solidjs/templates/ts soroban-template-solid
cd soroban-template-solid
npm install
npm run dev

```

The basic SolidJS is now running on localhost port 3000.

#### Dependencies

Most of the needed dependencies are already included by the SolidJS template, we just need to add three more:

```bash

npm install dotenv glob util

```

The `dotenv` package is needed for reading the environment variables, `glob` is used to find files in the project based on a pattern, and `util` contains a function that can be used to execute system commands asynchronously.

#### Smart contract

Since we are going to interact with the smart contract from the `initialize.js` script, let’s copy the smart contract code to the root of the SolidJS template directory. Since the `initialize.js` script is calling Stellar CLI commands, it will only work if the smart contract code is in the same directory as the script.

The root directory should look like this:

```text

├── contracts
│   └── hello_world
│        ├── src
│        │       └── lib.rs
│        └── Cargo.toml
│        └── Makefile
├── node_modules
├── packages
├── src
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── .env
├── index.html
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── initialize.js
├── package.json
└── Cargo.toml

```

### 2. Environment variables

The SolidJS code itself doesn’t need environment variables for this simple example, but since we are going to add smart contract bindings, it makes sense to store information about the network and the user in an .env file instead of hard coding those values.

These are the variables needed:

```bash

STELLAR_NETWORK="testnet"
STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
STELLAR_RPC_URL="https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org"
STELLAR_ACCOUNT="my-user-name"

```

The variables used here are for deploying the contract to testnet and creating the contract bindings for testnet. The user name can be any name, but let’s say you use alice, and have previously created the user `alice` with the Stellar CLI, creating a new account named `alice` will fail.

### 3. Initialize.js

The goal is to have a script that will handle everything smart contract-related, from creating a user account to deploying the smart contract and providing a TypeScript binding for easy smart contract calls from frontend code. The file `initialize.js` contains that script, and the functionality of it will be broken down in the following sections.

#### Definitions

Before diving into the functions in the `initialize.js` script, a few constants and variables are defined. The most noteworthy here is `execAsync()`, which will let us execute CLI commands and wait for the command responses.

```javascript
// Get directory names
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// Define array to hold deployed smart contract info
var smartContracts = Array();

// Run exec commands asynchronously
const execAsync = promisify(exec);
```

#### User

Now that we have the environment variables, dependencies and definitions taken care of, we can get into the scripts that handle the smart contract deployment and integration. First step towards the integration is to create a user:

```javascript
// ###################### Create User ########################

function createUser() {
  execSync(
    `stellar keys generate --fund ${process.env.STELLAR_ACCOUNT} | true`,
  );
}
```

The user is created by calling the Stellar CLI command `stellar keys generate`, and funding it with Friendbot. The user’s name is fetched from the environment variables.

You can check the new user’s public key by running this CLI command:

```bash

stellar keys public-key < my-user-name >

```

With the public key, you can look up the account on [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet).

#### Build contracts

We want the script to build the contract, or contracts in case there are more than one, and it’s a 2-step process. First, we clean up the target folder in case there’s a previous build, and then we call the CLI command to build the contract(s).

```javascript
// Remove all previous build files
function removeFiles(pattern) {
  glob(pattern).forEach((entry) => rmSync(entry));
}

function buildAll() {
  removeFiles(`${dirname}/target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`);
  removeFiles(`${dirname}/target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.d`);
  execSync(`stellar contract build`);
  console.log("Build complete");
}
```

The helper function `removeFiles` will delete any `wasm` or `d` files in the target directory.

#### Deploy contracts

Now that the smart contract has been built, we can deploy the smart contract to the network, so we can invoke the smart contract functions from any client, such as our SolidJS template.

There are three functions related to contract deployment. One that uses the Stellar CLI to deploy the wasm to the network (`deploy()`), one that calls the deploy function for each wasm found (`deployAll()`), in case there is more than one smart contract, and finally a helper function that gets the contract name by parsing the wasm file name.

```javascript
// Get smart contract name from filename
function filenameNoExtension(filename) {
  return path.basename(filename, path.extname(filename));
}

async function deploy(wasm) {
  // Deploy a single contract and get the contract id
  const { stdout, stderr } = await execAsync(
    `stellar contract deploy --wasm ${wasm} --ignore-checks --alias ${filenameNoExtension(wasm)} --source ${process.env.STELLAR_ACCOUNT} --network ${process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK} --rpc-url ${process.env.STELLAR_RPC_URL} --network-passphrase "${process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE}"`,
  );

  // Add deployed contract to array with alias, wasm path and contract id
  smartContracts.push({
    alias: filenameNoExtension(wasm),
    wasm: wasm,
    contractid: stdout.trimEnd(),
  });

  console.log(`Deployed ${filenameNoExtension(wasm)}`);
}

async function deployAll() {
  console.log("Deploying all contracts");
  const wasmFiles = glob(`${dirname}/target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`);

  for (const wasm of wasmFiles) {
    await deploy(wasm);
  }
}
```

The `deploy()` function will get the contract ID from the CLI call, and add the contract name, wasm file path, and contract ID to the `smartContracts[]` array.

In this example, we only use one smart contract, but it’s not uncommon to use multiple smart contracts in a dapp, so the template supports the use of multiple contracts.

##### Create bindings

The Stellar CLI has a convenient command to create an NPM package that makes it easy to call smart contract functions from a JavaScript/TypeScript-based frontend. We call the package “bindings” because that’s what it does: it binds the contract and the frontend together.

As with the contract build functions, the binding function is also capable of handling multiple contracts, so there’s a function for creating the binding package for a contract (`bind()`) and a function that calls `bind()` for each contract (`bindAll()`).

```javascript
function bind({ alias, wasm, contractid }) {
  // Create bindings for a deployed contract
  execSync(
    `stellar contract bindings typescript --contract-id ${contractid} --output-dir ${dirname}/packages/${alias} --overwrite`,
  );
  // Build the package
  execSync(`(cd ${dirname}/packages/${alias} && npm i && npm run build)`);
}

async function bindAll() {
  // Bind all deployed contracts
  for (const contract of smartContracts) {
    await bind(contract);
  }
}
```

The `bindAll()` function iterates the `smartContracts[]` array. The reason for not just using the array of wasms, like in the `deployAll()` function, is that we need the contract ID to generate the bindings.

#### Import bindings

The last step is to configure the smart contract bindings client. The `importContract()` function creates a TypeScript file with a script that configures a client based on the smart contract ID, the network passphrase, and the RPC URL. The client makes it easy to make calls in the frontend code to the smart contract functions.

The file is stored with the contract name as the file name, and with the `.ts` as the extension, e.g., `hello_world.ts`.

```javascript
function importContract({ alias, wasm, contractid }) {
  const outputDir = `${dirname}/src/contracts/`;

  mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });

  const importContent =
    `import * as Client from '${alias}';\n` +
    `export default new Client.Client({\n` +
    `  contractId: "${contractid}",\n` +
    `  networkPassphrase: "${process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE}",\n` +
    `  rpcUrl: "${process.env.STELLAR_RPC_URL}",\n` +
    `${
      process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK === "local" || "standalone"
        ? `  allowHttp: true,\n`
        : null
    }` +
    `});\n`;

  const outputPath = `${outputDir}/${alias}.ts`;
  writeFileSync(outputPath, importContent);

  console.log(`Created import for ${alias}`);
}

function importAll() {
  smartContracts.forEach(importContract);
}
```

#### Main function

At last, we have the main function, which calls the above functions in the right order. Note the asynchronous calls of `deployAll()` and `bindAll()`. The functions following them depend on the completion of the previous functions.

```javascript
// Calling the functions in sequence
async function main() {
  createUser();
  buildAll();
  await deployAll();
  await bindAll();
  importAll();
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error("Initialization failed", e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

#### Complete initialize.js file

This is the complete file. Place it in the SolidJS root:

```javascript
import "dotenv/config";
import { mkdirSync, writeFileSync, rmSync, readFileSync } from "fs";
import { execSync, exec } from "child_process";
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
import { sync as glob } from "glob";
import { promisify } from "util";

// ###################### Definitions ########################

// Get directory names
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// Define array to hold deployed smart contracts
var smartContracts = Array();

// Run exec commands asynchronously
const execAsync = promisify(exec);

// ###################### Create User ########################

function createUser() {
  execSync(
    `stellar keys generate --fund ${process.env.STELLAR_ACCOUNT} | true`,
  );
}

// ###################### Build Contracts ########################

// Remove all previous build files
function removeFiles(pattern) {
  glob(pattern).forEach((entry) => rmSync(entry));
}

function buildAll() {
  removeFiles(`${dirname}/target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`);
  removeFiles(`${dirname}/target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.d`);
  execSync(`stellar contract build`);
  console.log("Build complete");
}

// ###################### Deploy Contracts ########################

// Get smart contract name from filename
function filenameNoExtension(filename) {
  return path.basename(filename, path.extname(filename));
}

async function deploy(wasm) {
  // Deploy a single contract and get the contract id
  const { stdout, stderr } = await execAsync(
    `stellar contract deploy --wasm ${wasm} --ignore-checks --alias ${filenameNoExtension(wasm)} --source ${process.env.STELLAR_ACCOUNT} --network ${process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK} --rpc-url ${process.env.STELLAR_RPC_URL} --network-passphrase "${process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE}"`,
  );

  // Add deployed contract to array with alias, wasm path and contract id
  smartContracts.push({
    alias: filenameNoExtension(wasm),
    wasm: wasm,
    contractid: stdout.substring(0, stdout.length - 1),
  });

  console.log(`Deployed ${filenameNoExtension(wasm)}`);
}

async function deployAll() {
  console.log("Deploying all contracts");
  const wasmFiles = glob(`${dirname}/target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`);

  for (const wasm of wasmFiles) {
    await deploy(wasm);
  }
}

// ###################### Create Bindings ########################

function bind({ alias, wasm, contractid }) {
  // Create bindings for a deployed contract
  execSync(
    `stellar contract bindings typescript --contract-id ${contractid} --output-dir ${dirname}/packages/${alias} --overwrite`,
  );
  // Build the package
  execSync(`(cd ${dirname}/packages/${alias} && npm i && npm run build)`);
}

async function bindAll() {
  // Bind all deployed contracts
  for (const contract of smartContracts) {
    await bind(contract);
  }
}

// ###################### Import Bindings ########################

function importContract({ alias, wasm, contractid }) {
  const outputDir = `${dirname}/src/contracts/`;

  mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });

  const importContent =
    `import * as Client from '${alias}';\n` +
    `export default new Client.Client({\n` +
    `  contractId: "${contractid}",\n` +
    `  networkPassphrase: "${process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE}",\n` +
    `  rpcUrl: "${process.env.STELLAR_RPC_URL}",\n` +
    `${
      process.env.STELLAR_NETWORK === "local" || "standalone"
        ? `  allowHttp: true,\n`
        : null
    }` +
    `});\n`;

  const outputPath = `${outputDir}/${alias}.ts`;
  writeFileSync(outputPath, importContent);

  console.log(`Created import for ${alias}`);
}

function importAll() {
  smartContracts.forEach(importContract);
}

// ###################### Main ########################

// Calling the functions in sequence
async function main() {
  createUser();
  buildAll();
  await deployAll();
  await bindAll();
  importAll();
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error("Initialization failed", e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### 4. Modify Vite config

SolidJS is using the build tool Vite, and we need to make a minor addition to the Vite configuration file (`vite.config.ts`) for the module exports to work. Add these lines to the config:

```javascript

optimizeDeps: {
   include: ['@stellar/stellar-sdk', 'hello_world'],
 },

```

### 5. Build the frontend

The template is now ready to use the smart contract and its binding through the client. Let’s build a very simple dapp, a frontend for the Hello World smart contract, with a text input field and a send button. When a user enters a text string in the input field and clicks the send button, the contract function is invoked with the text string as the argument. The returned value, a string array, is displayed in the frontend.

Here’s an example of how the code could look the existing code in the `src/App.tsx` file with this code:

```javascript

import type { Component } from 'solid-js';
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
import helloWorld from './contracts/hello_world';

const App: Component = () => {
 const [input, setInput] = createSignal('');
 const [greeting, setGreeting] = createSignal('');
 const [loading, setLoading] = createSignal(false);
 const [error, setError] = createSignal<string | null>(null);

 async function getGreeting(e?: Event) {
   e?.preventDefault();
   setError(null);
   setLoading(true);
   try {
     const { result } = await helloWorld.hello({ to: input() || 'you' });
     const greet = Array.isArray(result) ? result.join(' ') : String(result);
     setGreeting(greet);
   } catch (err: any) {
     console.error(err);
     setError(err?.message || 'Unknown error');
   } finally {
     setLoading(false);
   }
 }

 return (
   <div>
     <h1>Hello Soroban Solid Template!</h1>

     <form onSubmit={getGreeting}>
       <input
         type="text"
         placeholder="Type your name..."
         value={input()}
         onInput={(e: any) => setInput(e.target.value)}
       />
       <button type="submit" disabled={loading()}>{loading() ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'}</button>
     </form>

     {error() && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>Error: {error()}</p>}

     <p>{greeting()}</p>
   </div>
 );
};

export default App;

```

### 6. Try it out

We can now run the code with this command:

```bash

npm run dev

```

The URL for the dapp will be shown in the terminal, typically it’s http://localhost:3000 unless the port 3000 is already in use.
