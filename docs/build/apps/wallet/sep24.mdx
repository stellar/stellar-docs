The [SEP-24] standard defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users. Wallets use this standard to facilitate exchanges between on-chain assets (such as stablecoins) and off-chain assets (such as fiat, or other network assets such as BTC).

During the flow, a wallet makes several requests to the anchor, and finally receives an interactive URL to open in iframe. This URL is used by the user to provide an input (such as KYC) directly to the anchor. Finally, the wallet can fetch transaction information using query endpoints.

## Get Anchor Information

Let's start with getting an instance of `Sep24` class, responsible for all SEP-24 interactions:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kotlin
val sep24 = anchor.sep24()
```

```typescript
const sep24 = await anchor.sep24();
```

```dart
final sep24 = await anchor.sep24();
```

```swift
let sep24 = anchor.sep24
```

</WalletCodeExample>

First, let's get the information about the anchor's support for [SEP-24]. This request doesn't require authentication, and will return generic info, such as supported currencies, and features supported by the anchor. You can get a full list of returned fields in the [SEP-24 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#info).

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
suspend fun getAnchorServices(): AnchorServiceInfo {
  return sep24.getServicesInfo()
}
```

```typescript
const getAnchorServices = async (): Promise<AnchorServiceInfo> => {
  return await anchor.getServicesInfo();
};
```

```dart
final servicesInfo = await sep24.getServiceInfo();
```

```swift
let servicesInfo = try await sep24.info
```

</WalletCodeExample>

## Interactive Flows

Before getting started, make sure you have connected to the anchor and received an authentication token, as described in the [Stellar Authentication] wallet guide. We will use the `authToken` object in the examples below as the [SEP-10] authentication token, obtained earlier.

To initiate an operation, we need to know an asset. You may want to hard-code it, or get it dynamically from the anchor's info file, like shown below (for USDC):

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val asset = info.currencies.first { it.code == "USDC" }.assetId
```

```typescript
import { IssuedAssetId } from "@stellar/typescript-wallet-sdk";

const assetCode = "USDC";

const info = await anchor.getInfo();

const currency = info.currencies.find(({ code }) => code === assetCode);

if (!currency?.code || !currency?.issuer) {
  throw new Error(
    `Anchor does not support ${assetCode} asset or is not correctly configured on TOML file`,
  );
}

const asset = new IssuedAssetId(currency.code, currency.issuer);
```

```dart
final asset = info.currencies.firstWhere((it)=>it.code=='USDC').assetId;
```

```swift
let info = try await anchor.info
let asset = try info.currencies?.first(where: {$0.code == "USDC"})?.assetId
```

</WalletCodeExample>

:::info

Before starting with the deposit flow, make sure that the user account has [established a trustline](./stellar.mdx#modify-assets-trustlines) for the asset you are working with.

:::

### Basic Flow

Let's start with a basic deposit:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, authToken)
```

```typescript
const deposit = await sep24.deposit({
  assetCode: asset.code,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
final deposit = await sep24.deposit(asset, authToken);
```

```swift
let deposit = try await sep24.deposit(assetId: asset, authToken: authToken)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

As a result, you will get an [interactive response](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) from the anchor.

Open the received URL in an iframe and save the transaction ID for future reference:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val url = deposit.url
val id = deposit.id
```

```typescript
const url = deposit.url;
const id = deposit.id;
```

```dart
final url = deposit.url;
final id = deposit.id;
```

```swift
let url = deposit.url
let id = deposit.id
```

</WalletCodeExample>

Similarly to the deposit flow, a basic withdrawal flow has the same method signature and response type:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken)
val url = withdrawal.url
val id = withdrawal.id
```

```typescript
const withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw({
  assetCode: asset.code,
  authToken,
});
const url = withdrawal.url;
const id = withdrawal.id;
```

```dart
final withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken);
final url = withdrawal.url;
final id = withdrawal.id;
```

```swift
let withdrawal = try await sep24.withdraw(assetId: asset, authToken: authToken)
let url = withdrawal.url
let id = withdrawal.id
```

</WalletCodeExample>

### Providing KYC Info

To improve the user experience, the [SEP-24] standard supports passing user KYC to the anchor via [SEP-9]. In turn, the anchor will pre-fill this information in the interactive popup.

:::info

While [SEP-9] supports passing binary data, the current version of the SDK doesn't offer such functionality.

:::

:::note

At the time, accepted [SEP-9] is not strictly typed yet. Improved typing will be offered in future versions.

:::

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val sep9 = mapOf("email_address" to "mail@example.com")

val deposit = sep24.deposit(asset, authToken, sep9)
```

```typescript
const deposit = await sep24.deposit({
  assetCode: asset.code,
  authToken,
  extraFields: { email_address: "mail@example.com" },
});
```

```dart
final deposit = await sep24.deposit(asset, authToken,
  extraFields: {"email_address": "mail@example.com"});
```

```swift
let deposit = try await sep24.deposit(assetId: asset,
                                      authToken: authToken,
                                      extraFields: ["email_address" : "mail@example.com"])
```

</WalletCodeExample>

### Changing Stellar Transfer Account

By default, the Stellar transfer will be sent to the authenticated account (with a memo) that initiated the deposit.

While in most cases it's acceptable, some wallets may split their accounts. To do so, pass additional account (and optionally a memo):

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
suspend fun depositDifferentAccount(): InteractiveFlowResponse {
  val recipientAccount = "G..."
  val memo = "my memo" to MemoType.TEXT
  return sep24.deposit(asset, authToken, destinationAccount = recipientAccount, destinationMemo = memo)
}
```

```typescript
import { Memo, MemoText } from "stellar-sdk";

const recipientAccount = "G...";
const depositDifferentAccount = async (): Promise<InteractiveFlowResponse> => {
  return await sep24.deposit({
    destinationAccount: recipientAccount,
    destinationMemo: new Memo(MemoText, "some memo"),
    assetCode: asset.code,
    authToken,
  });
};
```

```dart
final recipientAccount = "G...";
final deposit = await sep24.deposit(asset, authToken, destinationAccount: recipientAccount,
  destinationMemo: "my memo", destinationMemoType: MemoType.text);
```

```swift
let recipientAccount = "G..."
let deposit = try await sep24.deposit(assetId: asset,
                                      authToken: authToken,
                                      destinationAccount: recipientAccount,
                                      destinationMemo: "my memo",
                                      destinationMemoType: MemoType.text)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

Similarly, for a withdrawal, the origin account of the Stellar transaction could be changed:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val originAccount = "G..."
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken, withdrawalAccount = originAccount)
```

```typescript
const originAccount = "G...";
const withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw({
  withdrawalAccount: originAccount,
  assetCode: asset.code,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
final originAccount = "G...";
final withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken, withdrawalAccount: originAccount);
```

```swift
let originAccount = "G..."
let withdrawal = try await sep24.withdraw(assetId: asset,
                                          authToken: authToken,
                                          withdrawalAccount: originAccount)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

## Getting Transaction Info

On the typical flow, the wallet would get transaction data to notify users about status updates. This is done via the [SEP-24] `GET /transaction` and `GET /transactions` endpoint.

Alternatively, some anchors support webhooks for notifications. Note that this feature is not widely adopted yet.

### Tracking Transaction

Let's look into how to use the wallet SDK to track transaction status changes. We will use `Watcher` class for this purpose. First, let's initialize watcher and start tracking a transaction.

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(authToken, "transaction id")
```

```typescript
const watcher = sep24.watcher();

const { stop, refresh } = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode: asset.code,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final watcher = sep24.watcher();
final result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(authToken, "transaction id");
```

```swift
let watcher = sep24.watcher()
let result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(authToken: authToken,
                                         id: "transaction id")
```

</WalletCodeExample>

Alternatively, we can track multiple transactions for the same asset.

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val watcher = sep24.watcher()
val result = watcher.watchAsset(getAuthToken(), asset)
```

```typescript
const watcher = sep24.watcher();

const { stop, refresh } = watcher.watchAllTransactions({
  authToken,
  assetCode: asset.code,
  onMessage,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final watcher = sep24.watcher();
final result = watcher.watchAsset(authToken, asset);
```

```swift
let watcher = sep24.watcher()
let result = watcher.watchAsset(authToken: authToken, asset: asset)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

<LanguageSpecific kt={<KtWatcher />} />

### Fetching Transaction

While `Watcher` class offers powerful tracking capabilities, sometimes it's required to just fetch a transaction (or transactions) once. The `Anchor` class allows you to fetch a transaction by ID, Stellar transaction ID, or external transaction ID:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
// "id" is the actual Anchor transaction id, all transactions should have it.
val transaction = sep24.getTransactionBy(authToken, id = "transaction id")

// "stellarTransactionId" (aka "stellar_transaction_id" on the SEP spec)
// is the hash of the Stellar network transaction payment related to this
// Anchor transaction.
// The "stellarTransactionId" has a SHA256 hash format like the below:
// - "a35135d8ed4b29b66d821444f6760f8ca1e77bea1fb49541bebeb2c3d844364a"
// E.g. we'll only have this transaction id field AFTER the wallet sends funds
// to Anchor on the withdrawal flow or receives funds from Anchor on the
// deposit flow.
val transaction = sep24.getTransactionBy(authToken, stellarTransactionId = "transaction id")

// "externalTransactionId" (aka "external_transaction_id" on the SEP spec)
// could refer to some ID of transaction on external network.
// E.g. this could be some "reference number" displayed to the user on
// the last step of the Interactive Flow UI which the user could use in some
// other external place to complete the deposit or withdraw operation.
val transaction = sep24.getTransactionBy(authToken, externalTransactionId = "transaction id")
```

```typescript
const transaction = await sep24.getTransactionBy({
  authToken,
  id: transactionId,
});

// "id" is the actual Anchor transaction id, all transactions should have it.
const transaction = await anchor.sep24().getTransactionBy({
  authToken,
  id: transactionId,
});

// "stellarTransactionId" (aka "stellar_transaction_id" on the SEP spec)
// is the hash of the Stellar network transaction payment related to this
// Anchor transaction.
// The "stellarTransactionId" has a SHA256 hash format like the below:
// - "a35135d8ed4b29b66d821444f6760f8ca1e77bea1fb49541bebeb2c3d844364a"
// E.g. we'll only have this transaction id field AFTER the wallet sends funds
// to Anchor on the withdrawal flow or receives funds from Anchor on the
// deposit flow.
const transaction = await anchor.sep24().getTransactionBy({
  authToken,
  stellarTransactionId,
});

// "externalTransactionId" (aka "external_transaction_id" on the SEP spec)
// could refer to some ID of transaction on external network.
// E.g. this could be some "reference number" displayed to the user on
// the last step of the Interactive Flow UI which the user could use in some
// other external place to complete the deposit or withdraw operation.
const transaction = await anchor.sep24().getTransactionBy({
  authToken,
  externalTransactionId,
});
```

```dart
final transaction = await sep24.getTransaction("transaction id", authToken);
```

```swift
// "transactionId" is the actual Anchor transaction id, all transactions should have it.
let transaction = try await anchor.sep24.getTransactionBy(authToken: authToken,
                                                          transactionId: "transaction id")

// "stellarTransactionId" (aka "stellar_transaction_id" on the SEP spec)
// is the hash of the Stellar network transaction payment related to this
// Anchor transaction.
// The "stellarTransactionId" has a SHA256 hash format like the below:
// - "a35135d8ed4b29b66d821444f6760f8ca1e77bea1fb49541bebeb2c3d844364a"
// E.g. we'll only have this transaction id field AFTER the wallet sends funds
// to Anchor on the withdrawal flow or receives funds from Anchor on the
// deposit flow.
let transaction = try await anchor.sep24.getTransactionBy(authToken: authToken,
                                                          stellarTransactionId: "stellar transaction id")

// "externalTransactionId" (aka "external_transaction_id" on the SEP spec)
// could refer to some ID of transaction on external network.
// E.g. this could be some "reference number" displayed to the user on
// the last step of the Interactive Flow UI which the user could use in some
// other external place to complete the deposit or withdraw operation.
let transaction = try await anchor.sep24.getTransactionBy(authToken: authToken,
                                                          externalTransactionId: "external transaction id")
```

</WalletCodeExample>

It's also possible to fetch transaction by the asset

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val transactions = sep24.getTransactionsForAsset(asset, authToken)
```

```typescript
const transactions = await sep24.getTransactionsForAsset({
  authToken,
  assetCode: asset.code,
});
```

```dart
final transactions = await sep24.getTransactionsForAsset(asset, authToken);
```

```swift
let transactions = try await sep24.getTransactionsForAsset(authToken: authToken, asset: asset)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

## Submitting Withdrawal Transfer

Previously, we took a look at starting the withdrawal flow. Now, let's take a look at a full example.

First, start the withdrawal:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawal = sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken)
```

```typescript
const withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw({
  assetCode: asset.code,
  authToken,
});
```

```dart
final withdrawal = await sep24.withdraw(asset, authToken);
```

```swift
let withdrawal = try await sep24.withdraw(assetId: asset, authToken: authToken)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

Next, open an interactive url :

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val url = withdrawal.url
// open the url
```

```typescript
const url = withdrawal.url;
// open the url
```

```dart
final url = withdrawal.url
// open the url
```

```swift
let url = withdrawal.url
// open the url
```

</WalletCodeExample>

After that we need to wait until the anchor is ready to receive funds. To do so, we will be waiting until transaction reaches `pending_user_transfer_start` status. This code uses a simple watching (polling) mechanism with no bail-out condition. The application’s code should be more robust.

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val withdrawalWatcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(authToken, withdrawal.id)
var statusChange: StatusUpdateEvent

// Wait for user input
do {
  statusChange = withdrawalWatcher.channel.receive()
} while (
  ((statusChange as? StatusChange) ?: throw Exception("Channel unexpectedly closed"))
    .status != TransactionStatus.PENDING_USER_TRANSFER_START
)
```

```typescript
const watcher = sep24.watcher();

const onMessage = (transaction) => {
  if (transaction.status === "pending_user_transfer_start") {
    // begin transfer code
  }
};

const onSuccess = (transaction) => {
  // transaction comes back as completed / refunded / expired
};

const onError = (transaction) => {
  // runtime error, or the transaction comes back as
  // no_market / too_small / too_large / error
};

// We can watch for a particular transaction.
const { refresh, stop } = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode: asset.code,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});

// Or watch for ALL transactions of a particular asset.
const { refresh, stop } = watcher.watchAllTransactions({
  authToken,
  assetCode: asset.code,
  onMessage,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final withdrawalWatcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(authToken, withdrawal.id);
withdrawalWatcher.controller.stream.listen(
  (event) {
    if (event is StatusChange && TransactionStatus.pendingUserTransferStart == event.status) {
      // begin transfer
    }
  },
  onError: (error) {
    // handle error
  },
);
```

```swift
let watcher = anchor.sep24.watcher()
let result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(authToken: authToken,
                                         id: withdrawal.id)

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,
                                       selector: #selector(handleEvent(_:)),
                                       name: result.notificationName,
                                       object: nil)

/// ...
@objc public func handleEvent(_ notification: Notification) {
    if let statusChange = notification.object as? StatusChange {
        print("Status change to \(statusChange.status.rawValue). Transaction: \(statusChange.transaction.id)")
        if statusChange.status == TransactionStatus.pendingUserTransferStart {
          // begin transfer
        }
    } else if let _ = notification.object as? ExceptionHandlerExit {
        print("Exception handler exited the job")
    } else if let _ = notification.object as? NotificationsClosed {
        print("Notifications closed. Job is done")
    }
}
```

</WalletCodeExample>

Next, sign and submit the Stellar transfer:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
val anchorTransaction = (statusChange.transaction as WithdrawalTransaction)
val transfer = stellar.transaction(keypair).transferWithdrawalTransaction(anchorTransaction, asset).build()

transfer.sign(keypair)

stellar.submitTransaction(transfer)
```

```typescript
// Import Horizon to get the result codes for error handling
import { Horizon } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

// This creates a transaction builder which we'll be using to assemble
// our transfer withdrawal transaction as shown below.
const txBuilder = await stellar.transaction({
  sourceAddress: keypair,
  baseFee: 10000, // this is 0.001 XLM
  timebounds: 180, // in seconds
});

// We can use the transaction object received on the onMessage callback from
// the watcher, or, we can also fetch the transaction object using either
// getTransactionBy or getTransactionsForAsset as illustrated in previous step.
onMessage: (transaction) => {
  if (transaction.status === "pending_user_transfer_start") {
    // Use the builder to assemble the transfer transaction. Behind the scenes
    // it extracts the Stellar account (withdraw_anchor_account), memo (withdraw_memo)
    // and amount (amount_in) to use in the Stellar payment transaction that will
    // be submitted to the Stellar network.
    const transferTransaction = txBuilder
      .transferWithdrawalTransaction(transaction, asset)
      .build();

    // Signs it with the account key pair
    transferTransaction.sign(keypair);

    // Finally submits it to the Stellar network. This stellar.submitTransaction()
    // function handles '504' status codes (timeout) by keep retrying it until
    // submission succeeds or we get a different error.
    try {
      const response = await stellar.submitTransaction(transferTransaction);
      console.log("Stellar-generated transaction ID: ", response.id);
    } catch (error) {
      /*
        In case it's not a 504 (timeout) error, the application could try some

Where `keypair` is the SEP-10 authenticated account. If you want to transfer funds from a different address, refer to [Changing Stellar Transfer Account](#changing-stellar-transfer-account) section.

Code for submitting transactions to Stellar should be developed thoughtfully. The SDF has a documentation page dedicated to [submitting transactions and handling errors gracefully]. Here are a few things you need to keep in mind:

- Offer a high fee. Your fee should be as high as you would offer before deciding the transaction is no longer worth sending. Stellar will only charge you the minimum necessary to be included in the ledger -- you won't be charged the amount you offer unless everyone else is offering the same amount or greater. Otherwise, you’ll pay the smallest fee offered in the set of transactions included in the ledger.
- Set a maximum timebound on the transaction. This ensures that if your transaction is not included in a ledger before the set time, you can reconstruct the transaction with a higher offered fee and submit it again with better chances of inclusion.
- Resubmit the transaction when you get 504 status codes. 504 status codes are just telling you that your transaction is still pending -- not that it has been canceled or that your request was invalid. You should simply make the request again with the same transaction to get a final status (either included or expired).

Finally, let's track transaction status updates. In this example we simply check if the transaction has been completed:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kt
var terminalStatus: TransactionStatus? = null

do {
  statusChange = withdrawalWatcher.channel.receive()

  when (statusChange) {
    is StatusChange -> {
      if (statusChange.status.isTerminal()) {
        terminalStatus = statusChange.status
      }
    }
    is ChannelClosed -> println("Transaction tracking finished")
    is ExceptionHandlerExit ->
      println("Retries exhausted trying obtain transaction data, giving up.")
  }
} while (statusChange !is ChannelClosed)

if (terminalStatus != TransactionStatus.COMPLETED) {
  println("Transaction was not completed")
}
```

```typescript
const watcher = sep24.watcher();

const onSuccess = (transaction) => {
  // transaction came back as completed / refunded / expired
  console.log("Transaction is completed");
};

const onError = (transaction) => {
  // runtime error, or the transaction comes back as
  // no_market / too_small / too_large / error
};

const { refresh, stop } = watcher.watchOneTransaction({
  authToken,
  assetCode: asset.code,
  id: successfulTransaction.id,
  onMessage,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
});
```

```dart
final watcher = sep24.watcher().watchOneTransaction(authToken, withdrawal.id);
watcher.controller.stream.listen(
  (event) {
    if (event is StatusChange && event.status.isTerminal()) {
      if (TransactionStatus.completed != event.status) {
        print("Transaction was not completed!");
      } else {
        print("Success");
      }
    } else if (event is ExceptionHandlerExit) {
      print("Retries exhausted trying obtain transaction data, giving up.");
    } else if (event is StreamControllerClosed) {
      print("Transaction tracking finished");
    }
  },
  onError: (error) {
    // handle error
  },
);
```

```swift
let watcher = anchor.sep24.watcher()
let result = watcher.watchOneTransaction(authToken: authToken,
                                         id: withdrawal.id)

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,
                                       selector: #selector(handleEvent(_:)),
                                       name: result.notificationName,
                                       object: nil)

/// ...
@objc public func handleEvent(_ notification: Notification) {
    if let statusChange = notification.object as? StatusChange {
        if statusChange.status != TransactionStatus.completed {
          print("Transaction was not completed!")
        } else {
          print("Success")
        }
    } else if let _ = notification.object as? ExceptionHandlerExit {
        print("Exception handler exited the job")
    } else if let _ = notification.object as? NotificationsClosed {
        print("Notifications closed. Job is done")
    }
}
```
