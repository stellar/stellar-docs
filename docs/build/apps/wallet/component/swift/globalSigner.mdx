Finally, with the approach above we define the signer and client domain per request. If you want to define it once and use it for every authentication call your application is making, you can do so via changing the configuration:

<CodeExample>

```swift
let appCfg = AppConfig(defaultSigner: try DomainSigner(url: "https://my-domain.com/sign"),
                       defaultClientDomain: "my-domain.com")
```

</CodeExample>

This is particularly useful for integrating with multiple anchors.
