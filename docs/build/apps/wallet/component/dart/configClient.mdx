### Configuring the Client

The Flutter Wallet SDK uses the standard Client from the [http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http) for all network requests (excluding Horizon, where the Flutter Stellar SDK's HTTP client is used).

Optionally, you can set your own client from [http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http) to be used across the app.

The client can be globally configured:

<CodeExample>

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart';
// ...

// init and configure your HTTP client
// var myClient = ...

// set as default HTTP client
var appConfig = ApplicationConfiguration(defaultClient: myClient);
var walletCustomClient = Wallet(StellarConfiguration.testNet, applicationConfiguration: appConfig);
```

</CodeExample>

Some [test cases](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_wallet_flutter_sdk/tree/main/test) of this SDK use for example the `MockClient`.
