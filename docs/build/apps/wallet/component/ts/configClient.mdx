### Configuring the Client

The Typescript wallet SDK uses the [axios client](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for all network requests. You can read more about how to configure the axios client [here](https://axios-http.com/docs/instance).

For example, we can configure our axios client to be globally configured with a timeout:

```typescript
const customClient: AxiosInstance = axios.create({
  timeout: 1000,
});
let appConfig = new ApplicationConfiguration(DefaultSigner, customClient);
let wal = new Wallet({
  stellarConfiguration: StellarConfiguration.TestNet(),
  applicationConfiguration: appConfig,
});
```

You can find more [configure options here.](https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config)
