Finally, with the approach above we define the signer and client domain per request. If you want to define it once and use it for every authentication call your application is making, you can do so via changing the configuration:

```typescript
const appCfg = new ApplicationConfiguration(
  new DomainSigner("https://my-domain.com/sign", { ...headers }),
  undefined,
  "my-domain.com",
);
```

This is particularly useful for integrating with multiple anchors.
