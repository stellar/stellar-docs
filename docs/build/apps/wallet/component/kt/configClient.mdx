### Configuring the Client

The Kotlin wallet SDK uses the [ktor client](https://ktor.io/docs/getting-started-ktor-client.html) for all network requests (excluding Horizon, where the Stellar SDK's HTTP client is used). Currently, the okhttp engine is configured to be used with the client. You can read more about how to configure the ktor client [here](https://ktor.io/docs/create-client.html#configure-client).

For example, the client can be globally configured:

```kotlin
val walletCustomClient =
  Wallet(
    StellarConfiguration.Testnet,
    ApplicationConfiguration(
      defaultClientConfig = {
        engine { this.config { this.connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10)) } }
        install(HttpRequestRetry) {
          retryOnServerErrors(maxRetries = 5)
          exponentialDelay()
        }
      }
    )
  )
```

This Kotlin code will set the connect timeout to ten seconds via the [okhttp configuration](https://ktor.io/docs/http-client-engines.html#okhttp) and also installs the [retry plugin](https://ktor.io/docs/client-retry.html). You can also specify client configuration for specific wallet SDK classes.

For example, to change connect timeout when connecting to some anchor server:

```kotlin
val anchorCustomClient =
  walletCustomClient.anchor("example.com") {
    engine { this.config { this.connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) } }
  }
```

### Closing Resources

After the wallet class is no longer used, it's necessary to close all clients used by it. While in some applications it may not be required (e.g. the wallet lives for the whole lifetime of the application), in other cases it can be required. If your wallet class is short-lived, it's recommended to close client resources using a close function:

```kotlin
fun closeWallet() {
  wallet.close()
}
```
