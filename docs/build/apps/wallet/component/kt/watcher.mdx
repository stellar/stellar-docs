Next, let's get the channel provided by `WatcherResult` to receive events.

```kt
do {
  val event = result.channel.receive()
  when (event) {
    is StatusChange ->
      println("Status changed to ${event.status}. Transaction: ${event.transaction}")
    is ExceptionHandlerExit -> println("Exception handler exited the job")
    is ChannelClosed -> println("Channel closed. Job is done")
  }
} while (event !is ChannelClosed)
```

This code example will consume all events coming from the channel until it's closed. There are three types of events:

- `StatusChange`: indicates that transaction status has changed.
- `ExceptionHandlerExit`: indicates that the exception handler exited the processing loop. With default retry handler it happens when retries are exhausted.
- `ChannelClosed`: indicates that the channel is closed and no more events will be emitted. This event will always fire. If `ExceptionHandlerExit` happened, channel will close right after. Otherwise, (under normal circumstances) it will stop when all transactions reach terminal statuses.

:::info

Events are stored in the channel until they are received, and calling the `receive()` method will block the channel until a message is received. You can read more about how channels work in the [channel documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-and-channels.html#channels).
