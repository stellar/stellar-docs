## Installation

First, you need to add the SDK dependency to your project.

<LanguageSpecific
  kt={<KtInstall />}
  ts={<TsInstall />}
  dart={<DartInstall />}
/>

## Working with the SDK

Let's start with the main class that provides all SDK functionality. It's advised to have a singleton wallet object shared across the application. Creating a wallet with a default configuration connected to Stellar's Testnet is simple:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val wallet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration.Testnet)
```

```ts
let wallet = walletSdk.Wallet.TestNet();
```

```dart
var wallet = Wallet.testNet;
```

</CodeExample>

The wallet instance can be further configured. For example, to connect to the public network:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val walletTestnet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration(Network.TESTNET, "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org"))
```

```typescript
let wallet = new Wallet({
  stellarConfiguration: StellarConfiguration.MainNet(),
});
```

```dart
var wallet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration.publicNet);
```

</CodeExample>

<LanguageSpecific kt={<KtHttpConfig />} />

<LanguageSpecific
  kt={<KtConfigClient />}
  ts={<TsConfigClient />}
  dart={<DartConfigClient />}
/>

## Stellar Basics

The wallet SDK provides some extra functionality on top of the existing [Horizon SDK]. For interaction with the Stellar network, the wallet SDK covers only the basics used in a typical wallet flow. For more advanced use cases, the underlying [Horizon SDK] should be used instead.

To interact with the Horizon instance configured in the previous steps, simply do:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val stellar = wallet.stellar()
```

```typescript
const stellar = wallet.stellar();
```

```dart
var stellar = wallet.stellar();
```

</CodeExample>

This example will create a Stellar class that manages the connection to Horizon service.

:::note

Default configuration connects to the public Stellar Horizon instance. You can change this behavior as described [above](#working-with-the-sdk).

You can read more about working with the Stellar network in the [respective section](./stellar.mdx).

## Anchor Basics

Primary use of the SDK is to provide an easy way to connect to anchors via sets of protocols known as SEPs. Let's look into connecting to the Stellar test anchor:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
val anchor = wallet.anchor("https://testanchor.stellar.org")
```

```typescript
let anchor = wallet.anchor({ homeDomain: "testanchor.stellar.org" });
```

```dart
var anchor = wallet.anchor("testanchor.stellar.org")
```

</CodeExample>

<LanguageSpecific ts={<AllowHttpInfo />} />

And the most basic interaction of fetching a [SEP-1]: Stellar Info File:

<CodeExample>

```kotlin
suspend fun anchorToml(): TomlInfo {
  return anchor.getInfo()
}
```

```typescript
let resp = await anchor.sep1();
```

```dart
var resp = await anchor.sep1();
```

</CodeExample>

The anchor class also supports [SEP-10]: Stellar Authentication and [SEP-24]: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal features.
