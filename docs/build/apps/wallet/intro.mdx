# Getting Started

import { LanguageSpecific } from "@site/src/components/LanguageSpecific";
import { WalletCodeExample } from "@site/src/components/WalletCodeExample";
import Header from "./component/header.mdx";
import KtInstall from "./component/kt/install.mdx";
import TsInstall from "./component/ts/install.mdx";
import DartInstall from "./component/dart/install.mdx";
import SwiftInstall from "./component/swift/install.mdx";
import KtHttpConfig from "./component/kt/httpConfig.mdx";
import KtConfigClient from "./component/kt/configClient.mdx";
import TsConfigClient from "./component/ts/configClient.mdx";
import DartConfigClient from "./component/dart/configClient.mdx";
import AllowHttpInfo from "./component/ts/allowHttpInfo.mdx";

## Installation

First, you need to add the SDK dependency to your project.

<LanguageSpecific
  kt={<KtInstall />}
  ts={<TsInstall />}
  flutter={<DartInstall />}
  swift={<SwiftInstall />}
/>

## Working with the SDK

Let's start with the main class that provides all SDK functionality. It's advised to have a singleton wallet object shared across the application. Creating a wallet with a default configuration connected to Stellar's Testnet is simple:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kotlin
val wallet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration.Testnet)
```

```ts
let wallet = walletSdk.Wallet.TestNet();
```

```dart
var wallet = Wallet.testNet;
```

```swift
let wallet = Wallet.testNet
```

</WalletCodeExample>

The wallet instance can be further configured. For example, to connect to the public network:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kotlin
val walletTestnet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration(Network.TESTNET, "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org"))
```

```typescript
let wallet = new Wallet({
  stellarConfiguration: StellarConfiguration.MainNet(),
});
```

```dart
var wallet = Wallet(StellarConfiguration.publicNet);
```

```swift
let wallet = Wallet(stellarConfig: StellarConfig.publicNet)
```

</WalletCodeExample>

<LanguageSpecific kt={<KtHttpConfig />} />

<LanguageSpecific
  kt={<KtConfigClient />}
  ts={<TsConfigClient />}
  flutter={<DartConfigClient />}
/>

## Stellar Basics

The wallet SDK provides some extra functionality on top of the existing [Horizon SDK](/docs/tools/sdks/README.mdx). For interaction with the Stellar network, the wallet SDK covers only the basics used in a typical wallet flow. For more advanced use cases, the underlying [Horizon SDK](/docs/tools/sdks/README.mdx) should be used instead.

To interact with the Horizon instance configured in the previous steps, simply do:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kotlin
val stellar = wallet.stellar()
```

```typescript
const stellar = wallet.stellar();
```

```dart
var stellar = wallet.stellar();
```

```swift
let stellar = wallet.stellar
```

</WalletCodeExample>

This example will create a Stellar class that manages the connection to Horizon service.

:::note

Default configuration connects to the public Stellar Horizon instance. You can change this behavior as described [above](#working-with-the-sdk).

:::

You can read more about working with the Stellar network in the [respective section](./stellar.mdx).

## Anchor Basics

Primary use of the SDK is to provide an easy way to connect to anchors via sets of protocols known as SEPs. Let's look into connecting to the Stellar test anchor:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kotlin
val anchor = wallet.anchor("https://testanchor.stellar.org")
```

```typescript
let anchor = wallet.anchor({ homeDomain: "testanchor.stellar.org" });
```

```dart
var anchor = wallet.anchor("testanchor.stellar.org")
```

```swift
let anchor = wallet.anchor(homeDomain: "testanchor.stellar.org")
```

</WalletCodeExample>

<LanguageSpecific ts={<AllowHttpInfo />} />

And the most basic interaction of fetching a [SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md): Stellar Info File:

<WalletCodeExample>

```kotlin
suspend fun anchorToml(): TomlInfo {
  return anchor.getInfo()
}
```

```typescript
let resp = await anchor.sep1();
```

```dart
var resp = await anchor.sep1();
```

```swift
let resp = try await anchor.sep1
```

</WalletCodeExample>

Below you can find all the SEPs the anchor class currently supports:

- [SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md): Stellar Info File as shown above
- [SEP-10](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md): explored on [Stellar Authentication](/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep10.mdx) section
- [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md): explored on [Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal](/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep24.mdx) section
- [SEP-6](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md): explored on [Programmatic Deposit and Withdrawal](/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep6.mdx) section
- [SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md): explored on [Providing KYC info](/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep6.mdx#providing-kyc-info) subsection
- [SEP-38](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0038.md): explored on [Quote](/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep38.mdx) section

Besides the SEPs supported by the anchor class the wallet SDK also has support for the [SEP-7](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0007.md) protocol which is explored on [URI Scheme to facilitate delegated signing](/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep7.mdx) section.
