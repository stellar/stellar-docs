X-Ray (Protocol 25) introduced Stellar’s first zero-knowledge proof primitives, marking an important milestone in a long-term strategy to equip developers with the infrastructure needed to build compliance-forward, privacy-preserving applications using zero-knowledge cryptography.

For more details on X-Ray, see this [blog post](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/announcing-stellar-x-ray-protocol-25).

## BN254

BN254 is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve defined over a 254-bit prime field, commonly used in zero-knowledge proof systems because it supports efficient bilinear pairings. These pairings enable succinct proof constructions where complex statements can be verified quickly on-chain or in constrained environments. BN254 is especially popular in blockchain ecosystems because its arithmetic and pairing operations are relatively efficient to implement and well supported by existing libraries and tooling.

### BN254 host functions

- g1_add - performs point addition in G1 (point on curve)
- g1_mul - performs scalar multiplication in G1 (point on curve)
- pairing_check - performs pairing operation on a vector of G1 point and a vector of G2 points

## Poseidon

Poseidon is a cryptographic hash function specifically designed for zero-knowledge proof systems, where efficiency inside arithmetic circuits is critical. Unlike traditional hashes such as SHA-256, Poseidon is optimized to minimize the number of constraints required in zk circuits by operating natively over finite fields used by zk-SNARKs. This makes it significantly faster and cheaper to prove and verify statements involving hashing, which is why Poseidon is widely used for commitments, Merkle trees, and nullifiers in zero-knowledge applications.

### Poseidon host functions

- poseidon - computes the Poseidon hash of the input field elements
- poseidon2 - computes the Poseidon hash of the input field elements
