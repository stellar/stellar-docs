## SwiftBasicPay

SwiftBasicPay is an open-source example iOS payment application that showcases how to integrate Stellar's powerful payment infrastructure into native Swift apps using the [Stellar Wallet SDK for Swift](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk) and the [Stellar iOS SDK](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk).

[SwiftBasicPay](https://github.com/Soneso/SwiftBasicPay) is maintained by a dedicated community developer, Soneso.

## Features

### Wallet Functionality

- **Authentication**: PIN-based security
- **Account Management**: Stellar account creation and management
- **Management of Assets**: Add/remove trust lines, asset overview
- **Payments**: Send and receive Stellar assets
- **Path Payments**: Cross-asset payments with automatic routing

### Anchor Integration

- Programatic deposits and withdrawals via anchors
- KYC compliance
- Interactive deposits/withdrawals with web integration

SwiftBasicPay integrates multiple Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) through the wallet SDK:

- **[SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md)**: Stellar TOML - Provides anchor metadata and service endpoints
- **[SEP-10](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md)**: Web Authentication - Proves account ownership to anchors
- **[SEP-6](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md)**: Deposit/Withdrawal API - Interacts with anchors programmatically
- **[SEP-9](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0009.md)**: Standard KYC Fields - Defines standard customer information fields
- **[SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md)**: KYC API - Customer information collection and verification
- **[SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md)**: Hosted Deposit/Withdrawal - Interactive web-based transfers

## Learning Topics

This app demonstrates how to:

1. **Create Stellar Wallets**: Account generation, key management
2. **Implement Management of Assets**: Add and remove trustlines to Stellar assets
3. **Implement Payments**: Simple and path payments
4. **Interact with Anchors**: SEP-1/10/6/12/24 integration

## Tutorial

A comprehensive tutorial walking through the development of this Stellar payment app is available in the [tutorial directory](https://github.com/Soneso/SwiftBasicPay/tree/main/tutorial) of the repository.

The tutorial covers secure data storage, authentication, account creation, assets management, payments, path payments, and anchor integration with step-by-step explanations of how the Stellar SDKs are used.
