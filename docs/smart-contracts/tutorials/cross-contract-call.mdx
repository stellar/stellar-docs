The [cross contract call example] demonstrates how to call a contract from
another contract.

:::info

In this example there are two contracts that are compiled separately, deployed
separately, and then tested together. There are a variety of ways to develop and
test contracts with dependencies on other contracts, and the Soroban SDK and
tooling is still building out the tools to support these workflows. Feedback
appreciated [here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v20.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v20.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `cross_contract/contract_b`
directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd cross_contract/contract_b
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="cross_contract/contract_a/src/lib.rs"
#[contract]
pub struct ContractA;

#[contractimpl]
impl ContractA {
    pub fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
        x.checked_add(y).expect("no overflow")
    }
}
```

```rust title="cross_contract/contract_b/src/lib.rs"
mod contract_a {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../contract_a/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_a_contract.wasm"
    );
}

#[contract]
pub struct ContractB;

#[contractimpl]
impl ContractB {
    pub fn add_with(env: Env, contract: Address, x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
        let client = contract_a::Client::new(&env, &contract);
        client.add(&x, &y)
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Cross contract calls are made by invoking another contract by its contract ID.

Contracts to invoke can be imported into your contract with the use of
`contractimport!(file = "...")`. The import will code generate:

- A `ContractClient` type that can be used to invoke functions on the contract.
- Any types in the contract that were annotated with `#[contracttype]`.

:::tip

The `contractimport!` macro will generate the types in the module it is used, so
it's a good idea to use the macro inside a `mod { ... }` block, or inside its
own file, so that the names of generated types don't collide with names of types
in your own contract.

### Contract A: The Contract to be Called

The contract to be called is Contract A. It is a simple contract that accepts
`x` and `y` parameters, adds them together and returns the result.

```rust title="cross_contract/contract_a/src/lib.rs"
#[contract]
pub struct ContractA;

#[contractimpl]
impl ContractA {
    pub fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
        x.checked_add(y).expect("no overflow")
    }
}
```

:::tip

The contract uses the `checked_add` method to ensure that there is no overflow,
and if there is overflow, panics rather than returning an overflowed value.
Rust's primitive integer types all have checked operations available as
functions with the prefix `checked_`.

:::

### Contract B: The Contract doing the Calling

The contract that does the calling is Contract B. It accepts a contract ID that
it will call, as well as the same parameters to pass through. In many contracts
the contract to call might have been stored as contract data and be retrieved,
but in this simple example it is being passed in as a parameter each time.

The contract imports Contract A into the `contract_a` module.

The `contract_a::Client` is constructed pointing at the contract ID passed in.

The client is used to execute the `add` function with the `x` and `y` parameters
on Contract A.

```rust title="cross_contract_calls/src/a.rs"
mod contract_a {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../contract_a/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_a_contract.wasm"
    );
}

#[contract]
pub struct ContractB;

#[contractimpl]
impl ContractB {
    pub fn add_with(env: Env, contract: Address, x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
        let client = contract_a::Client::new(&env, &contract);
        client.add(&x, &y)
    }
}
```

### Tests

Open the `cross_contract/contract_b/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="cross_contract/contract_b/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();

    // Register contract A using the imported Wasm.
    let contract_a_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, contract_a::Wasm);

    // Register contract B defined in this crate.
    let contract_b_id = env.register_contract(None, ContractB);

    // Create a client for calling contract B.
    let client = ContractBClient::new(&env, &contract_b_id);

    // Invoke contract B via its client. Contract B will invoke contract A.
    let sum = client.add_with(&contract_a_id, &5, &7);
    assert_eq!(sum, 12);
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contract A is registered with the environment using the imported Wasm.

```rust
let contract_a_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, contract_a::Wasm);
```

Contract B is registered with the environment using the contract type.

```rust
let contract_b_id = env.register_contract(None, ContractB);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`ContractB`, and the client is named `ContractBClient`. The client can be
constructed and used in the same way that client generated for Contract A can
be.

```rust
let client = ContractBClient::new(&env, &contract_b_id);
```

The client is used to invoke the `add_with` function on Contract B. Contract B
will invoke Contract A, and the result will be returned.

```rust
let sum = client.add_with(&contract_a_id, &5, &7);
```

The test asserts that the result that is returned is as we expect.

```rust
assert_eq!(sum, 12);
```

## Build the Contracts

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `soroban contract build` command. Both
`contract_call/contract_a` and `contract_call/contract_b` must be built, with `contract_a` being built first.

```sh
soroban contract build
```

Both `.wasm` files should be found in both contract `target` directories after building
both contracts:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_a_contract.wasm
```

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_b_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions. Both
contracts must be deployed.

```sh
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_a_contract.wasm \
    --id a
```

```sh
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_b_contract.wasm \
    --id b
```

Invoke Contract B's `add_with` function, passing in values for `x` and `y`
(e.g. as `5` and `7`), and then pass in the contract ID of Contract A.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --id b \
    -- \
    add_with \
    --contract_id a \
    --x 5 \
    --y 7
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
12
```

Contract B's `add_with` function invoked Contract A's `add` function to do
the addition.
