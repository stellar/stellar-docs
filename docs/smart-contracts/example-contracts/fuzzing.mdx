The [fuzzing example] demonstrates how to fuzz test Soroban contracts with [`cargo-fuzz`] and customize the input to fuzz tests with the [`arbitrary`] crate. It also demonstrates how to adapt fuzz tests into reusable property tests with the [`proptest`] and [`proptest-arbitrary-interop`] crates. It builds on the [timelock example].

## Run the Example

First go through the [setup] process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `v20.0.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```sh
git clone -b v20.0.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

You will also need the `cargo-fuzz` tool, and to run `cargo-fuzz` you will need a nightly Rust toolchain:

```sh
cargo install cargo-fuzz
rustup install nightly
```

To run one of the fuzz tests, navigate to the `fuzzing` directory and run the `cargo fuzz` subcommand with the `nightly` toolchain:

```sh
cd fuzzing
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1
```

:::info

If you're developing on MacOS you may need to add the `--sanitizer=thread` flag in order to fix some [known linking errors](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/1056).

:::

You should see output that begins like this:

The rest of this tutorial will explain how to set up this fuzz test, interpret this output, and remedy fuzzing failures.

## Background: Fuzz Testing and Rust

Fuzzing is a kind of testing where new inputs are repeatedly fed into a program in hopes of finding unexpected bugs. This style of testing is commonly employed to increase confidence in the correctness of security-sensitive software.

In Rust, fuzzing is most often performed with the [`cargo-fuzz`] tool, which drives LLVM's [`libfuzzer`], though other fuzzing tools are available.

[`libfuzzer`]: https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html

Soroban has built-in support for fuzzing Soroban contracts with `cargo-fuzz`.

`cargo-fuzz` is a mutation-based fuzzer: it runs a test program, passing it generated input; while the program is executing, the fuzzer monitors which branches the program takes, and which functions it executes; after execution the fuzzer uses this information to make decisions about how to _mutate_ the previously-used input to create new input that might discover more branches and functions; it then runs the test again with new input, repeating this process for potentially millions of iterations. In this way `cargo-fuzz` is able to automatically explore execution paths through the program that may never be seen by other types of tests.

If a fuzz tests panics or hard-crashes, `cargo-fuzz` considers it a failure and provides instructions for repeating the test with the failing inputs.

Fuzz testing is typically an exploratory and interactive process, with the programmer devising schemes for producing input that will stress the program in interesting ways, observing the behavior of the fuzz test, and iterating on the test itself.

Resolving a fuzz testing failure typically involves capturing the problematic input in a unit test. The fuzz test itself may or may not be kept, depending on determinations about the cost of maintaining the fuzzer vs the likelihood of it continuing to find bugs in the future.

While fuzzing non-memory-safe software tends to be more lucrative than fuzzing Rust software, it is still relatively common to find panics and other logic errors in Rust through fuzzing.

In Rust, multiple fuzzers are maintained by the [`rust-fuzz`] GitHub organization, which also maintains a "trophy case" of Rust bugs found through fuzzing.

[`rust-fuzz`]: https://github.com/rust-fuzz

## About the Example

The example used for this tutorial is based on the [`timelock`] example program, with some changes to demonstrate fuzzing.

[`timelock`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/timelock

The contract, `ClaimableBalanceContract`, allows one party to deposit an arbitrary quantity of a token to the contract, specifying additionally: the `claimants`, addresses that may withdraw from the contract; and the `time_bound`, a specification of when those claimants may withdraw from the account.

The `TimeBound` type looks like

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct TimeBound {
    pub kind: TimeBoundKind,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum TimeBoundKind {
    Before,
    After,
}
```

`ClaimableBalanceContract` has two methods, `deposit` and `claim`:

```rust
    pub fn deposit(
        env: Env,
        from: Address,
        token: Address,
        amount: i128,
        claimants: Vec<Address>,
        time_bound: TimeBound,
    );

    pub fn claim(
        env: Env,
        claimant: Address,
        amount: i128,
    );
```

`deposit` may only be successfully called once, after which `claim` may be called multiple times until the balance is completely drained, at which point the contract becomes dormant and may no longer be used.

## Fuzz Testing Setup

For these examples, the fuzz tests have been created for you, but normally you would use the `cargo fuzz init` command to create a fuzzing project as a subdirectory of the contract under test.

To do that you would navigate to the contract directory, in this case, `soroban-examples/fuzzing`, and execute

```sh
cargo fuzz init
```

A `cargo-fuzz` project is its own crate, which lives in the `fuzz` subdirectory of the crate being tested. This crate has its own `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, and another subdirectory, `fuzz_targets`, which contains Rust programs, each its own fuzz test.

Our `soroban-examples/fuzzing` directory looks like

- `Cargo.toml` - this is the contract's manifest
- `Cargo.lock`
- `src`
  - `lib.rs` - this is the contract code
- `fuzz` - this is the fuzzing crate
  - `Cargo.toml` - this is fuzzing crate's manifest
  - `Cargo.lock`
  - `fuzz_targets`
    - `fuzz_target_1.rs` - this is a single fuzz test
    - `fuzz_target_2.rs`

There are special considerations to note in the configuration of both the [contract's manifest] and the [fuzzing crate's manifest].

[contract's manifest]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/fuzzing/Cargo.toml
[fuzzing crate's manifest]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/fuzzing/fuzz/Cargo.toml

Within the contract's manifest one must specificy the crate type as both "cdylib" and "rlib":

```toml
[package]
name = "soroban-fuzzing-contract"
version = "0.0.0"
authors = ["Stellar Development Foundation <info@stellar.org>"]
license = "Apache-2.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
doctest = false

[features]
testutils = []
```

In most examples, a Soroban contract will only be a "cdylib", a Rust crate that is compiled to a dynamically loadable wasm module. For fuzzing though, the fuzzing crate needs to be able to link to the contract crate as a Rust library, an "rlib".

:::note

Note that cargo has a [feature/bug that inhibits LTO][lto] of cdylibs when a crate is both a "cdylib" and "rlib". This can be worked around by building the contract with either `soroban contract build` or `cargo rustc --crate-type cdylib` instead of the typical `cargo build`.

:::

[lto]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-docs/pull/476

The contract crate must also provide the "testutils" feature. When "testutils" is activated, the Soroban SDK's [`contracttype`] macro emits additional code needed for running fuzz tests.

[`contracttype`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/attr.contracttype.html

Within the fuzzing crate's manifest one must turn on the "testutils" features in both the contract crate and the `soroban-sdk` crate:

```toml
[package]
name = "soroban-fuzzing-contract-fuzzer"
version = "0.0.0"
publish = false
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata]
cargo-fuzz = true

[dependencies]
libfuzzer-sys = "0.4"
soroban-sdk = { version = "20.0.0", features = ["testutils"] }

[dependencies.soroban-fuzzing-contract]
path = ".."
features = ["testutils"]
```

## A Simple Fuzz Test

First let's look at [`fuzz_target_1.rs`]. This fuzz test does two things: it first deposits an arbitrary amount, then it claims an arbitrary amount.

[`fuzz_target_1.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/fuzzing/fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_target_1.rs

Again, you can run this fuzzer from the `soroban-examples/fuzzing` directory with the following command:

```sh
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1
```

The entry point and setup code for Soroban contract fuzz tests will typically look like:

```rust
#[derive(Arbitrary, Debug)]
struct Input {
    deposit_amount: i128,
    claim_amount: i128,
}

fuzz_target!(|input: Input| {
    let env = Env::default();

    env.mock_all_auths();

    env.ledger().set(LedgerInfo {
        timestamp: 12345,
        protocol_version: 1,
        sequence_number: 10,
        network_id: Default::default(),
        base_reserve: 10,
    });

    // Turn off the CPU/memory budget for testing.
    env.budget().reset_unlimited();

    // ... do fuzzing here ...
}
```

Instead of a `main` function, `cargo-fuzz` uses a special entry point defined by the [`fuzz_target!`] macro. This macro accepts a Rust closure that accepts `input`, any Rust type that implements the [`Arbitrary`] trait. Here we have defined a struct, `Input`, that derives `Arbitrary`.

[`fuzz_target!`]: https://docs.rs/libfuzzer-sys/latest/libfuzzer_sys/macro.fuzz_target.html
[`arbitrary`]: https://docs.rs/arbitrary/latest/arbitrary/trait.Arbitrary.html

`cargo-fuzz` will be responsible for generating `input` and repeatedly calling this closure.

To test a Soroban contract, we must set up an [`Env`]. Note that we have disabled the CPU and memory budget: this will allow us to fuzz arbitrarily complex code paths without worrying about running out of budget; we can assume that running out of budget during a transaction always correctly fails, canceling the transaction; it is not something we need to fuzz.

[`env`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Env.html

Refer to the [`fuzz_target_1.rs`] source code for additional setup for this contract.

This fuzzer performs two steps: deposit, then claim:

```rust
    // Deposit, then assert invariants.
    {
        let _ = fuzz_catch_panic(|| {
            timelock_client.deposit(
                &depositor_address,
                &token_contract_id,
                &input.deposit_amount,
                &vec![
                    &env,
                    claimant_address.clone(),
                ],
                &TimeBound {
                    kind: TimeBoundKind::Before,
                    timestamp: 123456,
                },
            );
        });

        assert_invariants(
            &env,
            &timelock_contract_id,
            &token_client,
            &input
        );
    }

    // Claim, then assert invariants.
    {
        let _ = fuzz_catch_panic(|| {
            timelock_client.claim(
                &claimant_address,
                &input.claim_amount,
            );
        });

        assert_invariants(
            &env,
            &timelock_contract_id,
            &token_client,
            &input
        );
    }
```

There are a number of potential strategies for writing fuzz tests. The strategy in this test is to make arbitrary, possibly weird and unrealistic, calls to the contract, disregarding whether those calls succeed or fail, and then to make assertions about the state of the contract.

Because there are many potential failure cases for any given contract call, we don't want to write a fuzz test by attempting to interpret the success or failure of any given call: that path leads to duplicating the contract's logic within the fuzz test. Instead we just want to ensure that, regardless of what happened during execution, the contract is never left in an invalid state.

Notice the use of the [`fuzz_catch_panic`] function to invoke the contract: This is a special function in the Soroban SDK for intercepting panics in a way that works with `cargo-fuzz`, and is needed to call contract functions that might fail. Without `fuzz_catch_panic` a panic from within a contract will immediately cause the fuzz test to fail, but in most cases a panic within a contract does not indicate a bug - it is simply how a Soroban contract cancels a transaction. `fuzz_catch_panic` returns a `Result`, but here we discard it.

[`fuzz_catch_panic`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/arbitrary/fn.fuzz_catch_panic.html

Finally, the `assert_invariants` function is where we make any assertions we can about the state of the contract:

```rust
/// Directly inspect the contract state and make assertions about it.
fn assert_invariants(
    env: &Env,
    timelock_contract_id: &Address,
    token_client: &TokenClient,
    input: &Input,
) {
    // Configure the environment to access the timelock contract's storage.
    env.as_contract(timelock_contract_id, || {
        let storage = env.storage();

        // Get the two datums owned by the timelock contract.
        let is_initialized = storage.has(&DataKey::Init);
        let claimable_balance = storage.get::<_, ClaimableBalance>(&DataKey::Balance);

        // Call the token client to get the balance held in the timelock contract.
        // This consumes contract execution budget.
        let actual_token_balance = token_client.balance(timelock_contract_id);

        // There can only be a claimaible balance after the contract is initialized,
        // but once the balance is claimed there is no balance,
        // but the contract remains initialized.
        // This is a truth table of valid states.
        assert!(match (is_initialized, claimable_balance.is_some()) {
            (false, false) => true,
            (false, true) => false,
            (true, true) => true,
            (true, false) => true,
        });

        assert!(actual_token_balance >= 0);

        if let Some(claimable_balance) = claimable_balance {
            let claimable_balance = claimable_balance.expect("balance");

            assert!(claimable_balance.amount > 0);
            assert!(claimable_balance.amount <= input.deposit_amount);
            assert_eq!(claimable_balance.amount, actual_token_balance);

            assert!(claimable_balance.claimants.len() > 0);
        }
    });
}
```

## Interpreting `cargo-fuzz` Output

This is a fuzzing failure, indicating a bug in either the fuzzer or the program. The details will be different.

Here is the same output, with less important lines trimmed:

```

        cargo fuzz run fuzz_target_1 fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_target_1/crash-04704b1542f61a21a4649e39023ec57ff502f627

```

The first line here is printed by our Rust program, and indicates exactly where the fuzzer panicked. The later lines indicate how to reproduce this failing case.

The first thing to do when you get a fuzzing failure is copy the command to reproduce the failure, so that you can use it to debug:

```sh
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1 fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_target_1/crash-04704b1542f61a21a4649e39023ec57ff502f627
```

Notice though that we need to tell `cargo` to use the nightly toolchain with the `+nightly` flag, something that `cargo-fuzz` doesn't print in its version of the command.

Another thing to notice is that by default, `cargo-fuzz` / `libfuzzer` does not print names of functions in its output, as in the stack trace:

```

```

Depending on how your system is set up, you may or may not have this problem. In order to print stack traces, `libfuzzer` needs the `llvm-symbolizer` program. On Ubuntu-based systems this can be installed with the `llvm-dev` package:

```sh
sudo apt install llvm-dev
```

After which `libfuzzer` will print demangled function names instead of addresses:

```

To continue, our program has a bug that should be easy to fix by inspecting the error and making a slight modification to the source.

Once the bug is fixed, the fuzzer will run continuously, producing output that looks like

```

And this output will continue until the fuzzer is killed with `Ctrl-C`.

Next, let's look at a single line of fuzzer output:

```
#177    NEW    cov: 8545 ft: 13821 corp: 43/1419b lim: 48 exec/s: 29 rss: 384Mb L: 32/48 MS: 1 ChangeASCIIInt-
```

The most important column here is `cov`. This is a cumulative measure of branches covered by the fuzzer. When this number stops increasing the fuzzer has probably explored as much of the program as it can. The other columns are described in the [`libfuzzer` documentation][lfout].

[lfout]: https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#output

Finally, lets look at this warning:

```
INFO: -max_len is not provided; libFuzzer will not generate inputs larger than 4096 bytes.
```

By default, `libfuzzer` only generates input up to 4096 bytes. In a lot of cases, this is probably reasonable, but `cargo-fuzz` can increase the `max_len` by appending the argument after `--`:

```sh
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1 -- -max_len=20000
```

All the options to libfuzzer can be listed with

```sh
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1 -- -help=1
```

See the [`libfuzzer` documentation] for more.

## Accepting Soroban Types as Input with the `SorobanArbitrary` Trait

Inputs to the `fuzz_target!` macro must implement the [`Arbitrary`] trait, which accepts bytes from the fuzzer driver and converts them to Rust values. Soroban types though are managed by the host environment, and so must be created from an [`Env`] value, which is not available to the fuzzer driver. The [`SorobanArbitrary`] trait, implemented for all Soroban contract types, exists to bridge this gap: it defines a _prototype_ pattern whereby the `fuzz_target` macro creates prototype values that the fuzz program can convert to contract values with the standard soroban conversion traits, [`FromVal`] or [`IntoVal`].

[`sorobanarbitrary`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/arbitrary/trait.SorobanArbitrary.html
[`fromval`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/trait.FromVal.html
[`intoval`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/trait.IntoVal.html

The types of prototypes are identified by the associated type, `SorobanArbitrary::Prototype`:

```rust
pub trait SorobanArbitrary:
    TryFromVal<Env, Self::Prototype> + IntoVal<Env, Val> + TryFromVal<Env, Val>
{
    type Prototype: for <'a> Arbitrary<'a>;
}
```

Types that implement `SorobanArbitrary` include:

- `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, `u64`, `i128`, `u128`, [`I256`], [`U256`], `()`, and `bool`,
- [`Error`],
- [`Bytes`], [`BytesN`], [`Vec`], [`Map`],
- [`Address`], [`Symbol`],
- [`Val`],

[`i256`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.I256.html
[`u256`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.U256.html
[`error`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Error.html
[`bytes`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Bytes.html
[`bytesn`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.BytesN.html
[`vec`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Vec.html
[`map`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Map.html
[`address`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Address.html
[`symbol`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Symbol.html
[`val`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Val.html

All user-defined contract types, those with the [`contracttype`] attribute, automatically derive `SorobanArbitrary`. Note that `SorobanArbitrary` is only derived when the "testutils" Cargo feature is active. This implies that, in general, to make a Soroban contract fuzzable, the contract crate must define a "testutils" Cargo feature, that feature should turn on the "soroban-sdk/testutils" feature, and the fuzz test, which is its own crate, must turn that feature on.

## A More Complex Fuzz Test

The [`fuzz_target_2.rs`] example, demonstrates the use of `SorobanArbitrary`, the advancement of time, and more advanced fuzzing techniques.

[`fuzz_target_2.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/fuzzing/fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_target_2.rs

This fuzz test takes a much more complex input, where some of the values are user-defined types exported from the contract under test. This test is structured as a simple interpreter, where the fuzzing harness provides arbitrarily-generated "steps", where each step is either a `deposit` command or a `claim` command. The test then treats each of these steps as a separate transaction: it maintains a snapshot of the blockchain state, and for each step creates a fresh environment in which to execute the contract call, simulating the advancement of time between each step. As in the previous example, assertions are made after each step.

The input to the fuzzer looks, in part, like:

```rust
#[derive(Arbitrary, Debug)]
struct Input {
    addresses: [<Address as SorobanArbitrary>::Prototype; NUM_ADDRESSES],
    #[arbitrary(with = |u: &mut Unstructured| u.int_in_range(0..=i128::MAX))]
    token_mint: i128,
    steps: RustVec<Step>,
}

#[derive(Arbitrary, Debug)]
struct Step {
    #[arbitrary(with = |u: &mut Unstructured| u.int_in_range(1..=u64::MAX))]
    advance_time: u64,
    command: Command, // `Command` not shown here - see the full source.
}
```

This shows how to use the `SorobanArbitrary::Prototype` associated type to define inputs to the fuzzer. A Soroban [`Address`] can only be created with an [`Env`], so cannot be generated directly by the `Arbitrary` trait. Instead we use the fully-qualified name of the `Address` prototype, `<Address as SorobanArbitrary>::Prototype`, to ask for `Address`'s prototype instead. Then when our fuzzer needs the `Address` we instantiate it with the [`FromVal`] trait:

```rust
let depositor_address = Address::from_val(&env, &input.addresses[cmd.depositor_index]);
```

---

The contract we are fuzzing is a _timelock_ contract, where calculation of time is crucial for correctness. So our testing must account for the advancement of time.

The contract defines a `TimeBound` type and accepts it in the `deposit` method:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct TimeBound {
    pub kind: TimeBoundKind,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

#[contractimpl]
impl ClaimableBalanceContract {
    pub fn deposit(
        env: Env,
        from: Address,
        token: Address,
        amount: i128,
        claimants: Vec<Address>,
        time_bound: TimeBound,
    ) {
        ...
    }
}
```

In our fuzzer, one of the possible commands issued each step is a `DepositCommand`:

```rust
#[derive(Arbitrary, Debug)]
struct DepositCommand {
    #[arbitrary(with = |u: &mut Unstructured| u.int_in_range(0..=NUM_ADDRESSES - 1))]
    depositor_index: usize,
    amount: i128,
    // This is an ugly way to get a vector of integers in range
    #[arbitrary(with = |u: &mut Unstructured| {
        u.arbitrary_len::<usize>().map(|len| {
            (0..len).map(|_| {
                u.int_in_range(0..=NUM_ADDRESSES - 1)
            }).collect::<Result<RustVec<usize>, _>>()
        }).and_then(|inner_result| inner_result)
    })]
    claimant_indexes: RustVec<usize>,
    time_bound: <TimeBound as SorobanArbitrary>::Prototype,
}
```

Notice that this command again uses the `SorobanArbitrary::Prototype` associated type to accept a `TimeBound` as input.

To advance time we maintain a [`LedgerSnapshot`], defined in the [`soroban-ledger-snapshot`] crate. For each step we call [`Env::from_snapshot`] to create a fresh environment to execute the step, then [`Env::to_snapshot`] to create a new snapshot to use in the following step.

[`ledgersnapshot`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-ledger-snapshot/latest/soroban_ledger_snapshot/struct.LedgerSnapshot.html
[`soroban-ledger-snapshot`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-ledger-snapshot
[`env::from_snapshot`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Env.html#method.from_snapshot
[`env::to_snapshot`]: https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/struct.Env.html#method.to_snapshot

Here is a simplified outline of how this works. See the full source code for details.

```rust
let init_snapshot = {
    let init_ledger = LedgerInfo {
        timestamp: 12345,
        protocol_version: 1,
        sequence_number: 10,
        network_id: Default::default(),
        base_reserve: 10,
        min_temp_entry_ttl: u32::MAX,
        min_persistent_entry_ttl: u32::MAX,
    };

    LedgerSnapshot::from(init_ledger, None)
};

let mut prev_env = Env::from_snapshot(init_snapshot);

for step in &config.input.steps {
    // Advance time and create a new env from snapshot.
    let curr_env = {
        let mut snapshot = prev_env.to_snapshot();
        snapshot.sequence_number += 1;
        snapshot.timestamp = snapshot.timestamp.saturating_add(step.advance_time);
        let env = Env::from_snapshot(snapshot);
        env.budget().reset_unlimited();
        env
    };

    step.command.exec(&config, &curr_env);
    prev_env = curr_env;
}
```

## Converting a Fuzz Test to a Property Test

In addition to fuzz testing, Soroban supports property testing in the style of quickcheck, by using the [`proptest`] and [`proptest-arbitrary-interop`] crates in conjunction with the `SorobanArbitrary` trait.

Property tests are similar to fuzz tests in that they generate randomized input. Property tests though do not instrument their test cases or mutate their input based on feedback from previous tests. Thus they are a weaker form of test.

The great benefit of property tests though is that they can be included in standard Rust test suites and require no extra tooling to execute. One might take advantage of this by interactively fuzzing to discover deep bugs, then convert fuzz tests to property tests to help prevent regressions.

The [`proptest.rs`] file is a translation of `fuzz_target_1.rs` to a property test.

[`proptest.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/fuzzing/src/proptest.rs
