title: Restore archived contract data using the Soroban CLI
hide_table_of_contents: true

If a contract's persistent storage entry has been archived, you can restore it using the Soroban CLI. For a storage entry that uses a simple `Symbol` as its storage key, you can run a command like so:

```bash
soroban contract restore \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --id C... \
    --key COUNTER \
    --durability persistent
```

If your storage entry uses a more advanced storage key, such as `Balance(Address)` in a token contract, you'll need to provide the key in a base64-encoded XDR form:

```bash
soroban contract restore \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --id C... \
    --key-xdr AAAABgAAAAHXkotywnA8z+r365/0701QSlWouXn8m0UOoshCtNHOYQAAAA4AAAAHQmFsYW5jZQAAAAAB \
    --durability persistent
```
