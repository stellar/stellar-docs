title: 5. Create an App
description: Make a frontend web app that interacts with your smart contracts.
---

With two smart contracts deployed to a public network, you can now create a web app that interacts with them via RPC calls. Let's get started.

## Initialize a frontend toolchain

You can build a Soroban app with any frontend toolchain or integrate it into any existing full-stack app. For this tutorial, we're going to use [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro works with React, Vue, Svelte, any other UI library, or no UI library at all. In this tutorial, we're not using a UI library. The Soroban-specific parts of this tutorial will be similar no matter what frontend toolchain you use.

If you're new to frontend, don't worry. We won't go too deep. But it will be useful for you to see and experience the frontend development process used by Soroban apps. We'll cover the relevant bits of JavaScript and Astro, but teaching all of frontend development and Astro is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Let's get started.

You're going to need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) v18.14.1 or greater. If you haven't yet, install it now.

We want to initialize our current project as an Astro project. To do this, we can again turn to the `soroban contract init` command, which has a `--frontend-template` flag that allows us to pass the url of a frontend template repository. As we learned in [Storing Data](storing-data.mdx#adding-the-increment-contract), `soroban contract init` will not overwrite existing files, and is safe to use to add to an existing project.

From our `getting-started-tutorial` directory, run the following command to add the Astro template files.

```sh
soroban contract init ./ \
  --frontend-template https://github.com/AhaLabs/soroban-astro-template
```

This will add the following to your project, which we'll go over in more detail below.

```bash

│   └── pages
│       └── index.astro
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Generate an NPM package for the Hello World contract

Before we open the new frontend files, let's generate an NPM package for the Hello World contract. This is our suggested way to interact with contracts from frontends. These generated libraries work with any JavaScript project (not a specific UI like React), and make it easy to work with some of the trickiest bits of Soroban, like encoding [XDR](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/fully-typed-contracts).

This is going to use the CLI command `soroban contract bindings typescript`:

```bash
soroban contract bindings typescript \
  --network testnet \
  --contract-id $(cat .soroban/contract-ids/soroban_hello_world_contract.txt) \
  --output-dir packages/hello_world
```

This project is set up as an NPM Workspace, and so the `hello_world` client library was generated in the `packages` directory at `packages/hello_world`.

We attempt to keep the code in these generated libraries readable, so go ahead and look around. Open up the new `packages/hello_world` directory in your editor. If you've built or contributed to Node projects, it will all look familiar. You'll see a `package.json` file, a `src` directory, a `tsconfig.json`, and even a README.

## Generate an NPM package for the Increment contract

Though we can run `soroban contract bindings typescript` for each of our contracts individually, the [soroban-astro-template](https://github.com/AhaLabs/soroban-astro-template) that we used as our template includes a very handy `initialize.js` script that will handle this for all of the contracts in our `contracts` directory.

In addition to generating the NPM packages, `initialize.js` will also:

- Generate and fund our Stellar account
- Build all of the contracts in the `contracts` dir
- Deploy our contracts
- Create handy contract clients for each contract

We have already taken care of the first three bullet points in earlier steps of this tutorial, so those tasks will be noops when we run `initialize.js`.

### Configure initialize.js

We need to make sure that `initialize.js` has all of the environment variables it needs before we do anything else. Copy the `.env.example` file over to `.env`. The environment variables set in `.env` are used by the `initialize.js` script.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Let's take a look at the contents of the `.env` file:

```
# Prefix with "PUBLIC_" to make available in Astro frontend files
PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Standalone Network ; February 2017"
PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc"

SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="me"
SOROBAN_NETWORK="standalone"

# env vars that begin with PUBLIC_ will be available to the client
PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=$SOROBAN_RPC_URL
```

This `.env` file defaults to connecting to a locally running network, but we want to configure our project to communicate with Testnet, since that is where we deployed our contracts. To do that, let's update the `.env` file to look like this:

```diff
# Prefix with "PUBLIC_" to make available in Astro frontend files
-PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Standalone Network ; February 2017"
+PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
-PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc"
+PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL="https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443"

-SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="me"
+SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="alice"
-SOROBAN_NETWORK="standalone"
+SOROBAN_NETWORK="testnet"
```

:::info

This `.env` file is used in the `initialize.js` script. When using the CLI, we can still use the network configuration we set up in the [Setup](./setup.mdx) step, or by passing the `--rpc-url` and `--network-passphrase` flags.

:::

### Run `initialize.js`

First let's install the Javascript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And then let's run `initialize.js`:

```bash
npm run init
```

As mentioned above, this script attempts to build and deploy our contracts, which we have already done. The script is smart enough to check if a step has already been taken care of, and is a no-op in that case, so it is safe to run more than once.

### Call the contract from the frontend

Now let's open up `src/pages/index.astro` and take a look at how the frontend code integrates with the NPM package we created for our contracts.

Here we can see that we're importing our generated `helloWorld` client from `../contracts/soroban_hello_world_contract`. We're then invoking the `hello` method and adding the result to the page.

```ts title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import Layout from "../layouts/Layout.astro";
import Card from "../components/Card.astro";
import helloWorld from "../contracts/soroban_hello_world_contract";
const { result } = await helloWorld.hello({ to: "you" });
const greeting = result.join(" ");
---

 ...

<h1>{greeting}</h1>
```

Let's see it in action! Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser. You should see the greeting from the contract!

You can try updating the `{ to: 'Soroban' }` argument. When you save the file, the page will automatically update.

:::info

When you start up the dev server with `npm run dev`, you will see similar output in your terminal as when you ran `npm run init`. This is because the `dev` script in package.json is set up to run `npm run init` and `astro dev`, so that you can ensure that your deployed contract and your generated NPM pacakage are always in sync. If you want to just start the dev server without the initialize.js script, you can run `npm run astro dev`.

:::

### What's happening here?

If you inspect the page (right-click, inspect) and refresh, you'll see a couple interesting things:

- The "Network" tab shows that there are no Fetch/XHR requests made. But RPC calls happen via Fetch/XHR! So how is the frontend calling the contract?
- There's no JavaScript on the page. But we just wrote some JavaScript! How is it working?

This is part of Astro's philosophy: the frontend should ship with as few assets as possible. Preferably zero JavaScript. When you put JavaScript in the [frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), Astro will run it at build time, and then replace anything in the `{...}` curly brackets with the output.

When using the development server with `npm run dev`, it runs the frontmatter code on the server, and injects the resulting values into the page on the client.

You can try building to see this more dramatically:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then check the `dist` folder. You'll see that it built an HTML and CSS file, but no JavaScript. And if you look at the HTML file, you'll see a static "Hello Soroban" in the `<h1>`.

During the build, Astro made a single call to your contract, then injected the static result into the page. This is great for contract methods that don't change, but probably won't work for most contract methods. Let's integrate with the `incrementor` contract to see how to handle interactive methods in Astro. -->

## Call the incrementor contract from the frontend

While `hello` is a simple view-only/read method, `increment` changes on-chain state. This means that someone needs to sign the transaction. So we'll need to add transaction-signing capabilities to the frontend.

The way signing works in a browser is with a _wallet_. Wallets can be web apps, browser extensions, standalone apps, or even separate hardware devices.

### Install Freighter Extension

Right now, the wallet that best supports Soroban is [Freighter](../guides/freighter/README.mdx). It is available as a Firefox Add-on, as well as extensions for Chrome and Brave. Go ahead and [install it now](https://freighter.app).

Once it's installed, open it up by clicking the extension icon. If this is your first time using Freighter, you will need to create a new wallet. Go through the prompts to create a password and save your recovery passphrase.

Go to Settings (the gear icon) → Preferences and toggle the switch to Enable Experimental Mode. Then go back to its home screen and select "Test Net" from the top-right dropdown. Finally, if it shows the message that your Stellar address is not funded, go ahead and click the "Fund with Friendbot" button.

Now you're all set up to use Freighter as a user, and you can add it to your app.

### Add Freighter

We're going to add a "Connect" button to the page that opens Freighter and prompts the user to give your web page permission to use Freighter. Once they grant this permission, the "Connect" button will be replaced with a message saying, "Signed in as [their public key]".

First, add [@stellar/freighter-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/freighter-api) as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @stellar/freighter-api
```

Now let's add a new component to the `src/components` directory called `ConnectFreighter.astro` with the following contents:

```html title="src/components/ConnectFreighter.astro"
<div id="freighter-wrap" class="wrap" aria-live="polite">
  <div class="ellipsis">
    <button data-connect aria-controls="freighter-wrap">Connect</button>
  </div>
</div>

<style>
  .wrap {
    text-align: center;
  }

  .ellipsis {
    line-height: 2.7rem;
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 12rem;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    text-align: center;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
</style>

<script>
  import { isAllowed, setAllowed, getUserInfo } from '@stellar/freighter-api';

  const wrap = document.querySelector('#freighter-wrap');
  const ellipsis = document.querySelector('#freighter-wrap .ellipsis');
  const button = document.querySelector('[data-connect]');

  async function getPk() {
    const { publicKey } = await getUserInfo();
    return publicKey;
  }

  async function setLoggedIn() {
    const publicKey = await getPk();
    ellipsis.innerHTML = `Signed in as ${publicKey}`;
    ellipsis.title = publicKey;
  }

  if (await isAllowed()) {
    if (await getPk()) setLoggedIn();
    else wrap.innerHTML = 'Freighter is locked.<br>Sign in & refresh the page.';
  } else {
    button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
      button.disabled = true;
      await setAllowed();
      await setLoggedIn();
    });
  }
</script>
```

Some of this may look surprising. `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the middle of the page? Uncreative class names like `wrap`? `import` statements in a `<script>`? Top-level `await`? What's going on here?

Astro automatically scopes the styles within a component to that component, so there's no reason for us to come up with a clever names for our classes.

And all the `script` declarations get bundled together and included intelligently in the page. Even if you use the same component multiple times, the script will only be included once. And yes, you can use top-level `await`.

You can read more about this in [Astro's page about client-side scripts](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/).

The code itself here is pretty self-explanatory. We import a few methods from `@stellar/freighter-api` to check if the user is logged in. If they already are, then `isAllowed` returns `true`. If it's been more than a day since they've used the Freighter extension, then the `publicKey` will be blank, so we tell them to unlock Freighter and refresh the page. If `isAllowed` and the `publicKey` both look good, we replace the contents of the `div` with the signed-in message, replacing the button. Otherwise, we add a click handler to the button to prompt the user to connect Freighter with `setAllowed`. Once they do, we again replace the contents of the `div` with the signed-in message. The [`aria` stuff](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) ensures that screen readers will read the new contents when they're updated.

Now we can import the component in the frontmatter of `pages/index.astro`:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 ---
 import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
 import Card from '../components/Card.astro';
 import helloWorld from "../contracts/soroban_hello_world_contract";
+import ConnectFreighter from '../components/ConnectFreighter.astro';
 ...
```

And add it right below the `<h1>`:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
<h1>{greeting}</h1>
+<ConnectFreighter />
```

If you're no longer running your dev server, go ahead and restart it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the page and click the "Connect" button. You should see Freighter pop up and ask you to sign in. Once you do, the button should be replaced with a message saying, "Signed in as [your public key]".

Now you're ready to sign the call to `increment`!

### Call `increment`

Now we can import the `increment` contract client from `soroban_increment_contract` and start using it. We'll again create a new Astro component. Create a new file at `src/components/Counter.astro` with the following contents:

```html title="src/components/Counter.astro"
<strong>Incrementor</strong><br />
Current value: <strong id="current-value" aria-live="polite">???</strong><br />
<br />
<button data-increment aria-controls="current-value">Increment</button>

<script>
  import incrementor from "../contracts/soroban_increment_contract";

  const button = document.querySelector("[data-increment]");
  const currentValue = document.querySelector("#current-value");

  button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
    button.disabled = true;
    button.classList.add("loading");
    currentValue.innerHTML =
      currentValue.innerHTML +
      '<span class="visually-hidden"> – updating…</span>';

    const tx = await incrementor.increment();
    const { result } = await tx.signAndSend();

    // Only use `innerHTML` with contract values you trust!
    // Blindly using values from an untrusted contract opens your users to script injection attacks!
    currentValue.innerHTML = result;

    button.disabled = false;
    button.classList.remove("loading");
  });
</script>
```

This should be somewhat familiar by now. We have a `script` that, thanks to Astro's build system, can `import` modules directly. We use `document.querySelector` to find the elements defined above. And we add a `click` handler to the button, which calls `increment` and updates the value on the page. It also sets the button to `disabled` and adds a `loading` class while the call is in progress to prevent the user from clicking it again and visually communicate that something is happening. For people using screen readers, the loading state is communicated with the [visually-hidden](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) span, which will be announced to them thanks to the `aria` tags we saw before.

The biggest difference from the call to `greeter.hello` is that this transaction gets executed in two steps. The initial call to `increment` constructs a Soroban transaction and then makes an RPC call to _simulate_ it. For read-only calls like `hello`, this is all you need, so you can get the `result` right away. For write calls like `increment`, you then need to `signAndSend` before the transaction actually gets included in the ledger.

:::info

Destructuring `{ result }`: If you're new to JavaScript, you may not know what's happening with those `const { result }` lines. This is using JavaScript's _destructuring_ feature. If the thing on the right of the equals sign is an object, then you can use this pattern to quickly grab specific keys from that object and assign them to variables. You can also name the variable something else, if you like. For example, try changing the code above to:

```ts
const { result: newValue } = ...
```

:::

Also, notice that you don't need to manually specify Freighter as the wallet in the call to `increment`. This may change in the future, but while Freighter is the only game in town, these generated libraries automatically use it. If you want to override this behavior, you can pass a `wallet` option; check the latest `Wallet` interface in [the template source](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools/blob/main/cmd/crates/soroban-spec-typescript/src/project_template/src/method-options.ts) for details.

Now let's use this component. In `pages/index.astro`, first import it:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 ---
 import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
 import Card from '../components/Card.astro';
 import helloWorld from "../contracts/soroban_hello_world_contract";
 import ConnectFreighter from '../components/ConnectFreighter.astro';
+import Counter from '../components/Counter.astro';
 ...
```

Then use it. Let's replace the contents of the `instructions` paragraph with it:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 <p class="instructions">
-  To get started, open the directory <code>src/pages</code> in your project.<br />
-  <strong>Code Challenge:</strong> Tweak the "Welcome to Astro" message above.
+  <Counter />
 </p>
```

Check the page; if you're still running your dev server, it should have already updated. Click the "Increment" button; you should see a Freighter confirmation. Confirm, and... the value updates! 🎉

There's obviously some functionality missing, though. For example, that `???` is a bummer. But our `increment` contract doesn't give us a way to query the current value without also updating it.

Before you try to update it, let's streamline the process around building, deploying, and generating clients for contracts.

## Take it further

If you want to take it a bit further and make sure you understand all the pieces here, try the following:

- Make a `src/contracts` folder with a `greeter.ts` and an `incrementor.ts`. Move the `new Contract({ ... })` logic into those files. You may also want to extract the `rpcUrl` variable to a `src/contracts/utils.ts` file.
- Add a `get_value` method to the `increment` contract, and use it to display the current value in the `Counter` component. When you run `npm run dev`, the `initialize` script will run and update the contract and the generated client.
- Add a "Decrement" button to the `Counter` component.
- [Deploy](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) your frontend. You can do this quickly and for free [with GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/). If you get stuck installing soroban-cli and deploying contracts on GitHub, check out [how we did this](https://github.com/AhaLabs/soroban-tutorial-project/commit/c1f4cfde1bbaf059507100767ee6b43d29b42914).
- Rather than using NPM scripts for everything, try using a more elegant script runner such as [just](https://github.com/casey/just). The existing npm `scripts` can then call `just`, such as `"setup": "just setup"`.
- Update the README to explain what this project is and how to use it to potential collaborators and employers 😉

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong. As a first step when troubleshooting, you may want to [clone our tutorial repository](https://github.com/AhaLabs/soroban-tutorial-project) and see if the problem happens there, too. If it happens there, too, then it may be a temporary problem with the Soroban network.

Here are some common issues and how to fix them.

### Call to `hello` fails

Sometimes the call to `hello` can start failing. You can obviously stub out the call and define `result` some other way to troubleshoot.

One of the common problems here is that the contract becomes [archived](../../learn/smart-contract-internals/state-archival.mdx). To check if this is the problem, you can re-run `npm run init`.

If you're still having problems, join our Discord (link above) or [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-docs/issues/new/choose).

### All contract calls start throwing `403` errors

This means that Testnet is down, and you probably just need to wait a while and try again.

## Wrapping up

Some of the things we did in this section:

- We learned about Astro's no-JS-by-default approach
- We added Astro components and learned how their `script` and `style` tags work
- We saw how easy it is to interact with Soroban contracts from JavaScript by generating client libraries using `soroban contract bindings typescript`
- We learned about wallets and Freighter

At this point, you've seen a full end-to-end example of building on Soroban! What's next? You choose! You can:

- See more complex example contracts in the [Tutorials](../example-contracts/README.mdx) section.
- Learn more about the [internal architecture and design](../../learn/smart-contract-internals/README.mdx) of Soroban.
- Check out a more full-featured [example app](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp), which uses React rather than vanilla JavaScript and Next.js rather than Astro. This app also has a more complex setup & initialization process, with the option of using a [locally-hosted RPC node](/network/soroban-rpc/admin-guide).
