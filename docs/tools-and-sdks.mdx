## Tools

These tools make it easier for developers to use and understand the Stellar network and launch their project.

### [Account Viewer](https://accountviewer.stellar.org/)

A stripped-down wallet where you can check an account’s XLM balance and send simple payments on the Testnet and Pubnet.

### [Albedo](https://albedo.link/)

Allows other Stellar apps to request transaction signing or identity verification.

### [Anchor Directory](https://resources.stellar.org/anchors?)

View all anchors on Stellar, their currencies, and where they operate.

### [Asset Sandbox](https://stellar.cheesecakelabs.com/?utm_source=stellar&utm_medium=landing-page&utm_campaign=stellar-asset-sandbox)

A sandbox supported by SDF and [Cheesecake Labs](https://cheesecakelabs.com/) for businesses to experiment with asset issuance on Stellar's test network.

### [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stellar.org/)

Displays the current status of the Testnet and Pubnet. Monitor fee stats, recent operations, lumen supply, and more.

### [Demo Wallet](https://demo-wallet.stellar.org/)

Lets financial application developers test their integrations and learn how Stellar ecosystem protocols (SEPs) work; use the demo wallet to test Regulated Assets (SEP-8), Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal (SEP-24), and Cross-Border Payments (SEP-31) with any home domain that has a Stellar Info File (also known as SEP-1, or a stellar.toml file).

### [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/)

SDF’s flagship non-custodial wallet extension that enables you to sign Stellar transactions via your browser.

### [Kelp](https://kelpbot.io/)

A free, customizable, open-source trading bot for the Stellar universal marketplace.

### [Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#?network=test)

The Stellar Laboratory is a GUI where you can use and learn about the Stellar network on the Testnet and Pubnet. You can create accounts, construct and submit transactions, and query Horizon endpoints without needing to know code.

### [Node Explorer](https://stellarbeat.io/)

View Stellar network nodes and visualize consensus with Stellarbeat.

### [Polaris](https://django-polaris.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

An extendable django app that makes it easy for anchors to facilitate cross-border payments and enable deposits and withdrawals; run a web server supporting any combination of SEP-1, 6, 10, 12, and 24.

### [Status Page](https://status.stellar.org/)

Tracks network incidents and scheduled maintenance for the Testnet and Pubnet. Subscribe to updates to be notified about important events, including protocol upgrades and Testnet resets.

### [Transaction Explorer](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public)

Explore transactions and network activity with StellarExpert. Check stats specific to an asset code, transaction hash, account address, or ledger sequence number.

### [Tools for Stellar Core and Horizon Operators](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/tools)

A GitHub repository with tools like Stellar Archivist (for Stellar Core archive maintenance) and Horizon cmp (compares responses of two Horizon servers).

## SDK library

Interact with the Stellar network using the SDK in your preferred language. The JavaScript, Java, and Go SDKs are maintained by SDF and the rest are maintained by dedicated community developers. All SDKs are open-source; file a GitHub issue or pull request in the specific SDK repository if you have questions or suggestions.

Each SDK has its own source code and documentation. Learn how to use a specific SDK by referring to the documentation- most docs offer practical examples that demonstrate how to construct and submit transactions and interact with Horizon endpoints.

### Java

### Go

This SDK is split up into separate packages, all of which you can find in the [Go monorepo README](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/docs/reference/readme.md). The two key libraries for interacting with Horizon are `txnbuild`, which enables the construction, signing, and encoding of Stellar transactions, and `horizonclient`, which provides a web client for interfacing with Horizon server REST endpoints to retrieve ledger information and submit transactions built with `txnbuild`.
