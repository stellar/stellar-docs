[upgradeable contract example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0/upgradeable_contract

## Code

The example contains both an "old" and "new" contract, where we upgrade from "old" to "new". The code below is for the "old" contract.

```rust title="upgradeable_contract/old_contract/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]

use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, contracttype, Address, BytesN, Env};

#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
enum DataKey {
    Admin,
}

#[contract]
pub struct UpgradeableContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl UpgradeableContract {
    pub fn init(e: Env, admin: Address) {
        e.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Admin, &admin);
    }

    pub fn version() -> u32 {
        1
    }

    pub fn upgrade(e: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
        let admin: Address = e.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Admin).unwrap();
        admin.require_auth();

        e.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
    }
}

```

## How it works

The upgrade is only possible because the contract calls `e.update_current_contract_wasm`, with the wasm hash of the new contract as a parameter. The contract ID does **not** change. Note that the contract required authorization from an admin before upgrading. This is to prevent anyone from upgrading the contract. You can read more about the `update_current_contract_wasm` function in the Soroban Rust SDK [here].

```rust
pub fn upgrade(e: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
    let admin: Address = e.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Admin).unwrap();
    admin.require_auth();

    e.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
}
```

The `update_current_contract_wasm` host function will also emit a `SYSTEM` contract [event] that contains the old and new wasm reference, allowing downstream users to be notified when a contract they use is updated. The event structure will have `topics = ["executable_update", old_executable: ContractExecutable, old_executable: ContractExecutable]` and `data = []`.

[event]: ../../soroban-internals/events.mdx#event-types

## Tests

Open the `upgradeable_contract/old_contract/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="upgradeable_contract/old_contract/srctest.rs"
#![cfg(test)]

use soroban_sdk::{testutils::Address as _, Address, BytesN, Env};

mod old_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file =
            "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm"
    );
}

mod new_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../new_contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm"
    );
}

fn install_new_wasm(e: &Env) -> BytesN<32> {
    e.install_contract_wasm(new_contract::Wasm)
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    // Note that we use register_contract_wasm instead of register_contract
    // because the old contracts Wasm is expected to exist in storage.
    let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, old_contract::Wasm);

    let client = old_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let admin = Address::random(&env);
    client.init(&admin);

    assert_eq!(1, client.version());

    let new_wasm_hash = install_new_wasm(&env);

    client.upgrade(&new_wasm_hash);
    assert_eq!(2, client.version());

    // new_v2_fn was added in the new contract, so the existing
    // client is out of date. Generate a new one.
    let client = new_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    assert_eq!(1010101, client.new_v2_fn());
}

```

We first import wasm files for both contracts -

```rust
mod old_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file =
            "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm"
    );
}

mod new_contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../new_contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm"
    );
}
```

We register the old contract, intialize it with an admin, and verify the version
it reutrns. The note in the code below is important-

```rust
// Note that we use register_contract_wasm instead of register_contract
// because the old contracts Wasm is expected to exist in storage.
let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, old_contract::Wasm);

let client = old_contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
let admin = Address::random(&env);
client.init(&admin);

assert_eq!(1, client.version());
```

We install the new contract's Wasm

```rust
let new_wasm_hash = install_new_wasm(&env);
```

Then we run the upgrade, and verify that the upgrade worked.

```rust
client.upgrade(&new_wasm_hash);
assert_eq!(2, client.version());
```

## Build the Contract

To build the contract `.wasm` files, run `soroban contract build` in both
`upgradeable_contract/old_contract` and `upgradeable_contract/new_contract` in
that order.

Both `.wasm` files should be found in both contract `target` directories after building
both contracts:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm
```

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions. Deploy the old contract and install the wasm for the new contract.

```sh
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_old_contract.wasm \
    --id a
```

```sh
soroban contract install \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_upgradeable_contract_new_contract.wasm
```

You should see this Wasm hash from the install command:

```
c30c71a382438ed7e56669ba172aa862cc813d093b8d2f45e85b47ba38a89ddc
```

You also need to call the `init` method so the `admin` is set. This requires us
to setup som identities.

```sh
soroban config identity generate acc1 && \
soroban config identity address acc1
```

Example output:

```
GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B
```

Now call `init` with this key (make sure to substitute with the key you generated).

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --id a \
    -- \
    init \
    --admin GAJGHZ44IJXYFNOVRZGBCVKC2V62DB2KHZB7BEMYOWOLFQH4XP2TAM6B
```

Invoke the `version` function.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --id a \
    -- \
    version
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
1
```

Now upgrade the contract. Notice the `--source` must be the
identity name matching the address passed to the `init` function.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --source acc1 \
    --id a \
    -- \
    upgrade \
    --new_wasm_hash c30c71a382438ed7e56669ba172aa862cc813d093b8d2f45e85b47ba38a89ddc
```

Invoke the `version` function again.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --id a \
    -- \
    version
```

Now that the contract was upgraded, you'll see a new version.

```json
2
```
