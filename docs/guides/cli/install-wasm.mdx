title: Install Wasm Bytecode
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

To use the Soroban CLI to install a compiled smart contract on the ledger, use the `soroban contract install` command:

```bash
soroban contract install \
    --source S... \
    --network testnet \
    --wasm ../relative/path/to/soroban_contract.wasm
```

:::note

Note this command will return the hash ID of the Wasm bytecode, rather than an address for a contract instance.
