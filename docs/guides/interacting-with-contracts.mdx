title: Interacting with contracts

## Three types of interactions

### Function call

A function call is the simplest and least expensive kind of contract
interaction. A function call does exactly what you would expect a contract call
to do in any other software development context: the contract transfers control
and data to another part of the _same_ contract. Because a function call always
transfers control to the same contract, they do not change the values returned
by `get_current_contract` and `get_invoking_contract`. A function call is the
only way to access the private methods of a contract, although it can also call
be used to access the public methods of a contract.

To perform a function call, simply make a Rust function call.

### Contract invocation

A contract invocation is a more powerful and more expensive kind of contract
interaction. A contract invocation is similar to starting a new process because
the code that runs will be in a separate address space, meaning that they do
not share any data other than what was passed in the invocation. While a
contract invocation typically transfers control to a _different_ contract, it
is possible to transfer control to the currently running contract. Regardless
of whether the contract that receives control is a different contract or the
currently running contract, the value returned by `get_invoking_contract` will
be the previous value of `get_current_contract`. A contract invocation can only
access the public methods of a contract.

If a contract contains a public function `f`, then invoking `f` can be done by
making a Rust function call to `f::invoke`.

Some contracts, such as the token contract, only export the contract invocation
functions. In doing so, they are able to assign those functions friendly names.
For example,
[initialize](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/contract.rs#L55-L57)

```rust
#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl TokenTrait for Token {
    fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, decimal: u32, name: Binary, symbol: Binary) {
```

is [exported](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/lib.rs#L26)
as

```rust
pub use crate::contract::initialize::invoke as initialize;
```

This function is then easily [called by the liquidity pool contract](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/4060d3bd5ee7846020b68ee583665a4d4cf4b315/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs#L164-L171).

### Operation

An operation is the ultimate entrypoint of every contract interaction. An
operation transfers control and external data to a contract, allowing execution
to begin.

## Interacting with contracts in tests

[Debugging contracts](../under-the-hood/debugging-contracts.mdx) explains that
it is much more convenient to debug using native code than WASM. Given that you
are testing native code, it is tempting to interact with your contract directly
using function calls. If you attempt this approach, you will find that it
doesn't always work. Function call interactions do not set the environment into
the correct state for contract execution, so functions involving contract data
and determining the current or invoking contract will not work.

When writing tests, it is important to always interact with contracts through
contract invocation. In a production setting, contract invocation will execute
WASM bytecode loaded from the ledger. So how does this work if you are testing
native code? You must register your contract with the environment so it knows
what functions are available and how to call them. While this sounds complex,
the `contractimpl` procedural macro automatically generates almost all of the
code to do this. All you have to do is write a small [stub](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/testutils.rs#L12-L15)
to actually call the generated code, such as

```rust
pub fn register_test_contract(e: &Env, contract_id: &[u8; 32]) {
    let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(e, *contract_id);
    e.register_contract(&contract_id, crate::contract::Token {});
}
```

Some contracts, such as the token contract, also provide a [friendlier interface](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/testutils.rs#L26-L191)
to facilitate testing. There are many ways these interfaces might make testing
easier, but one common one is to allow automatic message signing by passing a
[ed25519_dalek::Keypair](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/latest/ed25519_dalek/struct.Keypair.html).

Note that everything described in this section is only available if the
`testutils` feature is enabled.

### Example

This machinery can also be used to test multiple contracts together. For
example, the single offer contract test case [creates a token](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/56fef787395b5aed7cd7b19772cca28e21b3feb5/single_offer/src/test.rs#L22).
