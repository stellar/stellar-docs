With a funded Testnet account, you can now sign Soroban XDRs using dApps that are integrated with Freighter. An example of an integrated dApp is Stellar's [Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#txsigner).

1. On the Lab's transaction signer, enter a Soroban XDR into the form field.

2. Click `Sign with Freighter`.

3. Freighter will open with the details of the XDR. Click `Approve` to sign or `Reject` to dismiss without a signature.

4. If approved, Freighter will transmit a signed XDR back to the Lab.
