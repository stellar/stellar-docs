[Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) is a browser extension wallet provided by the Stellar Development Foundation. It provides users a way to interact with Soroban tokens directly from the web browser.

## Setup

1. Install the Freighter browser extension.

2. Create a keypair or import an existing account using a mnemonic phrase to complete setup.

3. Next, switch to `Experimental Mode` to enable the Soroban SDK. In the extension, click the gear in the lower right corner and then navigate to `Preferences`. Toggle on `Experimental Mode`.

4. After switching to `Experimental Mode`, you should automatically be switched to the Futurenet network. Fund your account on Futurenet using Friendbot. For convenience, you can do so in the Stellar [Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet).

## Enable Soroban Tokens

With a funded Futurenet account and `Experimental Mode` enabled, you can now add Soroban tokens to your Freighter wallet.

1. On the Freighter account screen, click this `Manage Assets` button at the bottom of the screen.

2. You will now see a button to `Add Soroban token` at the bottom of the screen. Click this `Add Soroban token` button.

3. On the next screen, enter the Token ID of the token you want to add to Freighter and click `Add New Token`.

4. You will now see your token's balance on Freighter's account page. Clicking on the balance will show a history of payments sent using this token.

## Send Token Payments

Once you have added a Soroban token to your Freighter wallet, you can now send a payment of that token directly from Freighter.

1. On the Freighter account screen, click the `Send Payment` icon in the upper right of the screen.

2. Enter a recipient public key. Click `Continue`.

3. Select your token from the asset dropdown at the bottom of the screen and enter a token amount. Click `Continue`.

4. Enter a memo (optional). Click `Review Send`.

5. Review the details of your payment. Click `Send`.

## Sign Soroban XDRs

With a funded Futurenet account and `Experimental Mode` enabled, you can now sign Soroban XDRs using dApps that are integrated with Freighter. An example of an integrated dApp is Stellar's [Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#txsigner?network=futurenet).

1. On the Lab's transaction signer, enter a Soroban XDR into the form field.

2. Click `Sign with Freighter`.

3. Freighter will open with the details of the XDR. Click `Approve` to sign or `Reject` to dismiss without a signature.

4. If approved, Freighter will transmit a signed XDR back to the Lab.

## As a dApp Provider, Prompt Freighter to Sign Transactions (Advanced)

If you're building a JS dApp, easily sign Soroban transactions using the [Freighter browser extension](https://www.freighter.app/) and its corresponding client library [@stellar/freighter-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/freighter-api):

1. Follow the setup instructions above.

2. Now, you can use the `signTransaction` [method](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/guide/usingFreighterNode) from `@stellar/freighter-api` in your dApp to sign Soroban XDRs using the account in Freighter.

3. Upon calling `signTransaction`, Freighter will open and prompt the user to sign the transaction. Approving the transaction will return the signed XDR to the requesting dApp.
