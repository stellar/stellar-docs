Writing tests for Soroban contracts involves writing Rust code using the Rust
test facilitiaties and toolchain that you'd use for testing any Rust code.

Given a simple contract like the contract demonstrated in [Write a
Contract](write-a-contract.mdx).

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        const GREETING: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("Hello");
        vec![&env, GREETING, to]
    }
}
```

A simple test will look like this.

```

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::{Contract, hello};
    use soroban_sdk::{vec, Env, FixedBinary};

    #[test]
    fn test() {
        let env = Env::default();
        let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
        env.register_contract(&contract_id, Contract);

        let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("Dev"));
        assert_eq!(
            words,
            vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("Dev"),]
        );
    }
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Host environment that the contract will run it.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contracts must be registered with the environment with a contract ID, which is a
32-byte value. In many cases it is sufficient to use a simple zero ID, however
if the test will deploy the contract multiple times, or deploy multiple
contracts, each should use their own IDs.

```rust
let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have an `invoke` function generated, that can be
used to invoke the contract function within the environment.

```rust
let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("SourBun"));
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:
```rust
assert_eq!(
    words,
    vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("SourBun"),]
);
```

## Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.
