title: Build a WASM File
---

To build a Soroban contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm
```
