Soroban contracts are small programs written in the [Rust] programming language.

To build and develop contracts you need only a couple prerequisites:

- A [Rust] toolchain
- An editor that supports Rust
- [Soroban CLI]

## Install Rust

If you use macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, the simplest method to install
a Rust toolchain is to install `rustup`. Install `rustup` with the following
command.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

If you use Windows, or need an alternative method of installing Rust, check out:

## Configure an Editor

Many editors have support for Rust. Visit the following link to find out how to
configure your editor:  
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools

A popular editor is Visual Studio Code:

- [Visual Studio Code] editor.
- [Rust Analyzer] for Rust language support.
- [CodeLLDB] for step-through-debugging.

## Install the Soroban CLI

The Soroban CLI can execute Soroban contracts in the same environment the
contract will execute on network, however in a local sandbox.

Install the Soroban CLI using `cargo install`.

```sh
cargo install --locked --version 0.1.0 soroban-cli
```

:::caution
The `soroban` is in early development. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/soroban/issues/new/choose).
