Soroban contracts are small programs written in the [Rust] programming language.

To build and develop contracts you need only a couple prerequisites:

- A [Rust] toolchain
- An editor that supports Rust
- [Soroban CLI]

## Install Rust

If you use macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, the simplest method to install
a Rust toolchain is to install `rustup`. Install `rustup` with the following
command.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows, or need an alternative method of installing Rust, check out:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Install the target

Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Configure an Editor

Many editors have support for Rust. Visit the following link to find out how to
configure your editor:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools

A popular editor is Visual Studio Code:

- [Visual Studio Code] editor.
- [Rust Analyzer] for Rust language support.
- [CodeLLDB] for step-through-debugging.

[CodeLLDB]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb

## Install the Soroban CLI

The Soroban CLI can execute Soroban contracts in the same environment the
contract will execute on network, however in a local sandbox.

Install the Soroban CLI using `cargo install`.

```bash
cargo install --locked --version 0.9.4 soroban-cli
```

### Usage

Run the `soroban` command and you should see output like below.

```bash
soroban
```

```bash
$ soroban
Build, deploy, & interact with contracts; set identities to sign with; configure networks; generate keys; and more.

Intro: https://soroban.stellar.org
CLI Reference: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools/tree/main/docs/soroban-cli-full-docs.md

Usage: soroban [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  contract    Tools for smart contract developers
  config      Read and update config
  events      Watch the network for contract events
  lab         Experiment with early features and expert tools
  version     Print version information
  completion  Print shell completion code for the specified shell

Options:
      --global                     Use global config
  -f, --filter-logs <FILTER_LOGS>  Filter logs output. To turn on "soroban_cli::log::footprint=debug" or off "=off". Can also use env var `RUST_LOG`
  -q, --quiet                      Do not write logs to stderr including `INFO`
  -v, --verbose                    Log DEBUG events
      --very-verbose               Log DEBUG and TRACE events
      --list                       List installed plugins. E.g. `soroban-hello`
  -h, --help                       Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version                    Print version

TESTING_OPTIONS:
      --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>
```

:::info

**Protip:** You can use `soroban completion` to generate shell completion for `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell`, and `zsh`. You should absolutely try it out. It will feel like a super power!!

To enable autocomplete in the current bash shell, run:

```bash
source <(soroban completion --shell bash)
```

To enable autocomplete permanently in future bash shells, run:

```bash
echo "source <(soroban completion --shell bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Users of non-bash shells may need to adapt the above commands to suit their needs.
