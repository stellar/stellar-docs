title: 2. Storing Data
description: Write a simple Soroban contract that stores and retrieves data.
---

The [increment example] demonstrates how to write a simple contract that stores data, with a single function that increments an internal counter and returns the value.

[increment example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.7.0/increment

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `v0.7.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.7.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `increment` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd increment
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
count: U32(0)
count: U32(1)
count: U32(2)
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="increment/src/lib.rs"
const COUNTER: Symbol = Symbol::short("COUNTER");

pub struct IncrementContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementContract {
    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> u32 {
        let mut count: u32 = env
            .storage()
            .get(COUNTER)
            .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
            .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.
        log!(&env, "count: {}", count);
        count += 1;
        env.storage().set(COUNTER, count);
        count
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Open the `increment/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Contract Data Keys

Contract data is associated with a key. The key is the value that can be used at
a later time to lookup the value.

`Symbol` is a short (up to 32 characters long) string type with limited 
character space (only `a-zA-z0-9_` characters are allowed). Identifiers like 
contract function names are represented by `Symbol`s.

Short `Symbol`s up to 9 characters long can be pre-computed at compile time using
`Symbol::short`.

```rust
const COUNTER: Symbol = Symbol::short("COUNTER");
```

### Contract Data Access

The `Env` `data()` function is used to retrieve access and update a counter. The executing contract is the only contract that can query or modify contract data that it has stored. The data stored is viewable on ledger anywhere the ledger is viewable, but contracts executing within the Soroban environment are restricted to their own data.

The `get()` function gets the current value associated with the counter key.

```rust
let mut count: u32 = env
    .storage()
    .get(COUNTER)
    .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
    .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.
```

If no value is currently stored, the value given to `unwrap_or(...)` is returned instead.

Values stored as contract data and retrieved are transmitted from the environment and expanded into the type specified. In this case a `u32`. If the value can be expanded the type returned will be an `Ok(u32)`, otherwise the type returned will be an `Err(_)`. The final `unwrap()` in the above code snippet is assuming the value will always be a `u32`. If a developer caused it to be some other type a panic would occur at the unwrap.

The `set()` function stores the new count value against the key, replacing the existing value.

```rust
env.storage().set(COUNTER, count);
```

## Tests

Open the `increment/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="increment/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 2);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 3);
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the `#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is `IncrementContract`, and the client is named `IncrementContractClient`.

```rust
let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:

```rust
assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
```

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the WASM using it.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    increment
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```
1
```

Rerun the invoke with the `--footprint` option to view the [footprint] of the invocation, which is the ledger entries that the contract will have read or written to.

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_increment_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --footprint \
    -- \
    increment
```

```
Footprint: {"readOnly":[{"contractData":{"contractId":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],"key":{"static":"ledgerKeyContractCode"}}}],"readWrite":[{"contractData":{"contractId":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],"key":{"symbol":[67,79,85,78,84,69,82]}}}]}
```

:::info

Soroban is a pre-release and at this time outputs footprints in an unstable JSON format.

[footprint]: ../learn/persisting-data.mdx#footprints-and-parallel-contention

Run it a few more times to watch the count change.

Use the `soroban` to inspect what the counter is after a few runs.

```sh
soroban contract read --id 1 --key COUNTER
```
