Now that we've built a basic Hello World example to see the rough structure of Soroban contracts, we'll write a simple contract that stores and retrieves data. This will help you see the basics of Soroban's storage system. We'll also organize the two contracts as one combined project using a Cargo Workspace, which is a common pattern for Soroban projects.

This is going to follow along with the [increment example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.9.2/increment), which has a single function that increments an internal counter and returns the value. If you want to see a working example, [try it in
GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.9.2).

This tutorial assumes that you've already completed the previous steps in Getting Started: [Setup](./setup.mdx) and [Hello World](./hello-world.mdx).

## Setting up a multi-contract project

Many Soroban projects need more than one contract. Cargo makes this easy with workspaces, though it doesn't yet give a way to initialize a new project as a workspace (see [#8365](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8365)). Let's set it up manually.

Rather than just a `hello-soroban` folder, we want a new `soroban-tutorial` folder with a `contracts` folder inside, into which we'll move the existing `hello-soroban` project. As a diff, we want this:

```diff
-hello-soroban
+soroban-tutorial/contracts/hello-soroban
```

So change into the parent directory of `hello-soroban` and:

```bash
mkdir -p soroban-tutorial/contracts
mv hello-soroban soroban-tutorial/contracts
cd soroban-tutorial
```

You're going to want some Rust and Cargo stuff in different spots. From the new project root, run:

```bash
rm contracts/hello-soroban/Cargo.lock
mv contracts/hello-soroban/target .
cp contracts/hello-soroban/Cargo.toml .
```

Note that we copied the Cargo.toml file. That's because we're going to need some of it in the root and some of it in the subdirectory.

In the root `Cargo.toml`:

- remove the `[package]`, `[lib]`, `[features]`, and `[dev_dependencies]` sections
- keep the `[release.*]` stuff
- replace the line `[dependencies]` with `[workspace.dependencies]`
- add a `[workspace]` section

In the project-specific `Cargo.toml`, keep roughly the opposite sections, and use the dependency versions as specified in the workspace root. It all ends up looking like this:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="soroban-tutorial/Cargo.toml" label="Cargo.toml">

```toml
[workspace]
resolver = "2"
members = [
  "contracts/*",
]

[workspace.dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.9.2"

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true

[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="soroban-tutorial/contracts/hello-soroban/Cargo.toml" label="contracts/hello-soroban/Cargo.toml">

```toml
[package]
name = "hello-soroban"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { workspace = true }

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { workspace = true, features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now make sure everything works:

    soroban contract build

Everything should build.

    cargo test

All tests should pass.

## Code

Rather than initializing this contract with `cargo new`, let's copy the `hello-soroban` project:

```bash
cp -r contracts/hello-soroban contracts/incrementor
```

You'll need to update the `Cargo.toml` file to reflect the correct name:

```diff title="contracts/incrementor/Cargo.toml"
 [package]
-name = "hello-soroban"
+name = "incrementor"
 version = "0.1.0"
 edition = "2021"
```

And now in `contracts/incrementor/src/lib.rs`, we'll replace the contents with the following:

```rust title="contracts/incrementor/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, log, symbol_short, Env, Symbol};

const COUNTER: Symbol = symbol_short!("COUNTER");

#[contract]
pub struct IncrementorContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementorContract {
    /// Increment an internal counter; return the new value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> u32 {
        let mut count: u32 = env.storage().instance().get(&COUNTER).unwrap_or(0);

        count += 1;

        log!(&env, "count: {}", count);

        env.storage().instance().set(&COUNTER, &count);

        env.storage().instance().bump(100);

        count
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

Make sure it builds:

    soroban contract build

Check that it built:

    ls target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm

You should see both `hello_soroban.wasm` and `incrementor.wasm`.

## How it Works

Follow along in your `contracts/incrementor/src/lib.rs` file.

### Contract Data Keys

Contract data is associated with a key. The key is the value that can be used at
a later time to lookup the value.

`Symbol` is a short (up to 32 characters long) string type with limited
character space (only `a-zA-z0-9_` characters are allowed). Identifiers like
contract function names are represented by `Symbol`s.

The `symbol_short!()` macro is a convenient way to pre-compute short symbols up to 9 characters in length at compile time using `Symbol::short`. It generates a compile-time constant that adheres to the valid character set of letters (a-zA-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (\_). If a symbol exceeds the 9-character limit, `Symbol::new` should be utilized for creating symbols at runtime.

```rust
const COUNTER: Symbol = symbol_short!("COUNTER");
```

### Contract Data Access

The `Env.storage()` function is used to access and update contract data. The executing contract is the only contract that can query or modify contract data that it has stored. The data stored is viewable on ledger anywhere the ledger is viewable, but contracts executing within the Soroban environment are restricted to their own data.

The `get()` function gets the current value associated with the counter key.

```rust
let mut count: u32 = env
    .storage()
    .instance()
    .get(&COUNTER)
    .unwrap_or(0); // If no value set, assume 0.
```

If no value is currently stored, the value given to `unwrap_or(...)` is returned instead.

Values stored as contract data and retrieved are transmitted from [the environment](../fundamentals-and-concepts/environment-concepts.mdx) and expanded into the type specified. In this case a `u32`. If the value can be expanded, the type returned will be a `u32`. Otherwise, if a developer caused it to be some other type, a panic would occur at the unwrap.

The `set()` function stores the new count value against the key, replacing the existing value.

### Managing Contract Data Lifetimes with `bump()`

All contract data has a "lifetime" that must be periodically bumped. If an
entry's lifetime is not periodically bumped, the entry will eventually reach the end of its lifetime and "expire". You can learn more about this in the [State Expiration](../fundamentals-and-concepts/state-expiration.mdx) document.

For now, it's worth knowing that there are three kinds of storage:
`Persistent`, `Temporary`, and `Instance`. This contract only uses `Instance` storage: `env.storage().instance()`. Every time the counter is incremented, this storage gets bumped by 100 [ledgers](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/ledgers), or about 500 seconds.

## Run on Sandbox

Let's invoke this contract the same way we invoked the Hello World contract. We'll use `--id 2`, since we already used `--id 1` for the Hello World contract. For Sandbox, these values are stored in a `.soroban/ledger.json` file in the current directory; you can always remove this file to reset the ledger.

    soroban contract invoke \
      --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/incrementor.wasm \
      --id 2 \
      -- \
      increment

You should see the following output:

    1

Rerun the invoke with the `--footprint` option to view the [footprint](../fundamentals-and-concepts/persisting-data.mdx#footprints-and-parallel-contention) of the invocation, which is the ledger entries that the contract will read or write to.

    soroban contract invoke \
      --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/incrementor.wasm \
      --id 2 \
      --footprint \
      -- \
      increment

You should see:

    Footprint: {"readOnly":[{"contractData":{"contractId":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],"key":{"static":"ledgerKeyContractCode"}}}],"readWrite":[{"contractData":{"contractId":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],"key":{"symbol":[67,79,85,78,84,69,82]}}}]}

:::info Footprint formats are unstable
Soroban is a pre-release and at this time outputs footprints in an unstable JSON format.
:::

Run it without the `--footprint` a few more times to watch the count change.

Use `contract read` to inspect what the full storage looks like after a few runs.

    soroban contract read --id 1 --key COUNTER

## Tests

Open the `contracts/increment/src/test.rs` file and replace the contents with:

```rust title="contracts/incrementor/src/test.rs"
use crate::{IncrementorContract, IncrementorContractClient};
use soroban_sdk::Env;

#[test]
fn increment() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementorContract);
    let client = IncrementorContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 2);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 3);
}
```

This uses the same concepts described in the Hello World example.

Make sure it passes:

    cargo test

You'll see that this runs tests for the whole workspace; both the Hello World contract and the new Incrementor.

If you want to see the output of the `log!` call, run the tests with `--nocapture`:

```
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
count: U32(0)
count: U32(1)
count: U32(2)
test test::incrementor ... ok
```

## Take it further

Can you figure out how to add `get_current_value` function to the contract? What about `decrement` or `reset` functions?

## Commit your changes

Looking at your git diff will be interesting now. It's probably kind of noisy if you just run `git status` or `git diff` right away, but once you `git add .`, git will understand the _renames_ (aka "moves") of all the old `hello-soroban` files better.

Go ahead and commit it.

```bash
git commit -m "add incrementor contract"
```

## Summary

In this section, we added a new contract to this project, reorganizing the project as a multi-contract project using Cargo Workspaces. The new contract made use of Soroban's storage capabilities to store and retrieve data. We also learned about the different kinds of storage and how to manage their lifetimes.

Next we'll learn to deploy contracts to Soroban's Futurenet network and interact with them over RPC using the CLI.
