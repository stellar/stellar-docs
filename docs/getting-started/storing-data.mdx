Now that we've worked through a basic Hello World example to see the rough structure of Soroban contracts, we'll write a simple contract that stores and retrieves data. This will help you see the basics of Soroban's storage system. We'll also organize the two contracts as one combined project using a Cargo Workspace, which is a common pattern for Soroban projects.

This is going to follow along with the [increment example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0-rc2/increment), which has a single function that increments an internal counter and returns the value. If you want to see a working example, [try it in
GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v20.0.0-rc2).

This tutorial assumes that you've already completed the previous steps in Getting Started: [Setup](./setup.mdx), [Hello World](./hello-world.mdx), and [Deploy to Testnet](./deploy-to-testnet.mdx).

## Creating an Incrementor contract

The basic structure of our new contract will be similar to the hello-soroban contract, so let's copy that directory and use that as a starting point. From the root of the `astro-soroban-tutorial` project, run:

```bash
cp -r contracts/hello-soroban contracts/incrementor
```

You'll need to update the `Cargo.toml` file to reflect the correct name:

```diff title="contracts/incrementor/Cargo.toml"
 [package]
-name = "hello-soroban"
+name = "incrementor"
 version = "0.1.0"
 edition = "2021"
```

And now in `contracts/incrementor/src/lib.rs`, we'll replace the contents with the following:

```rust title="contracts/incrementor/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, log, symbol_short, Env, Symbol};

const COUNTER: Symbol = symbol_short!("COUNTER");

#[contract]
pub struct IncrementorContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementorContract {
    /// Increment an internal counter; return the new value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> u32 {
        let mut count: u32 = env.storage().instance().get(&COUNTER).unwrap_or(0);

        count += 1;

        log!(&env, "count: {}", count);

        env.storage().instance().set(&COUNTER, &count);

        env.storage().instance().bump(100, 100);

        count
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

Make sure it builds:

    soroban contract build

Check that it built:

    ls target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm

You should see both `hello_soroban.wasm` and `incrementor.wasm`.

## How it Works

Follow along in your `contracts/incrementor/src/lib.rs` file.

### Contract Data Keys

Contract data is associated with a key. The key can be used at
a later time to look up the value.

`Symbol` is a short (up to 32 characters long) string type with limited
character space (only `a-zA-z0-9_` characters are allowed). Identifiers like
contract function names and contract data keys are represented by `Symbol`s.

The `symbol_short!()` macro is a convenient way to pre-compute short symbols up to 9 characters in length at compile time using `Symbol::short`. It generates a compile-time constant that adheres to the valid character set of letters (a-zA-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (\_). If a symbol exceeds the 9-character limit, `Symbol::new` should be utilized for creating symbols at runtime.

```rust
const COUNTER: Symbol = symbol_short!("COUNTER");
```

### Contract Data Access

The `Env.storage()` function is used to access and update contract data. The executing contract is the only contract that can query or modify contract data that it has stored. The data stored is viewable on ledger anywhere the ledger is viewable, but contracts executing within the Soroban environment are restricted to their own data.

The `get()` function gets the current value associated with the counter key.

```rust
let mut count: u32 = env
    .storage()
    .instance()
    .get(&COUNTER)
    .unwrap_or(0); // If no value set, assume 0.
```

If no value is currently stored, the value given to `unwrap_or(...)` is returned instead.

Values stored as contract data and retrieved are transmitted from [the environment](../fundamentals-and-concepts/environment-concepts.mdx) and expanded into the type specified. In this case a `u32`. If the value can be expanded, the type returned will be a `u32`. Otherwise, if a developer caused it to be some other type, a panic would occur at the unwrap.

The `set()` function stores the new count value against the key, replacing the existing value.

```rust
env.storage()
    .instance()
    .set(&COUNTER, &count);
```

### Managing Contract Data Lifetimes with `bump()`

All contract data has a "lifetime" that must be periodically bumped. If an
entry's lifetime is not periodically bumped, the entry will eventually reach the end of its lifetime and "expire". You can learn more about this in the [State Expiration](../fundamentals-and-concepts/state-expiration.mdx) document.

For now, it's worth knowing that there are three kinds of storage:
`Persistent`, `Temporary`, and `Instance`. This contract only uses `Instance` storage: `env.storage().instance()`. Every time the counter is incremented, this storage gets bumped by 100 [ledgers](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/ledgers), or about 500 seconds.

## Tests

Open the `contracts/increment/src/test.rs` file and replace the contents with:

```rust title="contracts/incrementor/src/test.rs"
use crate::{IncrementorContract, IncrementorContractClient};
use soroban_sdk::Env;

#[test]
fn increment() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementorContract);
    let client = IncrementorContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 2);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 3);
}
```

This uses the same concepts described in the Hello Soroban example.

Make sure it passes:

```bash
cargo test
```

You'll see that this runs tests for the whole workspace; both the Hello Soroban contract and the new Incrementor one.

If you want to see the output of the `log!` call, run the tests with `--nocapture`:

```
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
count: U32(0)
count: U32(1)
count: U32(2)
test test::incrementor ... ok
```

## Take it further

Can you figure out how to add `get_current_value` function to the contract? What about `decrement` or `reset` functions?

## Summary

In this section, we added a new contract to this project that made use of Soroban's storage capabilities to store and retrieve data. We also learned about the different kinds of storage and how to manage their lifetimes.

Next we'll learn a bit more about deploying contracts to Soroban's Testnet network and interact with our incrementor contract.
