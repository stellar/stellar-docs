title: 6. Soroban RPC 
description: Run an RPC Service
---

The RPC service allows you to communicate directly with the Soroban via a JSON RPC interface. 

For example, you can build an application and have it directly send a transaction, get contract and event data or simulate transactions. 

Details on all available methods are [here](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/methods).

## Run your own instance
You can download and run a local instance via [Docker Quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) and run a [standalone](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart#soroban-development) network or communicate with a live network such as [Futurenet] (and soon to come, Testnet and Mainnet).

[Futurenet]: deploy-to-futurenet.mdx 

## RPC Providers
Connect with several of our hosted instances already available for the community listed here.
