title: 6. Soroban RPC 
description: Get an RPC Service
---

The RPC service allows you to communicate directly with Soroban via a [JSON RPC interface](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/). 

For example, you can build an application and have it [send a transaction](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/methods/sendTransaction), [get ledger](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/methods/getLedgerEntry) and [event data](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/methods/getEvents) or [simulate transactions](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/methods/simulateTransaction). 

Alternatively, you can use one of Soroban's [client SDKs](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/category/sdks) such as the [js-soroban-client](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/sdks/js), which will communicate with an RPC instance.

## Run your own instance
Download and run a local instance via [Docker Quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) and run a [standalone] network or communicate with a live network such as [Futurenet] (and soon to come, Testnet and Mainnet).

[standalone]: deploy-to-a-local-network.mdx
[Futurenet]: ../reference/futurenet.mdx 

## RPC Providers
Connect to several of our [hosted instances] available for the community. 

[hosted instances]: ../references/rpc-providers.mdx
