You've built two simple contracts and run them locally in Sandbox. Now you can deploy them to a network.

Soroban has a test network called Futurenet that you can use to deploy and test your contracts. Soon Soroban will also have a test network called Testnet, which will have stronger guarantees around data persistence, but you'll still be able to use Futurenet for testing the latest Soroban features.

## Configure Futurenet in your CLI

The first step toward deploying to Futurenet is to configure your CLI to use it. You can do this by running the following command:

    soroban config network add --global futurenet \
      --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
      --network-passphrase "Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022"

Note the `--global`. This creates a file in your home folder's `/.config/soroban/network/futurenet.toml` with the settings you specified. This
means that you can use the `--network futurenet` flag in any Soroban CLI command to use this network.

If you want project-specific network configurations, you can omit the `--global` flag, and the networks will be added to your working directory's `.soroban/network` folder instead.

## Configure an Identity

So far when using Sandbox, you haven't needed to consider _who_ is sending the transactions. But when you deploy to a network, you need to specify an identity that will be used to sign the transactions.

Let's configure an identity called `alice`. You can use any name you want, but it might be nice to have some named identities that you can use for testing, such as [`alice`, `bob`, and `carol`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob).

    soroban config identity generate --global alice

You can see the public key of `alice` with:

    soroban config identity address alice

Like the Network configs, the `--global` means that the identity gets stored in `~/.config/soroban/identity/alice.toml`. You can omit the `--global` flag to store the identity in your project's `.soroban/identity` folder instead.

All this did so far is generate a public/private keypair on your local machine. No network requests were made, and `alice` has no funds on Futurenet. This means that you can't make any transactions with `alice` yet.

To get `alice` some Futurenet tokens, you'll need to use [Friendbot](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/testnet-and-pubnet#friendbot). All Stellar and Soroban test networks have a Friendbot that you can use to get some test tokens. The public Friendbot instance for Futurenet lives at `friendbot-futurenet.stellar.org`. Use it:

     curl "https://friendbot-futurenet.stellar.org/?addr=$(soroban config identity address alice)"

:::tip Command Expansion `$(…)`
This uses [command expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html), which only works with bash-compatible shells. If you are using Windows or some other shell, you will need to copy the output of `soroban config…` and paste it into the `curl` command, or figure out how command expansion works in your shell.

## Deploy

Now you can deploy your Hello World contract:

    soroban contract deploy \
      --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_soroban.wasm \
      --source alice \
      --network futurenet

This returns the ID of the contract, starting with a `C`. Let's put it somewhere semi-permanent so we can use it later. Copy that value and:

```bash
echo "C…" > .soroban/hello-id
```

You may need to create the `.soroban` folder first with `mkdir .soroban`.

## Interact

This should look a lot like interacting with the contract in the Sandbox, as you did in [1. Hello World](./hello-world.mdx). Only now the contract lives on the Futurenet network, and the CLI is making [RPC](../reference/rpc.mdx) calls in the background. Let's try it:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $(cat .soroban/hello-id) \
  --source alice \
  --network futurenet \
  -- \
  --help
```

This again makes use of command expansion `$(…)`; see the note about that above.

This looks a lot like interacting with the contract back in [1. Hello World](./hello-world.mdx), but rather than using a `--wasm` flag to point to a local wasm file, you now specify the `--network` and the `--source`. That's it! You can try calling `hello` as before:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $(cat .soroban/hello-id) \
  --source alice \
  --network futurenet \
  -- \
  hello \
  --to RPC
```

## Two-step deployment

It's worth knowing that `deploy` is actually a two-step process.

1. Upload the contract bytes to the network. Soroban currently refers to this as _installing_ the contract—from the perspective of the blockchain itself, this is a reasonable metaphor. This uploads the bytes of the contract to the network, indexing it by its hash. This contract code can now be referenced by multiple contracts, which means they would have the exact same _behavior_ but separate storage state.

2. Instantiate the contract. This actually creates what you probably think of as a Smart Contract. It makes a new contract ID, and associates it with the contract bytes that were uploaded in the previous step.

You can run these two steps separately. Let's try it with the Incrementor contract:

```bash
soroban contract install \
  --network futurenet \
  --source alice \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/incrementor.wasm
```

This returns the hash of the Wasm bytes. Now you can use `--wasm-hash` with `deploy` rather than `--wasm`. Let's also automatically pipe the returned contract ID into a file in the `.soroban` directory, so that when you search your command history and reuse the deploy command in the future, you don't forget that step (you might want to go back and do something similar with the Hello World deploy, too):

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash [paste the output from the last command] \
  --source alice \
  --network futurenet \
  > .soroban/incrementor-id
```

You can check that it saved the contract ID correctly:

```bash
cat .soroban/incrementor-id
```

Now you can interact with it over RPC like you did with the Hello World contract:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $(cat .soroban/incrementor-id) \
  --source alice \
  --network futurenet \
  -- \
  increment
```

## Run your own network/node

Sometimes you'll need to run your own node:

- Production apps! It's a bad idea to rely on the public, Stellar-maintained Soroban RPC endpoint. Instead, you should run your own node, and point your app at that.
- When you need a network that differs from the version deployed to Futurenet.

The Soroban team maintains Docker containers that makes this as straightforward as possible. See the [RPC](../reference/rpc.mdx) reference for details.

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to:

- configure networks and identities using Soroban CLI
- fund accounts on test networks using Friendbot
- deploy contracts to a test network
- interact with deployed contracts

You shouldn't have any changes to commit to git, because we didn't change any code in this lesson!

Up next, we'll use the deployed contracts to build a simple web app.
