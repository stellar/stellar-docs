Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create your
first Soroban contract.

[Setup]: setup.mdx

## Create New Project

Start by creating a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib first-project
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "first-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Add `soroban-sdk` Dependency

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`.

:::caution
The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).
:::

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
default = ["export"]
export = []
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.0.3"

[dev_dependencies]
first-project = { path = ".", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

The `features` list and `dev_dependencies` configure three variations that the
contract can be built with:
- By `default`, with `export` enabled, contract functions will be exported and
available to be invoked when the contract is deployed.
- Optionally without `export` enabled, contract functions will not be exported.
Types will be still exposed, which is useful when developing multiple contracts
together and this contract is to be imported into another but its functions are
not intended to be invoked.
- And `testutils` which will cause additional test utilities to be generated for
calling the contract in tests. The library itself is added as a `dev_dependencies`
so that whenever its tests are running the `testutils` feature is enabled.

The config for the `release` profile configures the Rust toolchain to produce
smaller contracts.

## Write the Code

Open the `src/lib.rs` file, and copy-paste the following code.

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        const GREETING: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("Hello");
        vec![&env, GREETING, to]
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::{Contract, hello};
    use soroban_sdk::{vec, Env, FixedBinary, Symbol};

    #[test]
    fn test() {
        let env = Env::default();
        let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
        env.register_contract(&contract_id, Contract);

        let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("Dev"));
        assert_eq!(
            words,
            vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("Dev"),]
        );
    }
}
```

## Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.

## Build WASM

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm
```

## Run the WASM

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
WASM using it.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```

[`soroban-cli`]: setup#install-the-soroban-cli
