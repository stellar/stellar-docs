Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create your
first Soroban contract.

[Setup]: setup.mdx

## Create New Project

Start by creating a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib first-project
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "first-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Add `soroban-sdk` Dependency

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`.

:::caution
The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).
:::

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.0.4"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.0.4", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

The `features` list includes a `testutils` feature, which will cause additional
test utilities to be generated for calling the contract in tests.

:::info
The `testutils` test utilities are automatically enabled inside [Rust unit
tests] inside the same crate as your contract. If you write [Rust integration
tests], or write tests from another crate, you'll need to add `#[cfg(feature =
"testutils")]` to those tests and enable the `testutils` feature when running
your tests with `cargo test --features testutils` to be able to use those test
utilities.
:::

The config for the `release` profile configures the Rust toolchain to produce
smaller contracts.

## Write the Code

Open the `src/lib.rs` file, and copy-paste the following code.

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), to]
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::{Contract, ContractClient};
    use soroban_sdk::{symbol, vec, BytesN, Env};

    #[test]
    fn test() {
        let env = Env::default();
        let contract_id = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
        env.register_contract(&contract_id, Contract);
        let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

        let words = client.hello(&symbol!("Dev"));
        assert_eq!(
            words,
            vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), symbol!("Dev"),]
        );
    }
}
```

## Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm
```

:::info
Hyphens in Rust crate names are replaced by underscores in code and generated file names, so `first-project` is outputted as `first_project.wasm`.
:::

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
contract.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

You should see the following output:

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```
