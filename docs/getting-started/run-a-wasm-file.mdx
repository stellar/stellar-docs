title: Run a WASM File
---

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in a
WASM file.

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract](write-a-contract.mdx) and the the
resulting `.wasm` file we built in [Build a WASM File](build-a-wasm-file.mdx)
run the following command to invoke the `hello` function with a single argument
`"friend"`.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --file target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm \
    --contract-id 1
    --fn hello
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```

[`soroban-cli`]: install-soroban-cli.mdx
