Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create your first Soroban contract.

[Setup]: setup.mdx

## Create New Project

Create a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

### Configure the Library Type

Add the `crate-type` configuration, required for building contracts.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

### Import `soroban-sdk` and Features

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`, and configure a set of features explained below.

:::caution

The `soroban-sdk` is in early development. Report issues [here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/new/choose).

:::

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.6.0"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.6.0", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]
```

The `features` list includes a `testutils` feature, which will cause additional test utilities to be generated for calling the contract in tests.

:::info

The `testutils` test utilities are automatically enabled inside [Rust unit tests] inside the same crate as your contract. If you write tests from another crate, you'll need to require the `testutils` feature for those tests and enable the `testutils` feature when running your tests with `cargo test --features testutils` to be able to use those test utilities.

:::

### Configure the `release` Profile

Configuring the `release` profile to optimize the contract build is critical. Soroban contracts have a maximum size of 256KB. Rust programs, even small ones, without these configurations almost always exceed this size.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` and use the `release` profile when building.

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

### Configure the `release-with-logs` Profile

Configuring a `release-with-logs` profile can be useful for if you need to build a `.wasm` that has logs enabled for printing debug logs when using the [`soroban-cli`]. Note that this is not necessary to access debug logs in tests or to use a step-through-debugger.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` and use the `release-with-logs` profile when you need logs.

```toml
[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```

See the [logging example] for more information about how to log.

[logging example]: ../how-to-guides/logging.mdx

### Wrapping it Up

The steps below should produce a `Cargo.toml` that looks like so.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2022"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.6.0"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.6.0", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true

[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```

## Write a Contract

Once you've created a project, writing a contract involves writing Rust code in the projects `lib.rs` file.

```rust
#![no_std]
```

All contracts should begin with `#![no_std]` to ensure that the Rust standard library is not included in the build. The Rust standard library is large and not well suited to being deployed into small programs like those deployed to blockchains.

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};
```

The contract will need to import the types and macros that it needs from the `soroban-sdk` crate. Take a look at [Create a Project](#create-new-project) to see how to setup a project.

Many of the types available in typical Rust programs, such as `std::vec::Vec`, are not available, as there is no allocator and no heap memory in Soroban contracts. The `soroban-sdk` provides a variety of types like `Vec`, `Map`, `Bytes`, `BytesN`, `Symbol`, that all utilize the Soroban environment's memory and native capabilities. Primitive values like `u128`, `i128`, `u64`, `i64`, `u32`, `i32`, and `bool` can also be used. Floats and floating point math are not supported.

Contract inputs must not be references.

```rust
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

Contract functions live inside an `impl` for a struct. The `impl` block is annotated with `#[contractimpl]`. Contract functions must be given names that are no more than 10 characters long. Functions that are intended to be called externally should be marked with `pub` visibility. The first argument can be an `Env` argument to get a copy of the Soroban environment, which is necessary for most things.

Putting those pieces together a simple contract will look like this.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, Symbol::short("Hello"), to]
    }
}
```

## Testing

Writing tests for Soroban contracts involves writing Rust code using the test facilities and toolchain that you'd use for testing any Rust code.

Given a simple contract like the contract demonstrated in the Write a Contract section, a simple test will look like this.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lib.rs" label="src/lib.rs">

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, Symbol::short("Hello"), to]
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="test.rs" label="src/test.rs" default>

```rust
#![cfg(test)]

use super::{Contract, ContractClient};
use soroban_sdk::{symbol, vec, Env};

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
    let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let words = client.hello(&Symbol::short("Dev"));
    assert_eq!(
        words,
        vec![&env, Symbol::short("Hello"), Symbol::short("Dev"),]
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run inside of.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type. Contracts can specify a fixed contract ID as the first argument, or provide `None` and one will be generated.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the `#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is `Contract`, and the client is named `ContractClient`.

```rust
let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
let words = client.hello(&Symbol::short("Dev"));
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:

```rust
assert_eq!(
    words,
    vec![&env, Symbol::short("Hello"), Symbol::short("Dev"),]
);
```

### Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.

## Build

To build a Soroban contract to deploy or run, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

:::tip

Use the `release` profile outlined in [Configure the Release Profile], otherwise the contract will exceed Soroban's size limits.

:::

A `.wasm` file will be outputted in the `target` directory. The `.wasm` file is the built contract.

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm
```

The `.wasm` file contains the logic of the contract, as well as the contract's specification that can be imported into other contracts who wish to call it. This is the only artifact needed to deploy the contract, share the interface with others, or integration test against the contract.

:::tip

To further optimize builds to be as small as possible, see [Optimizing Builds].

[Configure the Release Profile]: #configure-the-release-profile
[Optimizing Builds]: #optimizing-builds

## Run on Sandbox

If you have the [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can run contracts in a local sandbox environment.

The Soroban sandbox environment is the same Soroban environment that runs on Stellar networks, but it runs without nodes, and without the other features you find on a Stellar network.

:::info

It's also possible to run a contract on a fully featured local network. See [Deploy to a Local Network] for more details.

:::

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract] and the resulting `.wasm` file we built in [Build], run the following command to invoke the `hello` function. Here we're setting the `to` argument to `friend`:

```sh
soroban contract invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/[project-name].wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    -- \
    --to friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello", "friend"]
```

:::info The `--` double-dash is required!

This is a general [CLI pattern](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11376/what-does-double-dash-mean) used by other commands like [cargo run](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html). Everything after the `--`, sometimes called [slop](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/971), is passed to a child process. In this case, `soroban contract invoke` builds an _implicit CLI_ on-the-fly for the `hello` method in your contract. It can do this because Soroban SDK embeds your contract's schema / interface types right in the `.wasm` file that gets deployed on-chain. Try this, too:

    soroban contract invoke ... --fn hello -- --help

:::

## Hello World Example

The [hello world example] demonstrates how to write a simple contract, with a single function that takes one input and returns it as an output.

[hello world example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.7.0/hello_world

## Optimizing Builds

Use `soroban contract optimize` to further minimize the size of the `.wasm`.

```sh
soroban contract optimize \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm
```

This will optimize and output a new `first_project.optimized.wasm` file in the same location as the input `.wasm`.

:::tip

Building optimized contracts is only necessary when deploying to a network with fees or when analyzing and profiling a contract to get it as small as possible. If you're just starting out writing a contract, these steps are not necessary. See [Build] for details on how to build for development.
