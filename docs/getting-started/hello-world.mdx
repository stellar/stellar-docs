Once you've [setup](./setup.mdx) your development environment, you're ready to create your first Soroban contract.

## Create New Project

Create a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib hello-soroban
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "hello-soroban"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

### Configure the Library Type

Add the `crate-type` configuration, required for building contracts.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

### Import `soroban-sdk` and Features

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` to import the `soroban-sdk`, and configure a set of features explained below.

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "20.0.0"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "20.0.0", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]
```

The `features` list includes a `testutils` feature, which will cause additional test utilities to be generated for calling the contract in tests.

:::info

The `testutils` are automatically enabled inside [Rust unit tests] inside the same crate as your contract. If you write tests from another crate, you'll need to require the `testutils` feature for those tests and enable the `testutils` feature when running your tests with `cargo test --features testutils` to be able to use those test utilities.

:::

### Configure the `release` Profile

Configuring the `release` profile to optimize the contract build is critical. Soroban contracts have a maximum size of 256KB. Rust programs, even small ones, without these configurations almost always exceed this size.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` and use the `release` profile when building.

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

### Configure the `release-with-logs` Profile

Configuring a `release-with-logs` profile can be useful if you need to build a `.wasm` file that has logs enabled for printing debug logs when using the [`soroban-cli`]. Note that this is not necessary to access debug logs in tests or to use a step-through-debugger.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` and use the `release-with-logs` profile when you need logs.

```toml
[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```

See the [logging example] for more information about how to log.

[logging example]: ../basic-tutorials/logging.mdx

### Wrapping it Up

The steps above should produce a `Cargo.toml` that looks like so.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "20.0.0"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "20.0.0", features = ["testutils"] }

[features]
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true

[profile.release-with-logs]
inherits = "release"
debug-assertions = true
```

## Write a Contract

Once you've created a project, writing a contract involves writing Rust code in the project's `lib.rs` file. You can delete the default functions that cargo added to `lib.rs`.

All contracts should begin with `#![no_std]` to ensure that the Rust standard library is not included in the build. The Rust standard library is large and not well suited to being deployed into small programs like those deployed to blockchains.

```rust
#![no_std]
```

The contract will need to import the types and macros that it needs from the `soroban-sdk` crate. Take a look at [Create a Project](#create-new-project) to see how to setup a project.

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};
```

Many of the types available in typical Rust programs, such as `std::vec::Vec`, are not available, as there is no allocator and no heap memory in Soroban contracts. The `soroban-sdk` provides a variety of types like `Vec`, `Map`, `Bytes`, `BytesN`, `Symbol`, that all utilize the Soroban environment's memory and native capabilities. Primitive values like `u128`, `i128`, `u64`, `i64`, `u32`, `i32`, and `bool` can also be used. Floats and floating point math are not supported.

Contract inputs must not be references.

The `#[contract]` attribute designates the Contract struct as the type to which contract functions are associated. This implies that the struct will have contract functions implemented for it. Contract functions are defined within an `impl` block for the struct, which is annotated with `#[contractimpl]`. It is important to note that contract functions should have names with a maximum length of 32 characters. Additionally, if a function is intended to be invoked from outside the contract, it should be marked with the `pub` visibility modifier. It is common for the first argument of a contract function to be of type `Env`, allowing access to a copy of the Soroban environment, which is typically necessary for various operations within the contract.

```rust
#[contract]
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol_short!("Hello"), to]
    }
}
```

Putting those pieces together a simple contract will look like this.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

#[contract]
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    /// Say Hello to someone or something.
    /// Returns a length-2 vector/array containing 'Hello' and then the value passed as `to`.
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol_short!("Hello"), to]
    }
}
```

## Testing

Writing tests for Soroban contracts involves writing Rust code using the test facilities and toolchain that you'd use for testing any Rust code.

You'll need to add an annotation to bottom of `lib.rs` to tell Rust to compile and run the test code.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

Given a simple contract like the contract demonstrated in the Write a Contract section, a simple test will look like this.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lib.rs" label="src/lib.rs">

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

#[contract]
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol_short!("Hello"), to]
    }
}
#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="test.rs" label="src/test.rs" default>

```rust
use crate::{Contract, ContractClient};
use soroban_sdk::{symbol_short, vec, Env};

#[test]
fn hello() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
    let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let words = client.hello(&symbol_short!("Dev"));
    assert_eq!(
        words,
        vec![&env, symbol_short!("Hello"), symbol_short!("Dev"),]
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run inside of.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type. Contracts can specify a fixed contract ID as the first argument, or provide `None` and one will be generated.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the `#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is `Contract`, and the client is named `ContractClient`.

```rust
let client = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
let words = client.hello(&symbol_short!("Dev"));
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:

```rust
assert_eq!(
    words,
    vec![&env, symbol_short!("Hello"), symbol_short!("Dev"),]
);
```

### Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.

:::note

The first time you run the tests you may see output in the terminal of cargo compiling all the dependencies before running the tests.

## Build

To build a Soroban contract to deploy or run, use the `soroban contract build` command.

```sh
soroban contract build
```

This is a small wrapper around `cargo build` that sets the target to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and the profile to `release`. You can think of it as a shortcut for the following command:

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file will be outputted in the `target` directory. The `.wasm` file is the built contract.

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_soroban.wasm
```

The `.wasm` file contains the logic of the contract, as well as the contract's [specification / interface types](../fundamentals-and-concepts/fully-typed-contracts.mdx), which can be imported into other contracts who wish to call it. This is the only artifact needed to deploy the contract, share the interface with others, or integration test against the contract.

## Optimizing Builds

Use `soroban contract optimize` to further minimize the size of the `.wasm`. First, re-install soroban-cli with the `opt` feature:

    cargo install --locked --version 20.1.1 soroban-cli --features opt

Then build an optimized `.wasm` file:

    soroban contract optimize \
      --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_soroban.wasm

This will optimize and output a new `hello_soroban.optimized.wasm` file in the same location as the input `.wasm`.

:::tip
Building optimized contracts is only necessary when deploying to a network with fees or when analyzing and profiling a contract to get it as small as possible. If you're just starting out writing a contract, these steps are not necessary. See [Build] for details on how to build for development.
:::

## Commit to version control

Before we go on to deploying the contract to Testnet in the next section, this is a great time to commit your code to version control. Even if you don't share your project with others, this will make it easier for you to see and understand your own changes throughout the rest of the tutorial.

Cargo will have already setup the `hello-soroban` directory as a git repository.

You should update the `.gitignore` file with `.soroban` directory as it will contain cached information about your local development and use of the `soroban-cli`:

```bash
echo .soroban >> .gitignore
```

Now you can make your initial commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: hello-soroban contract"
```

## Summary

In this section, we wrote a simple contract that can be deployed to a Soroban network.

Next we'll learn to deploy the hello-soroban contract to Soroban's Testnet network and interact with it over RPC using the CLI.
