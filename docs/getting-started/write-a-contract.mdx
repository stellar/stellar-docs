title: Write a Contract
---

Once you have a project setup, like how we setup a project in [First
Project](first-project.mdx), writing a contract involves writing Rust code in
the projects `lib.rs` file.

```rust
#![no_std]
```

All contracts should begin with `#![no_std]` to ensure that the Rust standard
library is not included in the build. The Rust standard library is large and not
well suited to being deployed into small programs like those deployed to
blockchains.

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};
```

The contract will need to import the types and macros that it needs from the
`soroban_sdk` crate. Take a look at [First Project](first-project.mdx) to see
how to setup a project.

Many of the types available in typical Rust programs, such as `std::vec::Vec`,
are not available, as their is no allocator and no heap memory in Soroban
contracts. The `soroban_sdk` provides a variety of types like `Vec`, `Map`, and
`BigInt`, `Binary`, `FixedBinary`, that all utilize the Host environments memory
and native capabilities.

```rust
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

Contract functions live inside a `impl` for a struct. The `impl` block is
annotated with `#[contractimpl]`, and the functions that are intended to be
called are assigned `pub` visibility and have an `Env` argument as their first
argument.

Putting those pieces together a simple contract will look like this.

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        const GREETING: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("Hello");
        vec![&env, GREETING, to]
    }
}
```
