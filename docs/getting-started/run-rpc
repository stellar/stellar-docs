title: 6. Soroban RPC 
description: Run an RPC Service
---

The RPC service allows you to communicate directly with the Soroban runtime via a JSON RPC interface. 

For example, you can build an application and have it directly send a transaction, get contract and event data or simulate transactions. 

Details on all available methods are [here](https://soroban.stellar.org/api/methods).

## Run your own instance
You can download and run a local instance via Docker and run a standalone network or set the network to Futurenet (and soon to come, Testnet and Mainnet).

## RPC Providers
Connect with several of our hosted instances already available for the community listed here.
