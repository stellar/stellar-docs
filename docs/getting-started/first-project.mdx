Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create your
first Soroban contract.

[Setup]: setup.mdx

## Create New Project

Start by creating a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "first-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Add `soroban-sdk` Dependency

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`.

:::caution
The `soroban-sdk` is still in early development. Please report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-sdk).
:::

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
default = ["export"]
export = []
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk", rev = "32b76650" }

[dev_dependencies]
first-project = { path = ".", features = ["testutils"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

The features list and dev_dependencies might look a little strange, but we've
said that our contract can be built in three variations:
- By `default` with `export` with contract functions exported and available to
be called.
- Optionally without `export` enabled, contract functions not exported but types
exposed, which is useful when developing multiple contracts together.
- And when running tests with `testutils`, so that all the utilities that get
automatically generated for tests are available in the tests of your contract
and others that import it.

The config for the `release` profile lean the Rust toolchain towards optimizing
the size of the resulting code to keep it smaller.

## Write the Code

Open the `src/lib.rs` file, and copy-paste the following code.

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        const GREETING: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("Hello");
        vec![&env, GREETING, to]
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::{Contract, hello};
    use soroban_sdk::{vec, Env, FixedBinary};

    #[test]
    fn test() {
        let env = Env::default();
        let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
        env.register_contract(&contract_id, Contract);

        let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("Dev"));
        assert_eq!(
            words,
            vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("Dev"),]
        );
    }
}
```

## Run the Tests

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run. You should see the following output:

```sh
cargo test
```

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

Try changing the values in the test to see how it works.

## Build WASM

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm
```

## Run the WASM

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
WASM using it.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --file target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first-project.wasm \
    --contract-id 1
    --fn hello
    --arg friend
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```
["Hello","friend"]
```

[`soroban-cli`]: install-soroban-cli.mdx
