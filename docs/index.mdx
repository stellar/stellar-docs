Stellar is a layer-1 open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network that provides a framework for developers to create applications, issue assets, and connect to existing financial rails. Stellar is designed to enable creators, innovators, and developers to build projects on the network that can interoperate with each other.

There are three main use cases for building on Stellar: building applications, issuing assets, and building anchors. These docs aim first to teach you Stellar fundamentals to help you build, walk you through how to set up for each use case, and then how to run your own Horizon API instance and validator node.

If you can’t find answers to your questions in the docs, search for your answer or ask questions in our [Stellar Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev) or [Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com/).

You can file a pull request to add new content, suggest revisions to existing content using the edit icon at the top of each page, or submit suggestions, requests, and bug reports as issues in the [Docs GitHub Repo](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues).
