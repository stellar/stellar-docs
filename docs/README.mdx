Soroban is a smart contracts platform designed to be sensible, built-to-scale, batteries-included, and developer-friendly.

:::info

Version 20 of the Stellar protocol has now reached stable release! This is the version that includes the Soroban smart contracts platform. Soroban can now be considered to be in a stable, finalized state.

:::

While it works well with Stellar, a blockchain that shares its values of scale and sensibility, it doesn't depend on or require Stellar at all, and can be used by any transaction processor, including other blockchains, L2s, and permissioned ledgers.

Currently, Soroban is a part of the v20 stable release of the Stellar protocol. The Soroban platform includes the smart contracts environment, a Rust SDK, A CLI, and an RPC server. Developers can write and test contracts on their local machine or deploy them to Testnet.

## What "stable release" means

We've been releasing very early versions of Soroban since the earliest days of its existence. We have moved on from having "preview releases" and "release candidates," and the current state of Soroban is now a _stable release_. New development efforts are now targeted to a future version, and the current release has been "frozen."

We still believe it's important to share the development process, and we want Stellar ecosystem developers and smart contract developers from other ecosystems to continue experimenting and we continue listening for feedback. Please keep testing it out, see what you can do, and let us know what you think. The stable release means developers can now build to last.

## How to leave feedback

Please feel free to file issues in the Soroban repos, or, if you prefer, to raise them in the `soroban` channels in the [Stellar Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/sp8zfb4qH6).

## Why it's called Soroban

The Japanese soroban is the smallest and simplest abacus. Its design is intentionally compact and minimalist, focused on doing the essentials â€” and doing them well. It set the global standard for abacuses and is still in practical use today. The name aligns with the goals of this platform because we, too, want to build something that focuses on doing the essentials well, that sets a global standard, and that proves useful far into the future.
