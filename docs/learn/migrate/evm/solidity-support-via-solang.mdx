title: Solidity support via Solang
description: Compile Solidity contracts to Wasm for Soroban using the Solang compiler.
---

Leverage the Hyperledger Solang compiler to compile Solidity contracts to Soroban.

- Learn about the Solidity SDK and links to Solang in Tools: [Contract SDKs](../../../tools/sdks/contract-sdks.mdx)
- Solang docs (Soroban target): https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targets/soroban.html
- Solang repository and examples: https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/tree/main/examples/soroban
- Solang Web IDE: https://solang.io/

Notes
- Solang is currently in experimental state, and not all Solidity features are supported.
- The Solang Soroban target is community-maintained and evolves quickly; check the docs for the latest feature support and usage.
- The easiest way to use Solang is via the Web IDE, but you can also build Solang from source or use prebuilt binaries.
- For deployment and interaction, use the Soroban CLI and client SDKs after compiling your Wasm artifact.
