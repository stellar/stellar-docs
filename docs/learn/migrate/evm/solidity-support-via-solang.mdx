title: Solidity support via Solang
description: Compile Solidity contracts to Wasm for Stellar using the Solang compiler.
---

Leverage the Hyperledger Solang compiler to compile Solidity contracts to Soroban.

- Learn about the Solidity SDK and links to Solang in Tools: [Contract SDKs](../../../tools/sdks/contract-sdks.mdx)
- Solang docs (Soroban target): https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targets/soroban.html
- Solang repository and examples: https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/tree/main/examples/soroban
- Solang Web IDE: https://solang.io/

:::caution

Solidity support via Solang for Stellar is experimental and evolving. Not all Solidity features are supported yet, and breaking changes may occur. We Don't recommend using Solang for production contracts at this time.

:::

- The easiest way to use Solang is via the Web IDE, but you can also build Solang from source or use prebuilt binaries.
- For deployment and interaction, use the Stellar CLI and client SDKs after compiling your Wasm artifact.
