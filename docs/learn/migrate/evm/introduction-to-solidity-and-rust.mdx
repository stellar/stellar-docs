# Introduction

We are excited to introduce you to Soroban, a powerful smart contracts platform designed to be sensible, built-to-scale, and developer-friendly, with a focus on Rust's performance and safety benefits. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Soroban offers an ideal platform for developers who are seeking a more efficient and effective way to build decentralized applications and transition from Solidity to Rust. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of Solidity, Rust, and Soroban, and guide you through setting up the development environment to start your journey with Soroban's Rust smart contract compatibility.

## Solidity and Dapp Development

Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language primarily used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It enables the creation of decentralized applications (dapps) that can run on various blockchain platforms, automating complex transactions and interactions without the need for a central authority.

## Rust: Performance and Safety

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, concurrency, and performance. Its unique features, such as a strong static type system, ownership model, and memory safety guarantees, make it an ideal choice for developing high-performance, secure applications, including smart contracts.

## Soroban: Programmable Logic

Soroban, a sensible and built-to-scale smart contracts platform, offers a developer-friendly and batteries-included experience. While it shares the same principles of scalability and practicality as Stellar, Soroban can also function as a standalone platform and integrate with other transaction processors, such as L2s, permissioned ledgers, and even other blockchains. With Soroban, Classic Stellar gains the added functionality of programmable logic in the form of custom operations encapsulated within smart contracts.

You can learn more about Soroban's features and benefits in the [Soroban Overview](../../../smart-contracts).

## Setting Up the Development Environment for Rust and Soroban

To get started with Rust and Soroban, follow the steps on the [Setup Page](../../../smart-contracts/getting-started/setup.mdx).

# Summary

As you embark on your journey with Soroban, remember that the platform is designed to provide a seamless, efficient, and enjoyable experience for developers transitioning from Solidity to Rust. By leveraging Rust's performance and safety benefits, alongside Soroban's advanced tooling, you'll be well-equipped to develop high-quality, efficient, and secure smart contracts.
