# List of Operations

Operations are objects that represent a desired change to the ledger and are submitted to the network grouped in a transaction. For each operation, there is a successful or failed result type. In the case of success, the user can gather information about the effect of the operation. In the case of failure, the user can learn more about the error.

Learn more about transactions and operations in our [Operations and Transactions section](./operations-and-transactions.mdx).

There are currently 26 operations you can use on the Stellar network, these operations, their definitions, SDKs, thresholds, parameters, and errors are listed below.

:::note

All these operations have an optional source account parameter. If the source account parameter is omitted, the source account of the transaction is considered as the source account of the operation.

## Create account

Creates and funds a new account with the specified starting balance

**SDKs**: [JavaScript](http://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/Operation.html#.createAccount) | [Java](https://github.com/lightsail-network/java-stellar-sdk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/stellar/sdk/operations/CreateAccountOperation.java) | [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/txnbuild#CreateAccount)  
**Threshold**: Medium

**Parameters**:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Destination | account ID | New account address that is created and funded. |
| Starting Balance | integer | Amount of XLM to send to the newly created account. This XLM comes from the source account. |

**Possible errors**:

| Error | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATE_ACCOUNT_MALFORMED` | -1 | The `destination` is invalid. |
| `CREATE_ACCOUNT_UNDERFUNDED` | -2 | The source account performing the command does not have enough funds to give `destination` the `starting balance` amount of XLM and still maintain its minimum XLM reserve plus satisfy its XLM selling liabilities. |
| `CREATE_ACCOUNT_LOW_RESERVE` | -3 | This operation would create an account with fewer than the minimum number of XLM an account must hold. |
| `CREATE_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXIST` | -4 | The `destination` account already exists. |

## Payment

For details about the flags, please refer to the [Asset Design Considerations page](../../../tokens/control-asset-access.mdx). The bit mask integer subtracts from the existing flags of the account. This allows for setting specific bits without knowledge of existing flags. |
| Set flags | integer | Indicates which [account](../stellar-data-structures/accounts.mdx) flags to set. These account-level flags are primarily used by asset issuers. For details about the flags, please refer to the [Asset Design Considerations page](../../../tokens/control-asset-access.mdx#controlling-access-to-an-asset-with-flags) The bit mask integer adds onto the existing flags of the account. This allows for setting specific bits without knowledge of existing flags. |
| Master weight | integer | A number from 0-255 (inclusive) representing the weight of the master key. If the weight of the master key is updated to 0, it is effectively disabled. |
| Low threshold | integer | A number from 0-255 (inclusive) representing the threshold this account sets on all operations it performs that have [a low threshold](../../fundamentals/transactions/signatures-multisig.mdx). |

| High threshold | integer | A number from 0-255 (inclusive) representing the threshold this account sets on all operations it performs that have [a high threshold](../../fundamentals/transactions/signatures-multisig.mdx). |
| Home domain | string | Sets the home domain of an account. See [Federation](../../glossary.mdx#federation). |
| Signer | \{Public Key, weight} | Add, update, or remove a signer from an account. Signer weight is a number from 0-255 (inclusive). The signer is deleted if the weight is 0. |

| Error | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SET_OPTIONS_LOW_RESERVE` | -1 | This account does not have enough XLM to satisfy the minimum XLM reserve increase caused by adding a subentry and still satisfy its XLM selling liabilities. For every new signer added to an account, the minimum reserve of XLM that account must hold increases. |
| `SET_OPTIONS_TOO_MANY_SIGNERS` | -2 | 20 is the maximum number of signers an account can have, and adding another signer would exceed that. |
| `SET_OPTIONS_BAD_FLAGS` | -3 | The flags set and/or cleared are invalid by themselves or in combination. |
| `SET_OPTIONS_INVALID_INFLATION` | -4 | The destination account set in the `inflation` field does not exist. |

**Threshold**: Medium  
**Result**: `ChangeTrustResult`  
**Parameters**:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Line | ChangeTrustAsset | The asset of the trustline. For example, if a user extends a trustline of up to 200 USD to an anchor, the `line` is USD:anchor. |

## Allow trust

Updates the authorized flag of an existing trustline. This operation can only be performed by the asset issuer

:::warning

This operation is deprecated as of Protocol 17- prefer [_SetTrustlineFlags_](#set-trustline-flags) operation instead.

:::

**SDKs**: [JavaScript](http://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/Operation.html#.allowTrust) | [Java](https://github.com/lightsail-network/java-stellar-sdk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/stellar/sdk/operations/AllowTrustOperation.java) | [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/txnbuild#AllowTrust)  
**Threshold**: Low  
**Result**: `AllowTrustResult`  
**Parameters**:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trustor | account ID | The account that has an established trustline for the asset. |
| Type | asset code | The 4 or 12 character-maximum asset code of the trustline the source account is authorizing. For example, if an issuing account wants to allow another account to hold its USD credit, the `type` is `USD`. |
| Authorize | integer | Flag indicating whether the trustline is authorized. `1` if the account is authorized to transact with the asset. `2` if the account is authorized to maintain offers, but not to perform other transactions |

**Possible errors**:

| Error | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALLOW_TRUST_MALFORMED` | -1 | The asset specified in `type` is invalid. In addition, this error happens when the native asset is specified. |
| `ALLOW_TRUST_NO_TRUST_LINE` | -2 | The `trustor` does not have a trustline with the issuer performing this operation. |
| `ALLOW_TRUST_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED` | -3 | The source account (issuer performing this operation) does not require trust. In other words, it does not have the flag `AUTH_REQUIRED_FLAG` set. |
| `ALLOW_TRUST_CANT_REVOKE` | -4 | The source account is trying to revoke the trustline of the `trustor`, but it cannot do so. |
| `ALLOW_TRUST_SELF_NOT_ALLOWED` | -5 | The source account attempted to allow a trustline for itself, which is not allowed because an account cannot create a trustline with itself. |
| `ALLOW_TRUST_LOW_RESERVE` | -6 | Claimable balances can't be created on revocation of asset (or pool share) trustlines associated with a liquidity pool due to low reserves. |

## Account merge

Allows issuing account to configure authorization and trustline flags to an asset

The Asset parameter is of the `TrustLineAsset` type. If you are modifying a trustline to a regular asset (i.e. one in a Code:Issuer format), this is equivalent to the Asset type. If you are modifying a trustline to a pool share, however, this is composed of the liquidity pool's unique ID.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_MALFORMED` | -1 | This can happen for a number of reasons: the asset specified by AssetCode and AssetIssuer is invalid; the asset issuer isn't the source account; the Trustor is the source account; the native asset is specified; or the flags being set/cleared conflict or are otherwise invalid. |

## Liquidity pool deposit

Deposits assets into a liquidity pool, increasing the reserves of a liquidity pool in exchange for pool shares

Parameters to this operation depend on the ordering of assets in the liquidity pool: “A” refers to the first asset in the liquidity pool, and “B” refers to the second asset in the liquidity pool.

If the pool is empty, then this operation deposits maxAmountA of A and maxAmountB of B into the pool. If the pool is not empty, then this operation deposits at most maxAmountA of A and maxAmountB of B into the pool. The actual amounts deposited are determined using the current reserves of the pool. You can use these parameters to control a percentage of slippage.
