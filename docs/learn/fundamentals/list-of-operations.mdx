Operations are objects that represent a desired change to the ledger and are submitted to the network grouped in a transaction. For each operation, there is a successful or failed result type. In the case of success, the user can gather information about the effect of the operation. In the case of failure, the user can learn more about the error.

Learn more about transactions and operations in our [Operations and Transactions section](./stellar-data-structures/operations-and-transactions.mdx).

There are currently 26 operations you can use on the Stellar network, these operations, their definitions, SDKs, thresholds, parameters, and errors are listed below.

| Clear flags | integer | Indicates which flags to clear. For details about the flags, please refer to the [Accounts section](./stellar-data-structures/accounts.mdx). The bit mask integer subtracts from the existing flags of the account. This allows for setting specific bits without knowledge of existing flags. |
| Set flags | integer | Indicates which flags to set. For details about the flags, please refer to the [Accounts section](./stellar-data-structures/accounts.mdx). The bit mask integer adds onto the existing flags of the account. This allows for setting specific bits without knowledge of existing flags. |
| Master weight | integer | A number from 0-255 (inclusive) representing the weight of the master key. If the weight of the master key is updated to 0, it is effectively disabled. |

| Error | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SET_OPTIONS_LOW_RESERVE | -1 | This account does not have enough XLM to satisfy the minimum XLM reserve increase caused by adding a subentry and still satisfy its XLM selling liabilities. For every new signer added to an account, the minimum reserve of XLM that account must hold increases. |
| SET_OPTIONS_TOO_MANY_SIGNERS | -2 | 20 is the maximum number of signers an account can have, and adding another signer would exceed that. |
| SET_OPTIONS_BAD_FLAGS | -3 | The flags set and/or cleared are invalid by themselves or in combination. |

**Threshold**: Medium  
**Result**: `ChangeTrustResult`  
**Parameters**:

| Parameters | Type | Description |

**Threshold**: Low  
**Result**: `AllowTrustResult`  
**Parameters**:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trustor | account ID | The account of the recipient of the trustline. |
| Type | asset code | The 4 or 12 character-maximum asset code of the trustline the source account is authorizing. For example, if an issuing account wants to allow another account to hold its USD credit, the `type` is `USD`. |
| Authorize | integer | Flag indicating whether the trustline is authorized. `1` if the account is authorized to transact with the asset. `2` if the account is authorized to maintain offers, but not to perform other transactions |

**Possible errors**:

| Error | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ALLOW_TRUST_MALFORMED | -1 | The asset specified in `type` is invalid. In addition, this error happens when the native asset is specified. |
| ALLOW_TRUST_NO_TRUST_LINE | -2 | The `trustor` does not have a trustline with the issuer performing this operation. |
| ALLOW_TRUST_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED | -3 | The source account (issuer performing this operation) does not require trust. In other words, it does not have the flag `AUTH_REQUIRED_FLAG` set. |
| ALLOW_TRUST_CANT_REVOKE | -4 | The source account is trying to revoke the trustline of the `trustor`, but it cannot do so. |
| ALLOW_TRUST_SELF_NOT_ALLOWED | -5 | The source account attempted to allow a trustline for itself, which is not allowed because an account cannot create a trustline with itself. |
| ALLOW_TRUST_LOW_RESERVE | -6 | Claimable balances can't be created on revocation of asset (or pool share) trustlines associated with a liquidity pool due to low reserves. |

## Set trustline flags

Allows issuing account to configure authorization and trustline flags to an asset

The Asset parameter is of the `TrustLineAsset` type. If you are modifying a trustline to a regular asset (i.e. one in a Code:Issuer format), this is equivalent to the Asset type. If you are modifying a trustline to a pool share, however, this is composed of the liquidity pool's unique ID.

Learn more about flags: [Flags Glossary Entry](../glossary.mdx/#flags)

**Threshold**: Low  
**Result**: `SetTrustLineFlagsResult`  
**Parameters**:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trustor | account ID | The account that established this trustline. |
| Asset | TrustLineAsset | The asset trustline whose flags are being modified. |
| SetFlags | integer | One or more flags (combined via bitwise-OR) indicating which flags to set. Possible flags are: 1 if the trustor is authorized to transact with the asset or 2 if the trustor is authorized to maintain offers but not to perform other transactions. |
| ClearFlags | integer | One or more flags (combined via bitwise OR) indicating which flags to clear. Possibilities include those for SetFlags as well as 4, which prevents the issuer from clawing back its asset (both from accounts and claimable balances). |

| SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS_LOW_RESERVE | -5 | Claimable balances can't be created on revocation of asset (or pool share) trustlines associated with a liquidity pool due to low reserves. |

## Liquidity pool deposit

Deposits assets into a liquidity pool, increasing the reserves of a liquidity pool in exchange for pool shares

Parameters to this operation depend on the ordering of assets in the liquidity pool: “A” refers to the first asset in the liquidity pool, and “B” refers to the second asset in the liquidity pool.

If the pool is empty, then this operation deposits maxAmountA of A and maxAmountB of B into the pool. If the pool is not empty, then this operation deposits at most maxAmountA of A and maxAmountB of B into the pool. The actual amounts deposited are determined using the current reserves of the pool. You can use these parameters to control a percentage of slippage.
