Soroban contracts are as much as possible regular Rust programs and can be debugged using the same tools you'd usually use.

The debugging facilities available differ significantly depending on whether a contract is compiled natively for local testing, or compiled into Wasm for deployment.

Deciding between these two modes and making the most of them while debugging requires a **careful understanding** of which code is compiled-in to deployed contracts and which code is only available for local testing.

## Local-testing mode

It is possible (and encouraged during development) to compile Soroban contracts **natively** (eg. as x86-64 or AArch64 code) and link against the host environment **directly**, such that the contract is not a guest running in a Wasm virtual machine at all: it is simply one native library calling another -- its host -- and both host and contract are linked together as a single program, together with a test harness.

This configuration is referred to as **"local-testing mode"** and since it eliminates the Wasm virtual machine from the debugging experience it has many advantages:

- Tests run much faster since there is no VM interpreting them, and will execute in parallel by default on multiple threads.
- Tests can use numerous standard testing and debugging techniques:
  - [The standard Rust `#[test]` harness](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/testing.html), including push-button IDE support for running and re-running single tests.
  - [Standard IDE-supported debuggers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust#_debugging), including IDE support for setting breakpoints and inspecting values in both contract and host.
  - Lightweight debugging via [standard logging](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) or [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/).
  - Systematic testing such as [fuzzing](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-fuzz), [property-testing](https://crates.io/crates/proptest), or even [model checking](https://crates.io/crates/kani-verifier) or [formal verification](https://github.com/xldenis/creusot).
  - The simplest of all debugging approaches, [printing to standard error](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.eprintln.html).

Local-testing mode is the **default** configuration when compiling code targeting your local computer's CPU and operating system, which is what cargo will do if you set up a new Rust project and don't specify a target.

## Wasm mode

If on the other hand you wish to compile for deployment, you must tell cargo to build for the Wasm target.

Building for Wasm will _disable_ many of the debugging facilities described above, typically for one of three reasons:

- The Wasm VM simply can't (or the VM we've chosen doesn't) provide them.
- The Wasm VM _could_ provide them but doing so would violate constraints of the [contract Rust dialect](../contract-development/rust-dialect.mdx).
- The Wasm VM _could_ provide them but doing so would make the resulting Wasm code impractically large.

While we encourage most testing to happen in local-testing mode, some problems will obviously only arise in deployment and some debugging facilities thus remain available even there:

- A "sandbox" host with a mock-ledger that can read and write `CONTRACT_DATA` ledger entries to the local filesystem.
- A general logging system that allows contracts to log values of the [shared host/guest "value" type](../contract-development/environment-concepts.mdx), even in production.
- User-extensible `Error` codes that can be returned from any contract call to indicate problems.
