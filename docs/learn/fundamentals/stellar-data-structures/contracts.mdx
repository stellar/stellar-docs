A smart contract is a programmed set of executable code and state that can be invoked on the Stellar network. Smart contracts store data and also define rules for how that data can be used. Stellar has integrated a smart contracts platform called "Soroban" into the core protocol. These contracts are programs written in the Rust language and compiled as WebAssembly (Wasm) for deployment.

Learn about Stellar smart contract concepts such as storage, authorization, debugging, and more in the [Smart Contract Learn Section](../contract-development/overview.mdx).

Write your first Stellar smart contract by following the [Getting Started Guide](../../../build/smart-contracts/getting-started/README.mdx).
