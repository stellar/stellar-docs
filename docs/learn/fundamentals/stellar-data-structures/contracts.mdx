Soroban is the smart contracts platform on the Stellar network. These contracts are small programs written in the Rust language and compiled as WebAssembly (Wasm) for deployment.

Learn about Stellar smart contract concepts such as storage, authorization, debugging, and more in the [Smart Contract Learn Section](../contract-development/overview.mdx).

Write your first Stellar smart contract by following the [Getting Started Guide](../../../build/smart-contracts/getting-started/README.mdx).
