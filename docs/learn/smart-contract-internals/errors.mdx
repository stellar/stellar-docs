There are a number of ways to generate errors in contracts.

One way is error enum types, that are defined by contracts and that map errors to unsigned 32-bit integer values. They are usable as error values in the return types of contract functions.

:::info

The [errors example] demonstrates how to define your own error types.

## Error Enums

Errors are a special type of enum integer type that are stored on ledger as `Status` values containing a `u32` code.

```rust
#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum Error {
    AnError = 1,
}
```

When converted to XDR, the value becomes an `ScVal`, containing a `ScStatus`, containing the integer value of the error as contract error.

```json
{ "status": { "contractError": 1 } }
```
