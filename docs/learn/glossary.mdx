### Account

A central Stellar data structure to hold balances, sign transactions, and issue assets.

See the [Accounts section](./fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts.mdx) to learn more.

### Account ID

The public key used to create an account. This key persists across different key assignments.

### Anchor

The on and off-ramps on the Stellar network that facilitate one-to-one conversion of off-chain representations to and from tokenized assets, for example, digital tokens representing bank deposits.

Read more in the [Anchor Encyclopedia entry](./encyclopedia/anchors.mdx)

### Application (app)

A software program designed for users to carry out a specific task (other than operating the computer itself).

### Asset

Fiat, physical, or other tokens of value that are tracked, held, or transferred by the Stellar distributed network.

See the [Assets section](./fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/assets.mdx) to learn more.

### Balance

The amount of a given asset an account holds. Each asset has its own balance and these balances are stored in trustlines for every asset except XLM, which is held directly by the account.

### BalanceID

Parameter required when claiming a newly created entry via the Claim claimable balance operation. See [ClaimableBalanceID](#claimablebalanceid).

### Base fee

The fee you’re willing to pay per operation in a transaction.

This differs from the Effective Base Fee which is the actual fee paid per operation for a transaction to make it to the ledger. When the network is in surge pricing mode, the effective base fee varies based on an auction mechanism. When it's not, the effective base fee defaults to the network minimum currently at 100 stroops per operation.

Learn more in our [Fees section](./fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering.mdx).

### Base reserve

A unit of measurement used to calculate an account’s minimum balance. One base reserve is currently 0.5 XLM.

Learn more in our [Lumens section](./fundamentals/lumens.mdx#base-reserves).

### Burn

Remove an asset from circulation, which can happen in two ways: 1) a holder sends the asset back to the issuing account 2) an issuer claws back a clawback-enabled asset from a holder's account.

### Claim Predicate

A recursive data structure used to construct complex conditionals with different values of ClaimPredicateType.

### ClaimableBalanceID

A SHA-256 hash of the OperationID for claimable balances.

### Claimant

An object that holds both the destination account that can claim the ClaimableBalanceEntry and a ClaimPredicate that must evaluate to true for the claim to succeed.

### Clawback

An amount of asset from a trustline or claimable balance removed (clawed back) from a recipient’s balance sheet.

See the [Clawback](./encyclopedia/clawbacks.mdx) Encyclopedia Entry for more information.

### Core Advancement Proposals (CAPs)

Proposals of standards to improve the Stellar protocol- CAPs deal with changes to the core protocol of the Stellar network.

### Create account operation

Makes a payment to a 0-balance public key (Stellar address), thereby creating the account. You must use this operation to initialize an account rather than a standard payment operation.

### Cross-asset payments

A payment that automatically handles the conversion of dissimilar assets.

### Decentralized exchange

A distributed exchange that allows the trading and conversion of assets on the network.

Learn more in our [Liquidity on Stellar](./encyclopedia/liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools.mdx#sdex) Encyclopedia Entry.

See the [Operation and Transaction Validity section](./fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/operations-and-transactions.mdx#preconditions) for more information.

### Price

The ratio of the quote asset and the base asset in an order.

### Public key

The public part of a keypair that identifies a Stellar account. The public key is public- it is visible on the ledger, anyone can look it up, and it is used when sending payments to the account, identifying the issuer of an asset, and verifying that a transaction is authorized.

### Mainnet or Pubnet

The Stellar Public Network, aka mainnet, the main network used by applications in production.

Read more in our [Networks section](./fundamentals/networks.mdx).

### Rate-limiting

Horizon rate limits on a per-IP-address basis. By default, a client is limited to 3,600 requests per hour, or one request per second on average.

### Sequence number

Used to identify and verify the order of transactions with the source account.

A transaction’s sequence number must always increase by one (unless minimum sequence number preconditions are set, or a bump sequence operation is used). SDKs and the Laboratory automatically increment the account’s sequence number by one when you build a transaction.

### Secret (private) key

The private key is part of a keypair, which is associated with an account. Do not share your secret key with anyone.

### SEPs (Stellar Ecosystem Proposals)

Standards and protocols to allow the Stellar ecosystem to interoperate.

### Stellar

A decentralized, federated peer-to-peer network that allows people to send payments in any asset anywhere in the world instantaneously, and with minimal fees.

### Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)

Provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a closed system to accurately record financial transactions.

See our [SCP section](./fundamentals/stellar-consensus-protocol.mdx) to learn more.

### Stellar Core

A replicated state machine that maintains a local copy of a cryptographic ledger and processes transactions against it, in consensus with a set of peers; also, the reference implementation for the peer-to-peer agent that manages the Stellar network.

### Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)

A non-profit organization founded to support the development and growth of the Stellar network.

### Stellar.toml

The Stellar Test Network is maintained by the Stellar Development Foundation, which developers can use to test applications. Testnet is free to use and provides the same functionality as the main (public) network.

Read more in our [Networks](./fundamentals/networks.mdx).

### Threshold

The level of access for an operation.

Also used to describe the ratio of validator nodes in a quorum set that must agree in order to reach consensus as part of the Stellar Consensus Protocol.

Read more about operation thresholds in the [Operations and Transactions section](./fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/operations-and-transactions.mdx#operations).

Learn more about quorum set validators in our [Stellar Consensus Protocol section](./fundamentals/stellar-consensus-protocol.mdx).

### Time bounds

An optional feature you can apply to a transaction to enforce a time limit on the transaction; either the transaction makes it to the ledger or times out (fails) depending on your time parameters.

Read more about time bounds in our [Operation and Transaction Validity section](./fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/operations-and-transactions.mdx#transaction-and-operation-validity).

### Transaction

A group of 1 to 100 operations that modify the ledger state.

### Transaction fee

Stellar requires a small fee for all transactions to prevent ledger spam and prioritize transactions during surge pricing.

Learn more in our [Lumens section](./fundamentals/lumens.mdx#transaction-fees).

### Trustline

An explicit opt-in for an account to hold a particular asset that tracks liabilities, the balance of the asset, and can also limit the amount of an asset that an account can hold.

Learn more in our [Accounts section](./fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts.mdx#trustlines).

### TTL (Time To Live)

A smart contract's TTL is how many ledgers remain until the data entry is no longer live.

### Type

The classification of data that dictates the kind of data that can be stored and how it can be manipulated within a smart contract.

### UNIX timestamp

An integer representing a given date and time, as used on UNIX and Linux computers.

### Validator

A basic validator keeps track of the ledger and submits transactions for possible inclusion. It ensures reliable access to the network and sign-off on transactions. A full validator performs the functions of a basic validator, but also publishes a history archive containing snapshots of the ledger, including all network transactions and their results.

### XLM (lumens)

The native currency of the Stellar network.

### Wallet

An interface that gives a user access to an account stored on the ledger; that access is controlled by the account’s secret key. The wallet allows users to store and manage their assets.
