description: Associate information with an account.

You can manage data associated with [accounts](../../fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/accounts.mdx) using the [`ManageData` operation](../../fundamentals/transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#manage-data). The data entry uses up one account subentry, increasing base reserves. In exchange for this slight cost, you can retrieve an account with [user-defined](../../../data/apis/horizon/api-reference/resources/operations/object/manage-data.mdx) key-value pairs.

Existing community projects use this field for [IPFS direction](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/), verification attestations, and much more. The information shows up towards the end of a Horizon response for a base account URL:

```curl

  "ipns": "azUxcXppNXVxdTVka2l0MjdnYzc4a2RmcWpneGxxaW9mdnBtOXFiY2NrZGtzbzVodHUxcWVjYnl5azQwY3o=",
  "your": "value"
},
"num_sponsoring": ...
```
