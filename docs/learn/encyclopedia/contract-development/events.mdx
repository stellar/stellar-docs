Events are the mechanism that applications off-chain can use to monitor changes and events in contracts on-chain.

## How are events emitted?

`ContractEvents` are emitted in Stellar Core's `TransactionMeta`. You can see in the [TransactionMetaV3] XDR below that there is a list of `OperationEvents` called `events`. Each `OperationEvent` corresponds to an operation in a transaction, and itself contains a list of `ContractEvents`. Note that `events` will only be populated if the transaction succeeds.

[transactionmetav3]: #transactionmetav3

### ContractEvent

An event's topics don't have to be made of the same type: you can mix different types.

An event also contains a data object of any value or type, including [custom types](./types/custom-types.mdx) defined by contracts using `#[contracttype]`:

```cpp
struct ContractEvent
{
    // We can use this to add more fields, or because it
    // is first, to change ContractEvent into a union.
    ExtensionPoint ext;

    Hash* contractID;
    ContractEventType type;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        struct
        {
            SCVec topics;
            SCVal data;
        } v0;
    }
    body;
};
```

### OperationEvents

```cpp
struct OperationEvents
{
    ContractEvent events<>;
};
```

### TransactionMetaV3

```cpp
struct TransactionMetaV3
{
    LedgerEntryChanges txChangesBefore; // tx level changes before operations
                                        // are applied if any
    OperationMeta operations<>;         // meta for each operation
    LedgerEntryChanges txChangesAfter;  // tx level changes after operations are
                                        // applied if any
    OperationEvents events<>;           // custom events populated by the
                                        // contracts themselves. One list per operation.
    TransactionResult txResult;

    Hash hashes[3];                     // stores sha256(txChangesBefore, operations, txChangesAfter),
                                        // sha256(events), and sha256(txResult)

    // Diagnostics events that are not hashed. One list per operation.
    // This will contain all contract and diagnostic events. Even ones
    // that were emitted in a failed contract call.
    OperationDiagnosticEvents diagnosticEvents<>;
};
```

### Event types

There are three `ContractEventType`'s -

1. `CONTRACT` events are events emitted by contracts that use the `contract_event` host function to convey state changes.
2. `SYSTEM` events are events emitted by the host. At the moment, there's only one system event emitted by the host. It is emitted when the `update_current_contract_wasm` host function is called, where `topics = ["executable_update", old_executable: ContractExecutable, old_executable: ContractExecutable]` and `data = []`.
3. `DIAGNOSTIC` events are meant for debugging and will not be emitted unless the host instance explictly enables it. You can read more about this below.

## What are diagnosticEvents?

While looking at the `TransactionMetaV3` XDR struct above, you may have noticed the `diagnosticEvents` field. This list will be empty by default unless your stellar-core instance has `ENABLE_SOROBAN_DIAGNOSTIC_EVENTS=true` in its config file. If diagnostic events are enabled, this list will not only include all ContractEvents in `events`, but will also include events from failed contract calls, errors from the host, events to trace the contract call stack, and logs from the `log_from_linear_memory` host function. These events can be identified by `type == DIAGNOSTIC`. The diagnostic events emitted by the host to track the call stack are defined below.

### fn_call

The `fn_call` diagnostic event is emitted when a contract is called and contains -

- Topics
  1.  The symbol "fn_call".
  2.  The contract id of the contract about to be called.
  3.  A symbol containing the name of the function being called.
- Data
  1. A vector of the arguments passed to the function being called.

### fn_return

The `fn_return` diagnostic event is emitted when a contract call completes and contains -

- Topics
  1.  The symbol "fn_return".
  2.  A symbol containing the name of the function that is about to return.
- Data
  1. The value returned by the contract function.

### When should diagnostic events be enabled?

`events` contain `ContractEvents` that should convey information about state changes. `diagnosticEvents` on the other hand contain events that are not useful for most users, but may be helpful in debugging issues or building the contract call stack. Because they won't be used by most users, they can be optionally enabled because they are not hashed into the ledger, and therefore are not part of the protocol. This is done so a stellar-core node can stay in sync with the network while emitting these events that normally would not be useful for most users.

Due to the fact that a node with diagnostic events enabled will be executing code paths that diverge from a regular node, we highly encourage only using this feature on watcher node (nodes where `NODE_IS_VALIDATOR=false` is set).

## Reading events

You can use the [`getEvents`](../../../data/rpc/api-reference/methods/getEvents.mdx) endpoint of any RPC service to fetch and filter events by type, contract, and topic.

:::warning

Events are ephemeral: RPC providers typically only keep short chunks (less than a week) of history around.

To learn more about working with events, take a look at the [events guides](../../../build/guides/events/README.mdx) and [this example contract](../../../build/smart-contracts/example-contracts/events.mdx).

For a quick high-level demonstration, though, we'll use the [TypeScript SDK](../../../tools/sdks/README.mdx) to infinitely fetch all `transfer` events (defined by the [Soroban Token Interface](https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-41#interface)) involving the [XLM contract](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC) and display them in a human-friendly format.

<CodeExample>

```javascript
import {
  humanizeEvents,
  nativeToScVal,
  scValToNative,
  Address,
  Networks,
  Asset,
  xdr,
} from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { Server } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/rpc";

const s = new Server("https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org");

async function main() {
  const response = await s.getLatestLedger();
  const xlmFilter = {
    type: "contract",
    contractIds: [Asset.native().contractId(Networks.TESTNET)],
    topics: [
      // Defined in https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-41#interface
      // for all compatible transfer events.
      [
        nativeToScVal("transfer", { type: "symbol" }).toXDR("base64"),
        "*", // from anyone
        "*", // to anyone
        "*", // any asset (it'll be XLM anyway)
      ],
    ],
  };
  let page = await s.getEvents({
    startLedger: response.sequence - 120, // start ~10m in the past
    filters: [xlmFilter],
    limit: 10,
  });

  // Run forever until Ctrl+C'd by user
  while (true) {
    if (!page.events.length) {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 2000));
    } else {
      //
      // Two ways to output a human-friendly version:
      //  1. the RPC response itself for human-readable text
      //  2. a helper for the XDR structured-equivalent for human-readable JSON
      //
      console.log(cereal(simpleEventLog(page.events)));
      console.log(cereal(fullEventLog(page.events)));
    }

    // Fetch the next page until events are exhausted, then wait.
    page = await s.getEvents({
      filters: [xlmFilter],
      cursor: page.cursor,
      limit: 10,
    });
  }
}

function simpleEventLog(events) {
  return events.map((event) => {
    return {
      topics: event.topic.map((t) => scValToNative(t)),
      value: scValToNative(event.value),
    };
  });
}

function fullEventLog(events) {
  return humanizeEvents(
    events.map((event) => {
      // rebuild the decomposed response into its original XDR structure
      return new xdr.ContractEvent({
        contractId: event.contractId.address().toBuffer(),
        type: xdr.ContractEventType.contract(), // since we filtered on 'contract'
        body: new xdr.ContractEventBody(
          0,
          new xdr.ContractEventV0({
            topics: event.topic,
            data: event.value,
          }),
        ),
      });
    }),
  );
}

// A custom JSONification method to handle bigints.
function cereal(data) {
  return JSON.stringify(
    data,
    (k, v) => (typeof v === "bigint" ? v.toString() : v),
    2,
  );
}

main().catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

</CodeExample>

You can also leverage RPC's alternate [XDR encoding formats](../../../data/rpc/api-reference/structure/data-format) like JSON to see human-readable events from the command-line directly, for example by passing `xdrFormat: "json"` as an additional parameter to the `getEvents` [example](../../../data/rpc/api-reference/methods/getEvents#examples).
