In this guide, we'll help you set up your local workstation with a complete end-to-end development environment using pre-defined docker-compose files, the Stellar demo wallet, and USDC on Stellar's test network. We'll be updating this guide soon to demonstrate how to create your own compose files using the docker images for each service, once they are publicly available.

Note that while we'll be using USDC and the [Demo Wallet][demo-wallet] in this guide, other Stellar assets and wallets can be used in development or production.

## Create and Fund a Distribution Account

You'll need a minimum of two accounts when using the Stellar Disbursement Platform, a distribution and receiver account. We'll create the distribution account now and will create the receiver account while making our first disbursment.

1. Go to the [Stellar Demo Wallet][demo-wallet] and select "Generate keypair for new account"
1. Select the "Create account" button next to the public key to fund your account with XLM
1. Select the "Select from preset assets" button, and select USDC
1. Finally, select "Add trustline" to enable payments of USDC

Now that we have an account that can send & receive USDC, lets fund it with enough USDC for our first disbursement. We'll use the Circle Sandbox in this guide, but you can fund your distribution account from any liquidity source of Stellar USDC.

1. Create a [Circle Sandbox][circle-sandbox] account
1. Once you're at the dashboard, Select "Get API Key", and copy it to your clipboard
1. Go to the [Circle Sample App][circle-sample-app] and enter your API key after selecting the settings icon in the top right corner
1. Select "Charge Flow", then "Prefill Form", and select a card to use (it doesn't matter which)
1. Enter the amount you'd like to purchase, then select "Make Payment"

This will fund your Circle Sandbox Account with USDC. You can repeat the process above when you run out or the test network resets, which happens quarterly.

Your USDC should appear in your account within a few minutes, which you can check using the [balances endpoint](https://sample-sandbox.circle.com/debug/payments/balances/fetch). Once funded, you can send it to your distribution account created earlier.

1. Select the icon in the top left, then "Payouts API", and finally "POST /transfers"
1. Select "Get Master Wallet ID" to load the wallet funded with USDC
1. Enter the amount you'd like to send
1. Select the "blockchain" destination type and then "XLM"
1. Paste the public key of the account you created with the demo wallet earlier
1. Select "Make API Call"

Circle will submit payment of USDC to the Stellar test network and you should receive funds in your demo wallet account almost immediately!

## Run the SDP Locally

First you'll need to clone the project.

<CodeExample>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend.git
```

</CodeExample>

Before we run the SDP, lets replace the private key configured for the distribution account with the one we created with the demo wallet earlier.

<CodeExample>

```bash
cd stellar-disbursement-platform-backend/dev
```

</CodeExample>

Copy the secret key from the demo wallet, and replace the following value in `docker-compose-tss.yml`

<CodeExample>

```yaml
DISTRIBUTION_SEED: # your secret key
```

</CodeExample>

Copy the public key from the demo wallet, and replace the following value in `docker-compose-sdp-anchor.yml`

<CodeExample>

```yaml
DISTRIBUTION_PUBLIC_KEY: # your public key
```

</CodeExample>

Then build it using the pre-defined docker compose files.

<CodeExample>

```bash
make all
```

</CodeExample>

You should now have the Stellar Disbursement Platform running locally on port 3000. However, you won't be able to log in until you create a user.

## Create an Organization Owner

We need to create an organization owner account with privileges (or role) to use the SDP. We will use the SDP CLI to add the user. Connect to the sdp-api container and create an owner account.

<CodeExample>

```bash
docker exec -it sdp-api bash
./stellar-disbursement-platform auth add-user owner@stellar.org john doe --password --owner --roles owner
```

</CodeExample>

The command will ask you to define a password and then create the user.

## Log In

Now that you have created an owner account, navigate to the dashboard by opening a browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and login with the account you just created.

![Login](/assets/SDP/SDP4.png)

Click the Sign in button and the SDP Dashboard will open. You will have no disbursements data at this point.

## Create Your First Disbursement

Create your first disbursement by clicking the New Disbursement button. Use Demo Wallet as your wallet and USDC as your asset. You can choose whatever values you like for Country and Name. Then upload your disbursement file with receiver information. You can download the template and update the values within it.

- `phone`: E164-formatted phone number of the receiver
- `id`: a unique identifier for the receiver, ensuring the receiver is only listed once per file
- `amount`: the amount to send
- `verification`: the data to verify. Currently built to verify date of birth.

Review and confirm the disbursement.

## Verify Your Identity

When a disbursement is created, the SDP attempts to send SMS messages to receivers using either Twilio or AWS SNS. This message includes a link to the wallet application selected when creating the disbursement, and should direct the receiver to install the wallet app, go through the wallet's onboarding flow, and finally register with the SDP. However, neither service is configured by default, so the SDP will not send an SMS message to the phone numbers listed in the CSV uploaded in the previous step. You can still see the message in the `sdp-api` container logs.

Check out the [Email and SMS Messages](#email-and-sms-messages) section to learn how to configure messaging in the SDP. When you do, and another disbursement is created, you should get a message like the following.

![Verify Identity](/assets/SDP/SDP8.png)

## Create a Receiver Account

Clicking on the link within the SMS message will bring you back to the Stellar Demo Wallet, where you'll need to create another account to receive the USDC. Follow the same process described earlier to create the account and add a USDC trustline.

## Initiate SEP-24 Webflow

Now we'll need to connect the demo wallet to the SDP instance running locally. To do that, select the pencil icon next to "centre.io" below your USDC balance and enter "localhost:8080".

In the "Select Action" dropdown, select "SEP-24 Deposit" to initiate a SEP-24 webflow, which triggers the User Registration process to link the new wallet to the phone number in the SDP.

![SEP-24](/assets/SDP/SDP13.png)

A SEP-24 interactive window will appear. This simulates the wallet application popup you would see on your mobile phone. Enter the phone number from the disbursement CSV.

![Webflow](/assets/SDP/SDP14.png)

Next, enter the passcode and birthday that you used in the payment file. Note: use 000000 for this example (or 999999 if you want to see an error response).

![Passcode and Birthday](/assets/SDP/SDP15.png)

The webflow provides a message indicating your successful registration, which is the trigger for the SDP to send the payment. You should receive your payment from the SDP shortly.

![Message](/assets/SDP/SDP16.png)

## Check Your Balance

Refresh your account. The Demo Wallet should now show a balance of 2 USDC sent from the SDP (or however much was defined in the CSV file).

![Success](/assets/SDP/SDP17.png)

Keep an eye on the dashboard until the payment status reaches Success. If everything was set up correctly, your money should be disbursed successfully.

## Next Up: Updating Application Secrets

Now that you've been able to make a disbursement, lets go back to our docker compose files and update some values. **This is an important step before going to production. We'll be updating encryption keys and application secrets.**

### Email and SMS Messages

The Stellar Disbursement Platform sends SMS messages and emails to receivers and users, respectively. For SMS messages, the Stellar Disbursemnet Platform supports Twilio or AWS SNS. For emails, it supports AWS SES.

You'll need to chose if you want to use Twilio or AWS SNS for SMS messages. Once you create your AWS and potentially your Twilio account, you can configure the following values with your credentials.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# Or AWS_EMAIL
MESSAGE_SENDER_TYPE: TWILIO_SMS
# AWS
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
AWS_REGION:
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
AWS_SES_SENDER_ID:
# Twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN:
TWILIO_SERVICE_SID:
```

</CodeExample>

### Authentication

Wallets authenticate with the Stellar Disbursement Platform using a mutual authentication protocol, where both the SDP and wallet prove they are in possession of their Stellar accounts by signing a payload exchanged between themselves. Once this process is complete, a JWT is provided to the wallet to use in future requests. Additionally, the SDP's microservices uses authentication tokens to communicate between themselves, and to encrypt user passwords. We need to provide updated values for all these use cases.

In `docker-compose-sdp-anchor.yml`, update the following:

<CodeExample>

```yaml
# the public key of the account used for authentication
# it should be the same public key for both attributes
SEP10_ACCOUNT:
SEP10_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY:
# the private key of the account used for authentication
# it should be the same secret key for both attributes
SEP10_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY:
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED:
# the encryption key (any secret string) for the authentication token shared with wallets
# it should be the same key for both attributes
SEP24_JWT_SECRET:
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET:
# the encryption key for the authentication token used for internal services
# These could be different or the same value
ANCHOR_PLATFORM_OUTGOING_JWT_SECRET:
SECRET_SEP24_INTERACTIVE_URL_JWT_SECRET:
SECRET_SEP24_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET:
# used to encrypt passwords of the SDP users
# NOTE: you'll need to recreate any existing users in the database if this is reset
EC256_PRIVATE_KEY:
```

</CodeExample>

There are many other configuration values to update when moving to a production environment, such as database credentials, URLs, and more.
