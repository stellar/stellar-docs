## Current Inclusion Fees

For the past three hours, inclusion fee statistics for smart contract transactions on the Mainnet network are:

## Resource Limits

:::note

Resource limitations and fees only apply to smart contract transactions. Read more about the inner workings of fees on Stellar in the [Fees section](../learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering.mdx).

## Resource Fees

| Network Setting                                | Cost (stroops)            |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| 10,000 instructions                            | 25 (250,000/max tx)       |
| Read 1 ledger entry                            | 6,250 (250,000/max tx)    |
| Write 1 ledger entry                           | 10,000 (250,000/max tx)   |
| Read 1KB from ledger                           | 1,786 (250,000/max tx)    |
| 1KB of transaction size (bandwidth)            | 1,624 (113,642/max tx)    |
| 1KB of transaction size (history)              | 16,235 (1,136,418/max tx) |
| 1KB of Events/return value                     | 10,000 (80,000/max tx)    |
| Write 1KB to ledger                            | ~11,800 (826'000/max tx)  |
| 30 days of rent for 1 KB of persistent storage | 0.29 XLM                  |
| 30 days of rent for 1 KB of temporary storage  | 0.145 XLM                 |

Note that the write fee normally fluctuates a bit (within 100 stroops/KB). However, if the ledger grows too quickly, the write fee will grow in a linear fashion with a steep slope.

The ledger rent cost ('Write 1KB' entries in the table) is based on the write fee, rent period and some coefficient.
