## Resource Limits

:::note

Resource limitations and fees only apply to smart contract transactions. Read more about the inner workings of fees on Stellar in the [Fees section](../learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering.mdx).

### Per-transaction limits

These define the maximum amount of work a single Smart contract transaction can do.

| Network Setting                                       | Value              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Max CPU instructions                                  | 100 million        |
| Max memory (RAM)                                      | 40 MB              |
| Max number of keys in the footprint                   | 100                |
| Disk reads\*                                          | 100 entries/200 KB |
| Disk writes                                           | 50 entries/132 KB  |
| Transaction size                                      | 132 KB             |
| Events+return value size bytes                        | 16 KB              |
| Individual ledger key size (contract storage key)     | 250 bytes          |
| Individual ledger entry size (including Wasm entries) | 128 KiB            |

\* Most transactions don't perform any disk reads, as only archived entries and 'classic' entries (G-accounts, trustlines) are considered to be disk reads. Live smart contract state is in-memory and is not counted towards this limit.

### TTL extension parameters

These define TTL extension parameters.

| Network Setting                  | Value    |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Persistent entry TTL on creation | 120 days |
| Temporary entry TTL on creation  | 1 day    |
| Max ledger entry TTL extension   | 6 months |

### Ledger-wide limits

These define the maximum amount of work done by all the transactions in a single ledger (single block).

| Network Setting                     | Value              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Max CPU instructions                | 600 million        |
| Max memory (RAM)                    | no explicit limit  |
| Max number of keys in the footprint | no explicit limit  |
| Disk reads                          | 1000 entries/7 MB  |
| Disk writes                         | 500 entries/143 KB |
| Transactions size                   | 133 KB             |
| Events+return value size bytes      | no explicit limit  |

## Resource Fees

| Network Setting                                | Cost (stroops)            |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| 10,000 CPU instructions                        | 25 (250,000/max tx)       |
| Read 1 ledger entry from disk                  | 6,250 (625,000/max tx)    |
| Read 1KB from disk                             | 1,786 (357,200/max tx)    |
| Write 1 ledger entry                           | 10,000 (500,000/max tx)   |
| Write 1KB to disk                              | 3,500 (462'000/max tx)    |
| 1KB of transaction size (bandwidth)            | 1,624 (214,368/max tx)    |
| 1KB of transaction size (history)              | 16,235 (2,143,020/max tx) |
| 1KB of Events/return value                     | 10,000 (160,000/max tx)   |
| 30 days of rent for 1 KB of persistent storage | ~427,000                  |
| 30 days of rent for 1 KB of temporary storage  | ~213,500                  |

Note, that the rent fees provided here may go up in case if a lot of contract data is written to the ledger within a short time period. This happens because the rent fees are designed in such a way that the closer the state size to some validator-defined threshold, the more expensive it gets to write new data or extend the TTLs.
