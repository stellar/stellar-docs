Stellar Core can be controlled using a robust CLI.

<Alert>

We will cover a selection of the _essential_ commands and syntax here, but the **very best resource** for utilizing the `stellar-core` command line is located in the [stellar-core GitHub repo].

Additionally, while the commands on this page are _CLI_ commands, there is an additional set of [_HTTP_ endpoint commands] that provide further administrative control over a running core node.

</Alert>

## Get `--help` Anywhere

The `--help` (aliases: `-h` or `-?`) option can be specified at _any place_ in the command line. It will show you the help message for the relevant command. Some example useage is as follows:

```bash
stellar-core --help
stellar-core run --help
stellar-core --help new-db
stellar-core catchup --help
```

## Essential Commands

For all stellar-core commands, options can _only_ by placed after the command.

### `new-db`

The **`new-db`** command creates or restores the local database to the genesis ledger.

#### `new-db` Options

- `--minimal-for-in-memory-mode`: Reset the special database used only for in-memory mode. (see the `--in-memory` flag in [`run` options](#run-options))

### `run`

The **`run`** command will run the `stellar-core` node.

#### `run` Options

- `--disable-bucket-gc`: Keeps all, even old, buckets on disk.
- `--metadata-output-stream <STREAM>`: Filename or file-descriptor number `fd:N` to stream metadata to.
- `--wait-for-consensus`: Wait to hear from the network before voting, for validating nodes only.

Certain features, such as `in-memory` mode options, have been deprecated, so they aren't listed here.

### `catchup`

The **`catchup`** command will execute a catchup from history archives without connecting to the network.

#### `catchup` Options

- `<DESTINATION_LEDGER/LEDGER_COUNT>`: (required) Destination ledger is any valid number or `current` and ledger count is any valid number or `max`.
- `--archive <ARCHIVE-NAME>`: Archive name to be used for catchup. Use `any` to select randomly.
- `--trusted-checkpoint-hashes <FILE-NAME>`: Get destination ledger hash from trusted output of `verify-checkpoints`.
- `--output-file <FILE-NAME>`: Output file.
- `--disable-bucket-gc`: Keeps all, even old, buckets on disk.
- `--extra-verification`: Verify all files from the archive for the catchup range.
- `--trusted-hash <HASH>`: Hash of the ledger to catchup to.
- `--force-untrusted-catchup`: Force unverified catchup.
- `--metadata-output-stream <STREAM>`: Filename or file-descriptor number `fd:N` to stream metadata to.
- `--force-back`: Force ledger state to a previous state, preserving older historical data.

<Alert>

To reiterate, this page covers a selection of the _essential_ commands, but we've only scratched the surface. The **very best, most comprehensive resource** for utilizing the `stellar-core` command line is located in the [stellar-core GitHub repo].
