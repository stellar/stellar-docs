## Creating Your Own Private Network

The [stellar-core GitHub repository] holds [a `testnet.md` file] which contains a short tutorial demonstrating how to configure and run a short-lived, isolated test network.

## Runtime Information: Start and Stop

Stellar-core can be started directly from the command line, or through a supervision system such as `init`, `upstart`, or `systemd`.

Stellar-core can be gracefully exited at any time by delivering `SIGINT` or pressing `CTRL-C`. It can be safely, forcibly terminated with `SIGTERM` or `SIGKILL`. The latter may leave a stale lock file in the `BUCKET_DIR_PATH`, and you may need to remove this file before stellar-core will restart. Broadly speaking, all components are designed to recover from abrupt termination.

Stellar-core can also be packaged in a container system such as Docker, so long as `BUCKET_DIR_PATH` and the database are stored on persistent volumes. For an example, see [`stellar/quickstart`].

## In-depth Architecture

The [stellar-core GitHub repository] also contains [the `architecture.md` file], which describes how stellar-core is structured internally, how it is intended to be deployed, and the collection of servers and services needed to get the full functionality and performance.
