## Starting Your Node

Once you've [set up your environment](./prerequisites.mdx), [configured your node](./configuring.mdx), set up your [quorum set](./configuring.mdx#choosing-your-quorum-set), and selected archives to `get` [history from](./environment-preparation.mdx#history-archives), you're ready to start Stellar Core.

Use a command equivalent to:

```bash
sudo systemctl start stellar-core
```

At this point, you're ready to observe your core node's activity as it joins the network.

You may want to skip ahead and review the [Logging](./logging.mdx) page to familiarize yourself with Stellar Core's output.

## Interacting With Your Instance

When your node is running, you can interact with Stellar Core via an administrative HTTP endpoint. Commands can be issued using command-line HTTP tools such as `curl`, or by running a CLI command such as

```bash
sudo -u stellar stellar-core --conf /etc/stellar/stellar-core.cfg http-command <http-command>
```

The HTTP endpoint is [not intended to be exposed to the public internet](./prerequisites.mdx#internal-system-access). It's typically accessed by administrators, or by a mid-tier application to submit transactions to the Stellar network.

Details of available _HTTP_ endpoint commands can be found in the [stellar-core-GitHub repo](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/software/commands.md#http-commands). Additionally, [the commands page](./commands.mdx) contains an overview of some of the most useful _CLI_ commands (non-HTTP commands) for managing a running core node.

## Joining the Network

Your node will go through the following phases as it joins the network, and you can query for the output below by using the info endpoint mentioned [here](./monitoring.mdx#general-node-information) :

### Establish Connection to Other Peers.

You should see `authenticated_count` increase.

```json
"peers" : {
  "authenticated_count" : 3,
  "pending_count" : 4
},
```

### Observing Consensus

Until the node sees a quorum, it will say:

```json
"state" : "Joining SCP"
```

After observing consensus, a new field `quorum` will display information about network decisions. At this point the node will switch to a "_Catching up_" state:

```json
"quorum" : {
  "qset" : {
    "ledger" : 22267866,
    "cost" : 20883268,
    "agree" : 5,
    "delayed" : 0,
    "disagree" : 0,
    "fail_at" : 3,
    "hash" : "980a24",
    "lag_ms" : 430,
    "missing" : 0,
    "phase" : "EXTERNALIZE"
  },
  "transitive" : {
    "intersection" : true,
    "last_check_ledger" : 22267866,
    "node_count" : 21
  }
},
"state" : "Catching up",
```

### Catching up

This is a phase where the node downloads data from any configured archives. This phase begins with something like:

```json
"state" : "Catching up",
"status" : [ "Catching up: Awaiting checkpoint (ETA: 35 seconds)" ]
```

And will then move through the various phases of downloading and applying state, such as:

```json
"state" : "Catching up",
"status" : [ "Catching up: downloading ledger files 20094/119803 (16%)" ]
```

You can specify how far back in time your node goes to catch up in your config file. If you set the `CATCHUP_COMPLETE` field to `true`, your node will replay the _entire history_ of the network, which can take a long time. Weeks. You can speed up the process by copying existing archives from another full validator, using [`archivist` tool](./publishing-history-archives.mdx#complete-history-archive). Note that you only need to replay the complete network history if you're setting up a Full Validator. Otherwise, you can specify a starting point for catchup using the `CATCHUP_RECENT` field. To get in sync as fast as possible, simply use configuration defaults for `CATCHUP_RECENT` and `CATCHUP_COMPLETE`. See the [complete example configuration] for more details.

:::info

The `CATCHUP_COMPLETE` and `CATCHUP_RECENT` config fields are mutually exclusive. If the `CATCHUP_COMPLETE` field is set to `true`, the `CATCHUP_RECENT` field will be ignored.

:::

### Synced

When the node is done catching up, its state will change to:

```json
"state" : "Synced!"
```
