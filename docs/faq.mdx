:::caution

Soroban's Stellar integration is under active-development and may change.

:::

### What is Soroban to Stellar? Is it a new blockchain?
Soroban is not a new blockchain. Soroban is a Smart contract platform that is integrated into the existing Stellar blockchain. It is an *additive* feature that lives alongside, and doesn't replace, the existing set of Stellar operations. 

### How do I invoke a Soroban contract on Stellar?
A Soroban contract can be invoked by submitting a transaction that contains the new operation: `InvokeContractOp`.

### Can Soroban contracts use Stellar accounts for authentication?
Yes. Stellar accounts are shared with Soroban. Smart contacts have access to Stellar account signer configuration and know the source account that directly invoked them in a transaction. Check out the Auth and Advanced Auth examples for more information.  

### Can Soroban contracts interact with Stellar Assets?
Yes. Soroban contains a built-in Stellar Asset Contract that is able to interact
with classic trustlines. Read more about this [here](built-in-contracts/stellar-asset-contract.mdx).

### Do Issuers of Stellar Assets maintain their authorization over an asset that has been sent to a non-account identifer in Soroban? (AUTH_REQUIRED, AUTH_REVOCABLE, AUTH_CLAWBACK)
Yes. Issuers retain the same level of control on Soroban as they have on Classic. This functionality is accessible through a set of admin functions (clawback, set_auth) on the built-in Stellar Asset Contract.

### Can Soroban contracts interact with any other Stellar operations?
No. Aside from the interactions with Accounts and Assets as mentioned above. This means that Soroban contracts can not interact with SDEX, AMMs, Claimable Balances or Sponsorships.  

### Does the Stellar base reserve apply to Soroban contracts?
No. Soroban has a different fee structure and ledger entries that are allocated by Soroban contracts do not add to an account's required minimal balance.

### Should I issue my token as a Stellar Asset or a custom Soroban token?
We recommend, to the extent possible, issuing tokens as Stellar assets. These
tokens will benefit from being interopable with the existing ecosystem of tools
available in the Stellar ecosystem, as well as being more performant because the
Stellar Asset Contract is built into the host.
