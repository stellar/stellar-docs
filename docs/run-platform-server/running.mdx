Once you have [established the Horizon database](./configuring.mdx#initialize-horizon-database) and have [setup the horizon runtime on host](./configuring.mdx#pre-requisites), you're ready to run Horizon.

If you chose bare metal installation, run the `stellar-horizon` binary with the [appropriate environment parameters](./configuring.mdx#parameters) set (or `stellar-horizon-cmd serve` if you [installed via the package manager](./installing.mdx#package-manager), which will automatically import your configuration from `/etc/default/stellar-horizon`).

If you chose containerized installation, you don't execute the horizon binary directly, instead the [stellar/stellar-horizon](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-horizon) image has a pre-defined entrypoint that will start running horizon at image startup time, whether that is from a deployment in Kubernetes or running the image directly with `docker run stellar/stellar-horizon`. In this mode, the horizon process will get all configuration settings from container environment variables defined in `docker run --env-variable` or from Kubernetes pod envrionment, which are set in `charts/horizon/values.yml` during [Horizon Helm Chart installation](./installing.mdx#helm-chart-installation).

Once horizon process starts it will emit logging to standard out. When run, you should see output similar to:

<CodeExample>

```
INFO[...] Starting horizon on :8000                     pid=29013
```

</CodeExample>

Note that the numbers may naturally be different for your installation. The log line above announces that Horizon is ready to serve client requests.

Next, you can confirm that Horizon is responding correctly by loading the root resource. In the example above, that URL would be http://127.0.0.1:8000/, and simply running `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/` would show you that the root resource loads correctly:

<CodeExample>

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "account": {
      "href": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/{account_id}",
      "templated": true
    },
    "accounts": {
      "href": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts{?signer,sponsor,asset,cursor,limit,order}",
      "templated": true
    }
  }
  // etc.
}
```

</CodeExample>

Refer to [Monitoring](./monitoring.mdx) for more details on horizon runtime logging and metrics available.
