To install Horizon in production or non-development environments, we recommend the following based on target infrastructure:

### Bare-Metal

- if host is debian linux, install prebuilt binaries [from repositories](#package-manager) using package manager.
- for any other hosts, download [prebuilt release binaries](#prebuilt-releases) of Stellar Horizon and Core for host target architecture and operation system or [compile from the source](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/docs/GUIDE_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md#building-horizon).

### Containerized

- Non-Orchestrated, if the target deployment environment does not include a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes, then this means you intend to run the horizon image [dockerhub.com/stellar/stellar-horizon](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-horizon) as a container directly with docker daemon on host. Choose the tag of the horizon image for specific release version and then pull the image using `docker pull stellar/stellar-horizon:<tag_version>` to get it locally onto host.
- Orchestrated, when the target envrionment has container orchestration such as Kubernetes cluster, then we recommend to use [Horizon Helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/horizon) to manage the installation and deployment life cycle of the horizon image as container(s) on the cluster.

For installation in development environments, please refer to the [Horizon README](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/README.md#try-it-out) from the source code repo for options to use in development context.

### Notes

#### Package Manager

SDF publishes new releases to its custom Ubuntu repositories. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system.md#adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system) to add the stable SDF repository to your host system and [Install package](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/installing-individual-packages.md#installing-individual-packages) outlines the various commands that these packages make available. To proceed with installation:

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stellar-horizon stellar-core
```

</CodeExample>

#### Prebuilt Releases

Refer to the list of [Horizon releases](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases) and [Core releases](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases). Copy the binaries to host PATH.

#### Verify bare metal installations

Run `stellar-horizon --help` from a terminal. If the help for Horizon is displayed, your installation was successful.

Some shells (such as [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)) cache PATH lookups. You may need to clear your cache (by using `rehash` in zsh, for example) or restart your shell before trying to run the aforementioned command.

#### Helm Chart Installation

If the deployment can be done on Kubernetes, there is a [horizon helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/horizon) available. Install the [Helm cli tool](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), if you haven't already on your workstation, minimum of version 3. Next, add the Stellar repo to the helm client's list of repos and view the list of available chart versions:

<CodeExample>

```bash
helm repo add stellar https://helm.stellar.org/charts
helm repo update stellar
helm search repo stellar/horizon --versions --devel
```

</CodeExample>

Don't install the horizon helm chart yet, it will be done after [Configuring](./configuring.mdx) is completed and in [Running](./running.mdx).

If kubernetes is not an option, the helm charts may still be good reference for showing how to configure and run the horizon docker container. Just run the helm command with `template` to display the generated kubeneretes manifests which demonstrate all the container configurations needed:

<CodeExample>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts; cd helm-charts
helm template -f charts/horizon/values.yaml charts/horizon/
```

</CodeExample>

## Next Step

After installation is complete, you are now ready to proceed to [Configuring Horizon](./configuring.mdx)!
