To install Horizon in production or non-development environments, we recommend the following based on target infrastructure:

### Bare-Metal
  - if host is debian linux, install prebuilt binaries [from repositories](#package-manager) using package manager.
  - for any other hosts, download [prebuilt release binaries](#prebuilt-releases) of Stellar Horizon and Core for host target architecture and operation system or [compile from the source](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/docs/GUIDE_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md#building-horizon).
### Containerized
  - non-Helm Chart, if the target environment for container does not support Helm chart installation, pull the prebuilt image [dockerhub.com/stellar/stellar-horizon](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-horizon) with docker daemon on host. Choose the tag of that image for specific release version and then pull with `docker pull stellar/stellar-horizon#<tag>` onto host.
  - Helm charts, when the target envrionment uses container orchestration such as Kubernetes. The [Horizon Helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/horizon) manages installation life cycle.

For installation in development environments, please refer to the [Horizon README](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/README.md#try-it-out) from the source code repo for options to use in development context.

### Notes

#### Package Manager

SDF publishes new releases to its custom Ubuntu repositories. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system.md#adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system) to add the stable SDF repository to your host system and [Install package](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/installing-individual-packages.md#installing-individual-packages) outlines the various commands that these packages make available. To proceed with installation:

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stellar-horizon stellar-core
```

</CodeExample>

#### Prebuilt Releases

Refer to the list of [Horizon releases](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases) and [Core releases](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases). Copy the binaries to host PATH.

#### Verify bare metal installations

Run `stellar-horizon --help` from a terminal. If the help for Horizon is displayed, your installation was successful.

Some shells (such as [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)) cache PATH lookups. You may need to clear your cache (by using `rehash` in zsh, for example) or restart your shell before trying to run the aforementioned command.

#### Helm Chart Installation

If the deployment can be done on Kubernetes, there is a [horizon helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/horizon) available.

<CodeExample>

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts; cd helm-charts
```

</CodeExample>

Edit the `charts/horizon/values.yml` and set the `image:horizon:tag` to a tag from the [stellar/stellar-horizon dockerhub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-horizon) for the image version you want to run. Also review the possibe [horizon configurations](./configuring.mdx) first and apply what is needed to `charts/horizon/values.yml`.

Deploy Horizon to your kubernetes cluster using Helm cli tool:

<CodeExample>

```bash
helm-charts$ helm install --namespace my-horizon-namespace-on-cluster -f charts/horizon/values.yaml myhorizon charts/horizon/
```

</CodeExample>

If kubernetes is not an option, the manifests in those charts may still be good reference for showing how to configure and run horizon as docker container. Just run the helm command with `template` to print the container config to screen:

<CodeExample>

```bash
helm-charts$ helm template -f charts/horizon/values.yaml charts/horizon/
```

</CodeExample>

## Next Step

After installation is complete, you are now ready to proceed to [Configuring Horizon](./configuring.mdx)!
