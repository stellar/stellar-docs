import {EndpointsTable} from "@site/src/components/EndpointsTable";

The Anchor Platform can be configured to notify the business of events, such as a transaction being initiated by a client or a payment being sent to one of the business' distribution accounts. 

Currently, the Anchor Platform takes a fairly unforgiving approach to event delivery, retrying a maximum of three times within three seconds before discarding the event. This will likely change in future releases, but for now, businesses should ensure that they implement a mechanism to recover from missed events. 

For example, if you're using the Anchor Platform's `--stellar-observer` to monitor incoming payments, a cron job can check how long it has been since a transaction was updated as ready to receive funds, and if a reasonable amount of time has passed without receiving funds, it can fetch the latest status of the transaction using the Anchor Platform's `GET /transactions/:id` endpoint to make sure the event was not missed, or continuing processing the transaction if it was.
