# Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is the easiest and fastest way to deploy [anchor services](/docs/learn/fundamentals/anchors) compatible with [Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs)](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem).

The Anchor Platform provides a complete set of tools and APIs for building on and off-ramp services on the Stellar network. With standardized interfaces and full implementations of key Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), it simplifies integration with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges, enabling you to focus on your core business logic rather than protocol implementation details.

The goal of the Anchor Platform is to handle all Stellar-specific functionality and requirements for running an anchor, allowing businesses to focus on the core business logic necessary to provide these services.

The Anchor Platform accomplishes this by implementing the ecosystem's standardized APIs (SEPs) for wallets, exchanges, and other applications to consume, while offering a set of backend APIs for businesses to provide information specific to them, such as transaction fees, exchange rates, and off-chain transaction statuses.

## Supported SEPs

The Anchor Platform implements the following Stellar Ecosystem Proposals:

- **[SEP-1](sep-guide/sep1/README.mdx)** — Stellar.toml file serving for service discovery
- **[SEP-6](sep-guide/sep6/README.mdx)** — Deposit and withdrawal operations
- **[SEP-10](sep-guide/sep10/README.mdx)** — Web authentication using challenge/response transactions
- **SEP-12** — Customer KYC/AML data management
- **[SEP-24](sep-guide/sep24/README.mdx)** — Interactive deposit and withdrawal flows
- **[SEP-31](sep-guide/sep31/integration.mdx)** — Cross-border payment processing (receive only)
- **SEP-38** — Price quotes and exchange rate services
- **[SEP-45](sep-guide/sep45/README.mdx)** — Web authentication using challenge/responses for contract accounts

## Key Features

- **Complete SEP implementations** — Full support for deposit, withdrawal, and payment processing workflows
- **Authentication & authorization** — SEP-10 and SEP-45 support for both traditional and smart contract accounts
- **Customer management** — SEP-12 integration for KYC/AML compliance and customer data handling
- **Transaction processing** — Comprehensive transaction lifecycle management with status tracking and webhook callbacks
- **Quote & exchange services** — SEP-38 integration for price discovery and exchange rate calculations
- **Multi-asset support** — Flexible configuration for multiple assets with various deposit and withdrawal methods
- **Smart contract support** — Native support for Stellar contract accounts (C-accounts) via SEP-45
