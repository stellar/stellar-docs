# Assets and Wallet Clients

This guide covers how to configure assets and wallet clients in the Anchor Platform.

## Assets Configuration

Assets define the tokens and currencies that your Anchor Platform supports for deposits and withdrawals. In the "Getting Started" guide, assets are configured in the `config/assets.yaml` file.

### Asset Definition

Each asset in the configuration file includes:

- **Asset code and issuer** - The Stellar asset identifier
- **Distribution account** - The Stellar account that holds the asset for distribution
- **Decimals** - The number of decimal places for the asset
- **Enabled operations** - Which SEP operations (deposit, withdrawal) are supported

### Example Asset Configuration

```yaml
assets:
  - code: USDC
    issuer: "G...USDC"
    distribution_account: "G...DIST"
    decimals: 7
    deposit:
      enabled: true
    withdrawal:
      enabled: true
```

## Wallet Clients Configuration

Wallet clients are applications that connect to your Anchor Platform to perform transactions on behalf of users. Clients are configured in the `clients.yaml` file.

### Client Definition

Each client configuration includes:

- **Client name** - A unique identifier for the client
- **Home domain** - The domain where the client's Stellar TOML is hosted
- **Signing key** - The public key used to verify client requests
- **Allowed operations** - Which SEP operations the client can perform

### Example Client Configuration

```yaml
clients:
  - name: "demo-wallet"
    home_domain: "demo-wallet.stellar.org"
    signing_key: "G...KEY"
    allowed_operations:
      - deposit
      - withdrawal
      - transaction_status
```

## Managing Assets

### Adding a New Asset

1. Edit the `assets.yaml` file
2. Add a new asset entry with the required fields
3. Ensure the distribution account has been created and funded
4. Restart the Anchor Platform services

### Disabling an Asset

To temporarily disable an asset without removing it:

```yaml
assets:
  - code: USDC
    deposit:
      enabled: false
    withdrawal:
      enabled: false
```

## Managing Wallet Clients

### Registering a New Client

1. Obtain the client's home domain and signing key
2. Edit the `clients.yaml` file
3. Add the new client configuration
4. Restart the Anchor Platform services

### Client Authentication

Clients authenticate using JWT tokens signed with their signing key. The Anchor Platform verifies these tokens to ensure requests are from authorized clients.

## Best Practices

- **Asset Management**: Regularly review and update asset configurations to reflect current market conditions and business requirements
- **Client Security**: Only register trusted wallet clients and regularly audit client access
- **Distribution Accounts**: Keep distribution accounts secure and monitor balances regularly
- **Configuration Versioning**: Track changes to asset and client configurations using version control
