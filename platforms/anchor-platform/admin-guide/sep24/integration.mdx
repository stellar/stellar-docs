One of the main points of interaction with the Anchor Platform is notifying the Anchor Platform about events related to the transaction.

In general, you'll want to provide updates for the following events:

- Your business is processing the KYC information provided by the user
- Your business is ready to receive funds from the user
- Your business has received funds from the user
- Your business has sent funds to the user
- Your business has processed a refund for the user's transaction
- Your business experienced an unexpected error

This is done by making JSON-RPC requests to the Platform API's endpoint. JSON-RPC requests allow you to update the status of the transaction. To move the transaction to a specific status, it's necessary to make a corresponding JSON-RPC request and pass data that is required by this RPC method.

The Anchor Platform JSON-RPC API is designed to notify the platform about changes in the status of the transaction. Given that, the API will be called every time a user or the anchor takes any action that progresses the transaction status in the flow.

You can find out more about transaction flow and statuses in the [SEP-24 protocol document][sep-24]

## Updating Deposit Transaction Via JSON-RPC

SEP-24 deposit flow diagram defines sequence/rules of the transaction's status transition and a set of JSON-RPC methods that should be called to change that status. You can't define the status you want to set for a specific transaction in your requests. Each JSON-RPC method defines data structures that it expects in request. If request doesn't contain a required attributes, the Anchor Platform will return and error and won't change status of the transaction.

[![sep24 deposit flow](/assets/sep24-deposit-flow-diagram.png)](/assets/sep24-deposit-flow-diagram.png)

:::tip

Statuses in <span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span> are mandatory and define the shortest way.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "#B0BF1A"}}>yellow</span> are optional and can be skipped.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "red"}}>red</span> mean the transaction is in an error status or it has expired.

:::

### Ready to Receive Funds

The first step of the deposit flow after starting the deposit itself is collecting KYC. It's usually done in the web-app, but can also be optionally provided by the wallet application, using [SEP-9]. Once the necessary KYC is collected, a `request_offchain_funds` JSON-RPC request should be made.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-offchain-funds.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_offchain_funds",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Request offchain funds",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `amount_in` is the amount the user has to sent to the business.
- `amount_out` is the amount the user will receive.
- `amount_fee` is the total amount of fees collected by the business.
- `asset` is part of the `amount_x` field and is in a SEP-38 format. In this example, it's set to USD, assuming the user made a bank transfer to the system using USD.

Information abouts amounts (in/out/fee) is required if you want to move the transaction from the `incomplete` to the `pending_user_transfer_start` status. If transaction status is changed from `pending_anchor` to `pending_user_transfer_start`, you can skip defining the amounts.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-offchain-funds.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

When the KYC process is long (for example, ID verification), it's advised to first set the transaction status to `pending_anchor` by using `notify_interactive_flow_completed` JSON-RPC request. This will indicate to the user that KYC is being processed.

:::

### Processing KYC Information

:::tip

This step is optional. Most businesses don't use it. You can skip it and go to the [next step](#funds-received).

Using this status is recommended when KYC verification may need to be performed asynchronously.

:::

You **must** specify the `amount_x` fields.

<CodeExample>

```json
// kyc-in-process.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_interactive_flow_completed",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Interactive flow completed.",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh kyc-in-process.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Funds Received

If offchain funds were received, you'll want to provide an updated transaction information.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-received.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_received",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds received",
      "funds_received_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "7...9",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `funds_received_at` is the date and time of receiving funds
- `external_transaction_id` is the ID of transaction on external network

The amount fields are optional. If skipped, the values from previous JSON-RPC requests will be taken.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-received.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Waiting For User Funds

In a real world, the transfer confirmation process may take time. In such cases, transactions should be set to a new status indicating that the confirmation of the transfer has been received but the funds themselves have not been received yet.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds sent",
      "funds_received_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "7...9"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Sending Onchain Funds

Next, send a transaction on the Stellar network to fulfill a user request. After the transaction completion, it's necessary to send the `notify_onchain_funds_sent` JSON-RPC request to notify a user that the funds were successfully sent.

<CodeExample>

```json
// onchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_onchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Onchain funds sent",
      "stellar_transaction_id": "7...9"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `stellar_transaction_id` is the transaction id on Stellar network of the transfer

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh onchain-funds-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

After this JSON-RPC request, the transaction will be transferred to the `completed` status.

### Sending Payment Via Custody Service

The Anchor Platform provides a possibility to send a payment via custody services, such as Fireblocks. To make a payment via custody service, it's necessary to make the following JSON-RPC request:

<CodeExample>

```json
// do-stellar-payment.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "do_stellar_payment",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Custody payment started"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh do-stellar-payment.json
```

</CodeExample>

After successful processing of the payment on a custody service, the Anchor Platform will automatically make the `notify_onchain_funds_sent` JSON-RPC request and the status of the transaction will be changed to `completed`.

:::caution

A user account may not be ready to receive funds. You can check that the account has established a [trustline](/docs/learn/glossary#trustline). Otherwise, you can set the status of the transaction to the `pending_trust` to indicate that the anchor is waiting for the user to establish the trustline.

If custody integration is enabled, the Anchor Platform will do this validation for you automatically.

:::

### Pending Trust

This status has to be set if a payment requires an asset trustline that wasn't configured by the user. There are two ways of how the transaction may be moved to the `pending_trust` status. The first one is processing of a payment via custody service in case it detected that the trustline isn't configured. The second one is when the business itself detects that the trustline is missing and wants to notify the user that it has to be configured. To move the transaction to the `pending_trust` status, it's necessary to make the following JSON-RPC request:

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-trust.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_trust",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Asset trustine not configured"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-trust.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

Payment via custody service periodically checks if the trustline was configured. If it was, it will automatically send a payment to a custody service and change the status of the transaction to `pending_stellar`.

:::

### Trust Set

This status has to be set if the business has detected that the trustline was or wasn't configured by user.

<CodeExample>

```json
// trust-set.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_trust_set",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Asset trustine set",
      "success": "true"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `success` flag which defines if trustline was or wasn't configured by user

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh trust-set.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

Depending on the `success` flag, the status of the transaction will be changed to `pending_stellar` if the trustline was set, or to `pending_anchor` if it wasn't.

:::

### Sending Refund Via Custody Service

There is a possibility to send funds back to the user (refund). You can refund the whole sum(full refund) or do a set of partial refunds. Also, if user sent more money than expected, you can refund a part of the sum back to the user and send the rest as onchain funds.

<CodeExample>

```json
// refund-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_refund_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Refund sent",
      "refund": {
        "id": "1c186184-09ee-486c-82a6-aa7a0ab1119c",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 10,
          "asset": "iso4217:USD"
        },
        "amount_fee": {
          "amount": 1,
          "asset": "iso4217:USD"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh refund-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

If a sum of refunds is less than `amount_in`, the status of the transaction will be set to `pending_anchor`. Only if the sum of refunds is equal to `amount_in`, the status of the transaction will be set to `refunded`.

:::

### Refund Pending

It's similar to [Refund sent](#refund-sent), but it handles a case when a refund has been submitted to external network but is not yet confirmed. The status of the transaction is set to `pending_external`. This is the status that will be set when waiting for Bitcoin or other external crypto network to complete a transaction, or when waiting for a bank transfer.

### Transaction Error

If you encounter an unrecoverable error when processing the transaction, it's required to set the transaction status to `error`. You can use the message field to describe the error details.

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-error.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_error",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Error occurred"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-error.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

If a user has made a transfer, you should do a transaction recovery, and then you can retry processing the transaction or initiate a refund.

:::

### Expired Transaction

Your business may want to expire transactions that have been abandoned by the user after some time. It's a good practice to clean up inactive transactions in the `incomplete` status. To do so, simply change the transaction status to `expired`.

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-expired.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_expired",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Transaction expired"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-expired.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

This JSON-RPC method can't be used after the user has made a transfer.

:::

### Transaction Recovery

Transaction status can be changed from `error/expired` to `pending_anchor`. After recovery, you can refund the received assets or proceed with processing of the transaction. To recover a transaction, it's necessary to make the following JSON-RPC request:

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-recovery.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_recovery",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Transaction recovered"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-recovery.json
```

</CodeExample>

## Updating Withdrawal Transaction Via JSON-RPC

This diagram defines a sequence/rules of transaction's status transition for SEP-24 withdrawal flow.

[![sep24 withdrawal flow](/assets/sep24-withdrawal-flow-diagram.png)](/assets/sep24-withdrawal-flow-diagram.png)

:::tip

Statuses in <span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span> are mandatory and define the shortest way.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "#B0BF1A"}}>yellow</span> are optional and can be skipped.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "red"}}>red</span> mean the transaction is in an error status or it has expired.

:::

Once the deposit flow is finished, implementing the withdrawal is straightforward. Some parts of the flow are similar and can be reused.

The starting point both for withdrawal and for deposit is the same.

### Ready to Receive Funds

Similar to deposit, the next step is to notify the user that the anchor is ready to receive funds. However, as your service will be receiving transactions over the Stellar network, the update will look differently.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-onchain-funds.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_onchain_funds",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Request onchain funds",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "destination_account": "GD...G",
      "memo": "12345",
      "memo_type": "id"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `memo` Value of memo to attach to the transaction
- `memo_type` Type of memo that the anchor should attach to the transaction
- `destination_account` Destination account

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-onchain-funds.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

Setting `memo`, `memo_type`, and `destination_account` is optional.

If integration with a third-party custodian is enabled, the Anchor Platform can generate `memo`, `memo_type`, and `destination_address` if a corresponding `deposit_info_generator_type` is chosen. Also, you can provide `memo` and `memo_type` to the request as shown above. Note that the memo must be unique, this is what helps to associate Stellar transactions with SEP transactions.

If your business manages the assets, the Anchor Platform can generate memos for you. When the status is changed to `pending_user_transfer_start`, the Anchor Platform sets the `memo` and `memo_type` automatically (only if it's not included in the request).

:::

:::note

The Stellar account that will be used to receive funds should be configured.

:::

### Processing KYC Information

This step is optional, and it's similar to [Processing KYC Information](#processing-kyc-information) of the deposit flow.

### Funds Received

If onchain funds were received, you need to provide amounts and change the status of the transaction to `pending_anchor`.

<CodeExample>

```json
// onchain-funds-received.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_onchain_funds_received",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Onchain funds received",
      "stellar_transaction_id": "7...9",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh onchain-funds-received.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

This method will be called automatically by the custody server if the custody integration is enabled.

:::

### Amount Updated

If onchain funds were received, but for some reason the `amount_in` differs from specified in the interactive flow (`amount_expected`), you can update `amount_out` and `amount_fee` to make them correspond to the actual `amount_in`. The status of the transaction in this case won't be changed and will be equal to `pending_anchor`.

<CodeExample>

```json
// amounts-updated.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_amounts_updated",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Amounts updated",
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh amounts-updated.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::note

Only `amount_out` and `amount_fee` can be updated using this JSON-RPC request, and you don't need to specify the assets of the amounts.

:::

### Offchain Funds Sent

To complete the transaction and change its status to `completed`, you need to make the `notify_offchain_funds_sent` JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds sent",
      "funds_sent_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Offchain Funds Available

You can move transaction status to `pending_user_transfer_complete` if offchain funds were sent, and if it's ready for the user / recipient to pick it up.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-available.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_available",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds available",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-available.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Offchain Funds Pending

Another option is to move the transaction's status to `pending_external`. This status means that the payment has been submitted to an external network, but is not yet confirmed.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-pending.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_pending",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds pending",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-pending.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Refund Sent

The refund logic works in the same way as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Refund Sent](#refund-sent) of the deposit flow.

### Sending Refund Via Custody Service

Integration with a custody service allows you to do a refund via a custody service, such as Fireblocks.

<CodeExample>

```json
// do-stellar-refund.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "do_stellar_refund",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Do stellar refund",
      "refund": {
        "amount": {
          "amount": 9,
          "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"

        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh do-stellar-refund.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::note

Similarly to the deposit flow, you can make a full refund or a set of partial refunds. The transaction will stay in `pending_anchor` status until the sum of refunds is less than `amount_in`. If the sum of refunds is equal to `amount_in`, the Anchor Platform will automatically change the status of the transaction to `refunded`.

### Transaction Error

Works in the same manner as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Transaction Error](#transaction-error) of the deposit flow.

### Expired Transaction

Works in the same manner as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Expired Transaction](#expired-transaction) of the deposit flow.

### Transaction Recovery

Works in the same manner as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Transaction Recovery](#transaction-recovery) of the deposit flow.
