## Modify a Stellar Info File

Next, let's modify the `stellar.toml` file created [earlier][sep1-ap]. Wallets need to know that SEP-6 functionality is supported by your business, and they also need to know all the currencies you support.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

TRANSFER_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep6"
WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"

# Add support for USDC
[[CURRENCIES]]
code = "USDC"
issuer = "GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
status = "test"
is_asset_anchored = false
desc = "USD Coin issued by Circle"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>

Note that you will need to create another file for your production deployment that uses the public network's passphrase, your production service URLs, your Mainnet distribution accounts and signing key, as well as the Mainnet issuing accounts of the assets your service utilizes.

## Enable Programmatic Deposits & Withdrawals

Add the following variable to your environment file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP6_ENABLED=true
```

</CodeExample>

Now you're ready to enable programmatic deposits and withdrawals using the SEP-6 API. Specify the following in your `dev.assets.yaml` file, and change the values depending on your use case. This example asset file enables support for Circle's USDC and a fiat USD to deposit from and withdraw to. The methods specified in the `deposit` and `withdraw` sections are the methods that will be exposed by the [`GET /info`][sep-6] SEP-6 endpoint under the `type` field in the case of `deposit` and `types` field in the case of `withdraw`.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
assets:
  - schema: stellar
    code: USDC
    issuer: GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
    distribution_account: GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7
    significant_decimals: 2
    sep6_enabled: true
    deposit:
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - SEPA
        - SWIFT
        - cash
    withdraw:
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - bank_account
        - cash
  - schema: iso4217
    code: USD
    significant_decimals: 2
```

</CodeExample>

The information provided for the `assets` value closely maps to the information that will be exposed to the wallet application using the [`GET /info`][sep-6] SEP-6 endpoint. The Anchor Platform also uses this information to validate requests made to your service.

## Enable the Customer KYC API

Businesses need to collect and validate KYC information on the customers they're facilitating transactions for. Clients determine what KYC information needs to be collected and send that information via a SEP-12 KYC API hosted by the Anchor Platform, but the Anchor Platform never stores personally-identifiable information (PII). Instead, it forwards requests from clients to the business server, and returns the business' responses back to the client, acting as a proxy server.

See the [Anchor Platform KYC API specification][platform-api-kyc] for details on the endpoints that must be implemented on your business' server.

To make this API available to clients, lets add the service URL to our Stellar Info File.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
KYC_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep12"
```

</CodeExample>

And enable it in our environment.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP12_ENABLED=true
```

</CodeExample>

## Enable Asset Exchanges

To enable asset exchanges using Stellar, follow the steps below to configure the relevant settings and ensure the services are properly integrated. SEP-6 facilitates deposit and withdrawal interactions, and enabling SEP-38 allows for quote-based exchange rates for these transactions.

Businesses need to provide their send-side counterparts with a [Rate][get-rates-api] API to check the exchange rates they're offering between the on-chain asset being used for settlement and the fiat asset being used to pay the recipient. If the rate is competitive, senders also need to be able to request a commitment to the rate currently being offered from business for a short period of time.

The Anchor Platform provides the [SEP-38 RFQ API][sep38] to senders for this purpose

Add Service URLs to the Stellar Info File

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ANCHOR_QUOTE_SERVER = "http://localhost:8080/sep38"
```

</CodeExample>

And enable the API in your environment configuration file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP38_ENABLED=true
```

</CodeExample>

Finally, configure assets to include the exchangeable assets in the `sep38` section.

<CodeExample>

```yaml
assets:
  - schema: stellar
    code: USDC
    issuer: GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
    distribution_account: GBLSAHONJRODSFTLOV225NZR4LHICH63RIFQTQN37L5CRTR2IMQ5UEK7
    significant_decimals: 2
    sep6_enabled: true
    deposit:
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - SEPA
        - SWIFT
        - cash
    withdraw:
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - bank_account
        - cash
    sep38_enabled: true
    sep38:
      exchangeable_assets:
        - iso4217:USD
  - schema: iso4217
    code: USD
    significant_decimals: 2
    sep38_enabled: true
    sep38:
      exchangeable_assets:
        - stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
```

</CodeExample>


## Test With the Demo Wallet

Wallets should now be able to discover, authenticate, and initiate transactions with your service! Your project and source files should now look something like this.

<CodeExample>

```
├── dev.env
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── config
│   ├── dev.assets.yaml
│   ├── dev.stellar.toml
```

</CodeExample>

Your environment should now look like the following.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
ASSETS_TYPE=file
ASSETS_VALUE=/home/dev.assets.yaml

SEP1_ENABLED=true
SEP1_TOML_TYPE=file
SEP1_TOML_VALUE=/home/dev.stellar.toml

SEP6_ENABLED=true
SEP6_MORE_INFO_URL_BASE_URL=http://example.com
SECRET_SEP6_MORE_INFO_URL_JWT_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"

SEP10_ENABLED=true
SEP10_HOME_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"

SEP12_ENABLED=true

SEP38_ENABLED=true
```

</CodeExample>

To test this out, go to the [Stellar Demo Wallet][stellar-demo-wallet].

Initiate a deposit transaction by doing the following:

- Create a new keypair
- Click the "Add Asset" button and enter
  - the code of the Stellar asset on your `stellar.toml` file
  - your home domain, `localhost:8080`
- Select the dropdown and click "SEP-6 Deposit", then click "Start"

The demo wallet should be able to find your `stellar.toml` file, authenticate using the Stellar keypair you just created, and initiate a transaction.
