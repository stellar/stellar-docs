One of the main points of interaction with the Anchor Platform is notifying the Platform about events related to transactions.

In general, you will want to provide updates for the following events.

- Your business requires the user to submit KYC information to process a transaction
- Your business updated the in/out/fee amounts for a transaction
- Your business is ready to receive funds from the user
- Your business has received funds from the user
- Your business has sent funds to the user
- Your business has a processed a refund for the user's transaction
- Your business experienced an unexpected error

This is done by making JSON-RPC requests to the Platform API's endpoint. JSON-RPC requests allow you to update the status of the transaction. To move the transaction to a specific status, it's necessary to make a corresponding JSON-RPC request and pass data that is required by the RPC method.

The Anchor Platform JSON-RPC API is designed to notify the platform about changes in the status of the transaction. Given that, the API will be called every time a user or the anchor takes any action that progresses the transaction status in the flow.

You can find out more about transaction flow and statuses in the [SEP-6 protocol document][sep-6].

## Updating Deposit (Exchange) Transaction Via JSON-RPC

SEP-6 deposit flow diagram defines sequences/rules of the transaction's status transition and a set of JSON-RPC method that should be called to change that status. You can't define the status you want to set for a specific transaction in your requests. Each JSON-RPC method defines data structures that it expects in request. If request doesn't contain a required attributes, the Anchor Platform will return and error and won't change status of the transaction.

The deposit exchange flow is the same as the deposit flow, except the amounts will not need to be recalculated when requesting offchain funds, if the user has provided a firm quote from the anchor.

[![sep6 deposit flow](/assets/sep6-deposit-flow-diagram.png)](/assets/sep6-deposit-flow-diagram.png)

:::tip

Statuses in <span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span> are mandatory and define the shortest way.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "#B0BF1A"}}>yellow</span> are optional and can be skipped.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "red"}}>red</span> mean the transaction is in an error status or it has expired.

:::

### Verifying KYC Information

Although Anchor Platform does not require a customer to have their KYC information collected before initiating a deposit, your business may want to collect this information before the customer makes a transfer. By listening to transaction created events, or by polling the [`GET /transactions`][get-transactions] endpoint, you can determine if the transaction requires KYC information to be collected. The required SEP-9 fields can be communicated to the user by making a `request_customer_info_update` JSON-RPC request and providing the required field names.

<CodeExample>

```json
// reuest-customer-info-update.json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_customer_info_update",
    "params": {
      "id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Please update your information to continue",
      "required_customer_info_message": "A government issued ID is required for deposits over $1000.",
      "required_customer_info_updates": [
        "id_type",
        "id_country_code",
        "id_issue_date",
        "id_expiration_date",
        "id_number"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `required_customer_info_message` is an optional message explaining why the user needs to update their information.
- `required_customer_info_updates` is an array of SEP-9 fields that the user must update.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-customer-info-update.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Ready to Receive Funds

After the user has submitted their KYC information, the anchor can notify the Platform that they are ready to receive funds. The anchor should use the `request_offchain_funds` RPC to provide the final amounts to the user. To do so, make the following JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-offchain-funds.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_offchain_funds",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Request offchain funds",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "instructions": {
        "organization.bank_number": {
          "value": "123456789",
          "description": "US Bank routing number"
        },
        "organization.bank_account_number": {
          "value": "123456789",
          "description": "US Bank account number"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `amount_in` is the amount the user has to send to the business.
- `amount_out` is the amount the user will receive.
- `amount_fee` is the total amount of fees collected by the business.
- `asset` is part of the `amount_x` field and is in a SEP-38 format. In this example, it's set to USD, assuming the user made a bank transfer to the system using USD.
- `instructions` is the set of SEP-9 standard fields that user should use to send funds to the business. In this example, the user should send funds to the bank account with the routing number `123456789` and account number `123456789`.

Information about amounts (in/out/fee) is required if you want to move the transaction to the `pending_user_transfer_start` status.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-offchain-funds.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::caution

For exchange deposits with a firm quote (the request is associated with a `quote_id`), no amounts should not be provided.

:::

### Funds Received

If offchain funds were received, you'll want to provide updated transaction information.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-received.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_received",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds received",
      "funds_received_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "7...9",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `funds_received_at` is the date and time of receiving funds.
- `external_transaction_id` is the ID of transaction on external network.

The amount fields are optional. If skipped, the values prior to this request will be used.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-received.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Waiting For User Funds

In the real world, the transfer confirmation process may take time. In such cases, transactions should be set to a new status indicating that the confirmation of the transfer has been received but the funds themselves have not been received yet.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds sent",
      "funds_received_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "7...9"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Sending Onchain Funds

Next, send a transaction on the Stellar network to fulfill the user deposit. After the Stellar transaction has been submitted, it's necessary to send the `notify_onchain_funds_sent` JSON-RPC request to notify a user that the funds were successfully sent.

<CodeExample>

```json
// onchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_onchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Onchain funds sent",
      "stellar_transaction_id": "7...9"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `stellar_transaction_id` is the transaction id on Stellar network of the transfer.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh onchain-funds-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

After this JSON-RPC request, the transaction will be transferred to the `completed` status.

### Sending Payment Via Custody Service

The Anchor Platform provides a possibility to send a payment via custody services, such as [Fireblocks](../custody-services/fireblocks/README.mdx). To make a payment via a custody service, make the following JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// do-stellar-payment.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "do_stellar_payment",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Custody payment started"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh do-stellar-payment.json
```

</CodeExample>

After successful processing of the payment on a custody service, the Anchor Platform will automatically make the `notify_onchain_funds_sent` JSON-RPC request and the status of the transaction will be changed to `completed`.

:::caution

A user account may not be ready to receive funds. You can check that the account has established a [trustline](/docs/learn/glossary#trustline). Otherwise, you can set the status of the transaction to the `pending_trust` to indicate that the anchor is waiting for the user to establish the trustline.

If custody integration is enabled, the Anchor Platform will do this validation for you automatically.

:::

### Pending Trust

This status has to be set if a payment requires an asset trustline that wasn't configured by the user. There are two ways of how the transaction may be moved to the `pending_trust` status. The first one is processing of a payment via custody service in case it detected that the trustline isn't configured. The second one is when the business itself detects that the trustline is missing and wants to notify the user that it has to be configured. To move the transaction to the `pending_trust` status, make the following JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-trust.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_trust",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Asset trustine not configured"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-trust.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

Payment via custody service periodically checks if the trustline was configured. If it was, it will automatically send a payment to a custody service and change the status of the transaction to `pending_stellar`.

:::

### Trust Set

This status has to be set if the business has detected that the trustline was or wasn't configured by user.

<CodeExample>

```json
// trust-set.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_trust_set",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Asset trustine set",
      "success": "true"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `success` flag which defines if trustline was or wasn't configured by user

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh trust-set.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

Depending on the `success` flag, the status of the transaction will be changed to `pending_stellar` if the trustline was set, or to `pending_anchor` if it wasn't.

:::

### Refund Sent

Sometimes, funds need to be sent back to the user (refund). You can refund the whole sum (full refund) or do a set of partial refunds back to the `source_account` using the `refund_memo` and `refund_memo_type` associated with the transaction if present. Also, if user sent more money than expected, you can refund a part of the sum back to the user and send the rest as onchain funds.

<CodeExample>

```json
// refund-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_refund_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Refund sent",
      "refund": {
        "id": "1c186184-09ee-486c-82a6-aa7a0ab1119c",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 10,
          "asset": "iso4217:USD"
        },
        "amount_fee": {
          "amount": 1,
          "asset": "iso4217:USD"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh refund-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

If a sum of refunds is less than `amount_in`, the status of the transaction will be set to `pending_anchor`. Only if the sum of refunds is equal to `amount_in`, the status of the transaction will be set to `refunded`.

:::

### Refund Pending

This is similar to [Refund Sent](#refund-sent), but it handles the case when a refund has been submitted to external network but is not yet confirmed. The status of the transaction is set to `pending_external`. This is the status that will be set when waiting for Bitcoin or other external crypto network to complete a transaction, or when waiting for a bank transfer.

### Transaction Error

If you encounter an unrecoverable error when processing the transaction, it's required to set the transaction status to `error`. You can use the message field to describe the error details.

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-error.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_error",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Error occurred"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-error.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

If a user has made a transfer, you should do a transaction recovery, and then you can retry processing the transaction or initiate a refund.

:::

### Expired Transaction

Your business may want to expire transactions that have been abandoned by the user after some time. It's good practice to clean up inactive transactions in the `incomplete` status. To do so, make the following JSON-RPC request to expire a transaction.

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-expired.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_expired",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Transaction expired"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-expired.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

This JSON-RPC method can't be used after the user has made a transfer.

:::

### Transaction Recovery

Transaction status can be changed from `error/expired` to `pending_anchor`. After recovery, you can refund the received assets or proceed with processing of the transaction. To recover a transaction, make the following JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-recovery.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_recovery",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Transaction recovered"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-recovery.json
```

</CodeExample>

## Updating Withdrawal (Exchange) Transaction Via JSON-RPC

The SEP-6 withdrawal flow diagram defines the sequence/rules of the transaction's status transition. You can't define the status you want to set for a specific transaction in your requests. Each JSON-RPC method defines data structures that it expects in request. If request doesn't contain a required attributes, the Anchor Platform will return and error and won't change status of the transaction.

The withdrawal exchange flow is the same as the withdrawal flow, except the amounts will not need to be recalculated when requesting onchain funds, if the user has provided a firm quote from the anchor.

[![sep6 withdrawal flow](/assets/sep6-withdrawal-flow-diagram.png)](/assets/sep6-withdrawal-flow-diagram.png)

:::tip

Statuses in <span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span> are mandatory and define the shortest way.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "#B0BF1A"}}>yellow</span> are optional and can be skipped.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "red"}}>red</span> mean the transaction is in an error status or it has expired.

:::

Once the withdrawal flow is finished, implementing the withdrawal is straightforward. Some parts of the flow are similar and can be reused.

The starting point both for withdrawal and for deposit is the same.

### Ready to Receive Funds

Similarly to deposit, the step after KYC has been collected is to notify the user that the anchor is ready to receive funds. However, as your service will be receiving transactions over the Stellar network, the RPC request will be different. The anchor should use the `request_onchain_funds` RPC to provide the final amounts to the user. To do so, make the following JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-onchain-funds.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_onchain_funds",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Request onchain funds",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "destination_account": "GD...G",
      "memo": "12345",
      "memo_type": "id"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `amount_in` is the amount the user has to send to the business.
- `amount_out` is the amount the user will receive.
- `amount_fee` is the total amount of fees collected by the business.
- `asset` is part of the `amount_x` field and is in a SEP-38 format. In this example, it's set to USD, assuming the user made a bank transfer to the system using USD.
- `memo` is the memo the user should use when sending their onchain funds to the anchor.
- `memo_type` is the memo type the user should use when sending their onchain funds to the anchor.
- `destination_account` is the account the user should send the funds to.

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-onchain-funds.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::caution

For exchange withdrawals with a firm quote (the request is associated with a `quote_id`), no amounts should not be provided.

:::

:::tip

Setting `memo`, `memo_type`, and `destination_account` is optional.

If integration with a third-party custodian is enabled, the Anchor Platform can generate `memo`, `memo_type`, and `destination_address` if a corresponding `deposit_info_generator_type` is chosen. Also, you can provide `memo` and `memo_type` to the request as shown above. Note that the memo must be unique, this is what helps to associate Stellar transactions with SEP transactions.

If your business manages the assets, the Anchor Platform can generate memos for you. When the status is changed to `pending_user_transfer_start`, the Anchor Platform sets the `memo` and `memo_type` automatically (only if it's not included in the request).

:::

:::note

The Stellar account that will be used to receive funds should be configured.

:::

### Funds Received

If onchain funds were received, you need to provide amounts and change the status of the transaction to `pending_anchor`.

<CodeExample>

```json
// onchain-funds-received.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_onchain_funds_received",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Onchain funds received",
      "stellar_transaction_id": "7...9",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh onchain-funds-received.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::tip

This method will be called automatically by the custody server if the custody integration is enabled.

:::

### Amount Updated

If onchain funds were received, but for some reason the `amount_in` differs from specified in the interactive flow (`amount_expected`), you can update `amount_out` and `amount_fee` to make them correspond to the actual `amount_in`. The status of the transaction in this case won't be changed and will be equal to `pending_anchor`.

<CodeExample>

```json
// amounts-updated.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_amounts_updated",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Amounts updated",
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh amounts-updated.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::note

Only `amount_out` and `amount_fee` can be updated using this JSON-RPC request, and you don't need to specify the assets of the amounts.

:::

### Offchain Funds Available

You can move transaction status to `pending_user_transfer_complete` if offchain funds were sent, and if it's ready for the user / recipient to pick it up.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-available.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_available",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds available",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-available.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Offchain Funds Pending

Another option is to move the transaction's status to `pending_external`. This status means that the payment has been submitted to an external network, but is not yet confirmed.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-pending.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_pending",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds pending",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-pending.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Offchain Funds Sent

To complete the transaction and change its status to `completed`, you need to make the `notify_offchain_funds_sent` JSON-RPC request.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds sent",
      "funds_sent_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

### Refund Sent

The refund logic works in the same way as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Refund Sent](#refund-sent) of the deposit flow.

### Sending Refund Via Custody Service

Integration with a custody service allows you to do a refund via a custody service, such as Fireblocks.

<CodeExample>

```json
// do-stellar-refund.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "do_stellar_refund",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Do stellar refund",
      "refund": {
        "amount": {
          "amount": 9,
          "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
        },
        "amount_fee": {
          "amount": 1,
          "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this, you need to run:

<CodeExample>

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh do-stellar-refund.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::note

Similarly to the deposit flow, you can make a full refund or a set of partial refunds. The transaction will stay in `pending_anchor` status until the sum of refunds is less than `amount_in`. If the sum of refunds is equal to `amount_in`, the Anchor Platform will automatically change the status of the transaction to `refunded`.

### Transaction Error

Works in the same manner as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Transaction Error](#transaction-error) of the deposit flow.

### Expired Transaction

Works in the same manner as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Expired Transaction](#expired-transaction) of the deposit flow.

### Transaction Recovery

Works in the same manner as for the deposit flow. For more details, see [Transaction Recovery](#transaction-recovery) of the deposit flow.
