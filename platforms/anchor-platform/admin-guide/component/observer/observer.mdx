Using the Payment Observer allows you to delegate this step to the Anchor Platform. To enable the Payment Observer, use the `--stellar-observer` flag in the command section of the [compose file](../../getting-started.mdx#configuration).

The Payment Observer will track all transactions sent to the distribution account. When the transaction with the expected memo is detected in the network, the status will automatically change to `pending_anchor` and event will be the emitted (if Kafka is used).

In order to update the transaction's statuses, the observer makes corresponding JSON-RPC requests to the platform. It should use the following URL.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL=http://platform-server:8085
```

</CodeExample>

:::caution

The Payment Observer won't validate the amounts. It's your responsibility to verify that the amount sent by the user is correct.

:::info

If you already have a system that monitors payments, make sure that the logic of the system matches the description below:

First, wait for the transaction to be included in the ledger (using an SDK). This transaction must have the expected memo and destination address (distribution account). Once this transaction has been detected and verified, notify the user that the funds have been received using the [notify_onchain_funds_received](#funds-received-1) JSON-RPC request.
