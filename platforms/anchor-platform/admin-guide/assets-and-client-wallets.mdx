# Assets and Wallet Clients

This guide covers how to configure assets and wallet clients in the Anchor Platform.

## Assets Configuration

Assets define the tokens and currencies that your Anchor Platform supports for deposits and withdrawals. In the "Getting Started" guide, assets are configured in the `config/assets.yaml` file by the `ap_start.sh`.

For the complete list of fields and defaults, see the [asset configuration reference](https://github.com/stellar/anchor-platform/blob/develop/core/src/main/resources/config/anchor-asset-default-values.yaml).

### Example Asset Configuration

```yaml
items:
  - id: stellar:native
    distribution_account: "G...DIST"
    significant_decimals: 7
    sep6:
      enabled: true
      deposit:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - SEPA
          - SWIFT
      withdraw:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - bank_account
          - cash
    sep24:
      enabled: true
    sep31:
      enabled: true
    sep38:
      enabled: true
      exchangeable_assets:
        - iso4217:USD
```

### Field Explanations

- **`id`** (Required) - The asset identifier in the format `SCHEMA:CODE:(ISSUER)` or `stellar:native` representing XLM, the native Stellar asset. For example, `stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5` represents Circle USD. For fiat currencies, use `iso4217:CODE` (e.g., `iso4217:USD`, `iso4217:CAD`).

- **`distribution_account`** - The Stellar account address that holds the asset for distribution. Not needed for fiat assets (`iso4217`).

- **`significant_decimals`** - The number of decimal places the asset supports.

- **`sep6`** - Enables SEP-6 and configures deposit/withdraw limits and methods per asset.

- **`sep24`** - Enables SEP-24 interactive flows and their per-asset settings.

- **`sep31`** - Enables SEP-31 cross-border payment support for the asset.

- **`sep38`** - Enables SEP-38 quotes and `exchangeable_assets` for supported currency pairs.

## Wallet Clients Configuration

Wallet clients are the wallet apps that connect to your Anchor Platform to perform transactions on behalf of users.

For the full list of client fields and defaults, see the [client configuration reference](https://github.com/stellar/anchor-platform/blob/main/platform/src/main/resources/config/anchor-client-default-values.yaml).

### Example Client Configuration

```yaml
items:
  - name: "referenceCustodial"
    type: custodial
    signing_keys:
      - GDJLB...KLTG
    callback_urls:
      sep6: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep6
      sep24: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep24
      sep31: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep31
      sep12: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep12
  - name: "reference"
    type: noncustodial
    domains:
      - wallet-server:8092
      - client.example.com
    callback_urls:
    ...
```

### Field Explanations

**Custodial Client Configuration:**

- **`name`** (Required) - A unique identifier for the client.

- **`type: custodial`** (Required) - The type of the client. Must be set to `custodial` for custodial clients.

- **`signing_keys`** (Required) - A list of Stellar public keys used for client SEP-10 authentication. The anchor uses these keys to verify that requests are coming from the authorized client.

- **`callback_urls`** (Optional) - URLs to which the service can send callbacks for different SEP types.
  - **`sep6`** - Callback URL for SEP-6 (deposit/withdrawal) transaction status updates
  - **`sep24`** - Callback URL for SEP-24 (interactive deposit/withdrawal) transaction status updates
  - **`sep31`** - Callback URL for SEP-31 (cross-border payments) transaction status updates
  - **`sep12`** - Callback URL for SEP-12 (KYC) customer information updates

**Noncustodial Client Configuration:**

- **`name`** (Required) - A unique identifier for the client, similar to custodial clients. Typically a name that clearly represents the client entity.

- **`type: noncustodial`** (Required) - The type of the client. Must be set to `noncustodial` for noncustodial clients. Noncustodial clients allow users to control their own private keys, and the wallet acts as an interface to user-controlled accounts.

- **`domains`** (Required) - A list of domains associated with the client, used to verify the client's identity.

- **`callback_urls`** (Optional) - URLs to which the service can send callbacks for different SEP types. Works the same way as for custodial clients (see above).
