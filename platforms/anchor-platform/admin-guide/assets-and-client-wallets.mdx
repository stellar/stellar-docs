# Assets and Wallet Clients

This guide covers how to configure assets and wallet clients in the Anchor Platform.

## Assets Configuration

Assets define the tokens and currencies that your Anchor Platform supports for deposits and withdrawals. In the "Getting Started" guide, assets are configured in the `config/assets.yaml` file by the `ap_start.sh`.

:::tip For the complete asset configuration reference with all available options and detailed comments, see the [full asset configuration file](https://github.com/stellar/anchor-platform/blob/develop/core/src/main/resources/config/anchor-asset-default-values.yaml). :::

### Example Asset Configuration

```yaml
items:
  - id: stellar:native
    distribution_account: "G...DIST"
    significant_decimals: 7
    sep6:
      enabled: true
      deposit:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - SEPA
          - SWIFT
      withdraw:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - bank_account
          - cash
    sep24:
      enabled: true
      ...
    sep31:
      enabled: true
    sep38:
      enabled: true
      exchangeable_assets:
        - iso4217:USD
```

For a complete working example that includes multiple asset types (native Stellar, fiat currencies) with full SEP protocol configurations, see the [full example asset configuration file](https://github.com/stellar/anchor-platform/blob/develop/quick-run/config/assets.yaml.template).

### Field Explanations

- **`id`** (Required) - The asset identifier in the format `SCHEMA:CODE:(ISSUER)` or `stellar:native` representing XLM, the native Stellar asset. For example, `stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5` represents Circle USD. For fiat currencies, use `iso4217:CODE` (e.g., `iso4217:USD`, `iso4217:CAD`).

- **`distribution_account`** - The Stellar account address that holds the asset for distribution. Not needed for fiat assets (`iso4217`).

- **`significant_decimals`** - The number of decimal places the asset supports.

- **`sep6.enabled`** - Boolean flag to enable or disable SEP-6 (deposit/withdrawal) protocol support for this asset.

- **`sep6.deposit`** - Configuration for SEP-6 deposit operations:
  - **`enabled`** - Boolean flag indicating whether deposits are allowed for this asset
  - **`min_amount`** - Minimum deposit amount (default: 0)
  - **`max_amount`** - Maximum deposit amount (default: 999999999)
  - **`methods`** - List of deposit methods (e.g., `SEPA`, `SWIFT`, `bank_account`)

- **`sep6.withdraw`** - Configuration for SEP-6 withdrawal operations with the same fields as `sep6.deposit`:
  - **`enabled`** - Boolean flag indicating whether withdrawals are allowed
  - **`min_amount`** - Minimum withdrawal amount
  - **`max_amount`** - Maximum withdrawal amount
  - **`methods`** - List of withdrawal methods (e.g., `bank_account`, `cash`)

- **`sep24.enabled`** - Boolean flag to enable or disable SEP-24 (interactive deposit/withdrawal) protocol support.

- **`sep31.enabled`** - Boolean flag to enable or disable SEP-31 (cross-border payments) protocol support.

- **`sep38.enabled`** - Boolean flag to enable or disable SEP-38 (cross-asset payments/currency exchange) protocol support.

- **`sep38.exchangeable_assets`** - List of asset IDs (in the same format as `id`) that can be exchanged with this asset using SEP-38.

## Wallet Clients Configuration

Wallet clients are the wallet apps that connect to your Anchor Platform to perform transactions on behalf of users.

:::tip For the complete client configuration reference with all available options and detailed comments, see the [full client configuration file](https://github.com/stellar/anchor-platform/blob/main/platform/src/main/resources/config/anchor-client-default-values.yaml). :::

### Example Client Configuration

```yaml
items:
  - name: "referenceCustodial"
    type: custodial
    signing_keys:
      - GDJLB...KLTG
    callback_urls:
      sep6: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep6
      sep24: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep24
      sep31: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep31
      sep12: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep12
  - name: "reference"
    type: noncustodial
    domains:
      - wallet-server:8092
      - client.example.com
    callback_urls:
    ...
```

### Field Explanations

**Custodial Client Configuration:**

- **`name`** (Required) - A unique identifier for the client.

- **`type: custodial`** (Required) - The type of the client. Must be set to `custodial` for custodial clients.

- **`signing_keys`** (Required) - A list of Stellar public keys used for client SEP-10 authentication. The anchor uses these keys to verify that requests are coming from the authorized client.

- **`callback_urls`** (Optional) - URLs to which the service can send callbacks for different SEP types.
  - **`sep6`** - Callback URL for SEP-6 (deposit/withdrawal) transaction status updates
  - **`sep24`** - Callback URL for SEP-24 (interactive deposit/withdrawal) transaction status updates
  - **`sep31`** - Callback URL for SEP-31 (cross-border payments) transaction status updates
  - **`sep12`** - Callback URL for SEP-12 (KYC) customer information updates

**Noncustodial Client Configuration:**

- **`name`** (Required) - A unique identifier for the client, similar to custodial clients. Typically a name that clearly represents the client entity.

- **`type: noncustodial`** (Required) - The type of the client. Must be set to `noncustodial` for noncustodial clients. Noncustodial clients allow users to control their own private keys, and the wallet acts as an interface to user-controlled accounts.

- **`domains`** (Required) - A list of domains associated with the client, used to verify the client's identity.

- **`callback_urls`** (Optional) - URLs to which the service can send callbacks for different SEP types. Works the same way as for custodial clients (see above).
