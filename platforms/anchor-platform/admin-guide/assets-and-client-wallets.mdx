# Assets and Wallet Clients

This guide covers how to configure assets and wallet clients in the Anchor Platform.

## Assets Configuration

Assets define the tokens and currencies that your Anchor Platform supports for deposits and withdrawals. In the "Getting Started" guide, assets are configured in the `config/assets.yaml` file.

### Asset Definition

Each asset in the configuration file includes:

- **Asset ID** - The asset identifier (e.g., `stellar:native` for XLM, `iso4217:USD` for fiat currencies)
- **Distribution account** - The Stellar account that holds the asset for distribution (required for Stellar assets)
- **Significant decimals** - The number of decimal places for the asset
- **SEP protocol support** - Configuration for SEP-6, SEP-24, SEP-31, and SEP-38 protocols
- **Operation settings** - Deposit/withdrawal limits, methods, and enabled status

### Example Asset Configuration

```yaml
items:
  - id: stellar:native
    distribution_account: "G...DIST"
    significant_decimals: 7
    sep6:
      enabled: true
      deposit:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - SEPA
          - SWIFT
      withdraw:
        enabled: true
        min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 10
        methods:
          - bank_account
          - cash
    sep24:
      enabled: true
    sep38:
      enabled: true
      exchangeable_assets:
        - iso4217:USD
```

The snippet above shows an example asset configuration. Here's what each field means:

- `id`: The asset identifier, such as `stellar:native` for XLM or `iso4217:USD` for fiat currencies.
- `distribution_account`: The Stellar account address that holds the asset for SEP-6 and SEP-24 distribution.
- `significant_decimals`: The number of decimal places for the asset (7 for XLM).
- `sep6`, `sep24`, `sep38`: Configuration blocks for each SEP protocol, including enabled status, deposit/withdraw settings, min/max amounts, payment methods, and exchangeable assets.

## Wallet Clients Configuration

Wallet clients are the wallet apps that connect to your Anchor Platform to perform transactions on behalf of users. Clients are configured in the `config/clients.yaml` file.

### Client Definition

Each client configuration includes:

- **Client name** (Required) - A unique identifier for the client
- **Client type** (Required) - Either `custodial` or `noncustodial`
- **Signing keys** - List of public keys used for SEP-10 authentication
- **Domains** - List of domains associated with the client, used to verify the client's identity
- **Callback URLs** (Optional) - URLs for sending callbacks for different SEP types (SEP-6, SEP-24, SEP-31, SEP-12). Optional because some wallets may poll instead
- **Allow any destination** (Optional) - Boolean flag that allows any destination for deposits. Defaults to `false`
- **Destination accounts** (Optional) - List of accounts authorized for deposits. Ignored if `allowAnyDestination` is `true`

### Example Client Configuration

```yaml
items:
  - name: "referenceCustodial"
    type: custodial
    signing_keys:
      - GDJLB...KLTG
    callback_urls:
      sep6: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep6
      sep24: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep24
      sep31: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep31
      sep12: https://client.example.com/callbacks/sep12
  - name: "reference"
    type: noncustodial
    domains:
      - wallet-server:8092
      - client.example.com
    callback_urls:
      sep6: http://wallet-server:8092/callbacks/sep6
      sep24: http://wallet-server:8092/callbacks/sep24
      sep31: http://wallet-server:8092/callbacks/sep31
      sep12: http://wallet-server:8092/callbacks/sep12
```

The snippet above shows example client configurations. Here's what each field means:

- `name`: (Required) A unique identifier for the client.
- `type`: (Required) Either `custodial` (client holds user funds) or `noncustodial` (connects to external wallet servers).
- `signing_keys`: (Required for custodial) A list of public keys used for SEP-10 authentication. The Anchor Platform uses these keys to verify JWT tokens signed by the client.
- `domains`: (Required) A list of domains associated with the client, used to verify the client's identity.
- `callback_urls`: (Optional) URLs for sending callbacks for different SEP types (SEP-6, SEP-24, SEP-31, SEP-12). This is optional because some wallets may poll for updates instead of using callbacks. Available for both custodial and noncustodial clients.
