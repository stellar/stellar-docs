## Overview

Stellar smart wallet applications create authenticated sessions with Stellar anchors by proving they, or their users, have sufficient control over a contract account. Once authenticated, the smart wallet application uses a session token provided by the anchor in subsequent requests to the anchor's standardized services.

This is similar to how SEP-10 works, but with a few differences:

- The challenge is a list of Soroban authorization entries for an invocation of a SEP-45 contract that must be signed by the contract account's signers.
- The wallet is responsible for simulating the transaction and ensuring it is not malicious.
- The anchor verifies the signed authorization entries by simulating the transaction on the network.

An implementation of the SEP-45 contract is provided in the [Anchor Platform repository][sep-45-contract]. An instance of this contract is deployed at `CD3LA6RKF5D2FN2R2L57MWXLBRSEWWENE74YBEFZSSGNJRJGICFGQXMX` on testnet.

## Enable Stellar Authentication for Contract Accounts

The Anchor Platform supports this form of authentication with minimal configuration from the business.

### Connect to Stellar RPC

SEP-45 requires integration with Stellar RPC to simulate transactions. The Anchor Platform can connect to the Stellar RPC server of your choice.

You can use a public Stellar RPC provider, or you can run your own. A list of public providers can be found [here][rpc-providers]. The following example uses SDF's testnet RPC.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
STELLAR_NETWORK_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
```

</CodeExample>

### Enable SEP-45

To enable SEP-45, set the following environment variables in your `dev.env` file.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP_45_ENABLED=true
SEP_45_WEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SEP_45_WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID="CD3LA6RKF5D2FN2R2L57MWXLBRSEWWENE74YBEFZSSGNJRJGICFGQXMX"
SEP_45_HOME_DOMAINS=localhost:8080
SEP_45_JWT_TIMEOUT=900
SEP_45_AUTH_TIMEOUT=86400
```

</CodeExample>

`SEP_45_ENABLED` enables SEP-45.

`SEP_45_WEB_AUTH_DOMAIN` is the domain where the authentication service (WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT or WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT) is running. This might be the same as the `home_domain`, a subdomain (e.g., auth.example.com), or a completely different domain. It's verified in the challenge to ensure the client is talking to the correct server endpoint it discovered via the `home_domain`.

`SEP_45_WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` is the contract ID of the SEP-45 contract. This is the contract that will be used to construct the challenge.

`SEP_45_HOME_DOMAINS` is a comma-separated list of home domains that are allowed to authenticate with the anchor. Home domains are the domains hosting the `stellar.toml` file. This file tells clients where to find the authentication endpoint (`WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT`) and which public key (`SIGNING_KEY`) the server will use for challenges.

`SEP_45_JWT_TIMEOUT` is the time in seconds that the JWT token is valid. The default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).

`SEP_45_AUTH_TIMEOUT` is the time in seconds that the authentication challenge is valid. The default is 86400 seconds (24 hours).

### Modify a Stellar Info File

The `stellar.toml` file created [earlier][sep1-ap] must be updated to include the new authentication endpoint and contract ID.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/sep45/auth"
WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID = "CD3LA6RKF5D2FN2R2L57MWXLBRSEWWENE74YBEFZSSGNJRJGICFGQXMX"
```

</CodeExample>

`WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT` is the URL where the authentication service is running. This is the URL that clients will use to authenticate with the anchor.

`WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` is the contract ID of the SEP-45 contract. This is the contract that will be used to construct the challenge.
