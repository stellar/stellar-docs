This guide will walk you through configuring and integrating with the Anchor Platform for the purpose of building a cross-border payments recieve-side service compatible with [SEP-31][sep-31], the ecosystem's standardized protocol for cross-border payments.

By leveraging the Anchor Platform's support for SEP-31, businesses make their service compatible with Stellar's existing set of send-side services.

As we improve the documentation, parts of this guide that are relevant to other use cases may be moved into their own sections.

Before continuing with this section, make sure that you have already [installed][installation-ap] the Anchor Platform and configured the necessary features required by SEP-31: [SEP-1 (Stellar Info File)][sep1-ap], [SEP-10 (Stellar Authentication)][sep10-ap] and [SEP-45 (Stellar Web Authentication for contract account)][sep45-ap].
