Bridge integration endpoints for connecting organizations with Bridge services.

**Integration Flow:**
1. Organization opts into Bridge (OPTED_IN status)
2. Complete KYC verification process via Bridge
3. Create virtual account for USD deposits (READY_FOR_DEPOSIT status)
4. Receive USD deposits that are automatically converted to USDC on Stellar

**Status Description:**
- NOT_ENABLED → Bridge service not configured
- NOT_OPTED_IN → Organization hasn't opted in
- OPTED_IN → Organization opted in, KYC link created
- READY_FOR_DEPOSIT → Virtual account created, ready for deposits
- ERROR → Integration error occurred
