Stellar Disbursement Platform services can be configured using a set of configuration options that are passed to the command line or set as environment variables.
Depending on how you're using and deploying the SDP, these configurations can be set in a ConfigMap in Kubernetes, as environment variables in a Docker container, passed in as command line arguments, etc.

In this section we will discuss the different configuration options available for the SDP.

**Notes:**
* Configurations that are tagged with  ðŸ”‘ are sensitive and should be stored securely.
* These configurations are valid for version 2.x of the SDP.
* All configurations can be passed in as either environment variables or CLI flags. For instance, the env var `BASE_URL` could be passed in through the `--base-url` flag. CLI flags take priority over env vars, even though env vars are more convenient.

## SDP Core Service

For the most up-to-date configuration, you can run the following command in the [stellar-disbursement-platform-backend git repository](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend):

<CodeExample>

```bash
./stellar-disbursement-platform serve --help
```

</CodeExample>
