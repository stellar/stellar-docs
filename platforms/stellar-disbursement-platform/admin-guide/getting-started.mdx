### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and start it once installed.
- **Git:** You will need Git to clone the repository. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Go:** Required to generate your environment file. Install from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **jq:** Useful for optional scripts and diagnostics. You can download it from [here](https://jqlang.org/download/)

For macOS, Linux, you can install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask docker
brew install git go jq
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend.git
cd stellar-disbursement-platform-backend
```

### Run the wizard

```bash
make setup
```

At the prompts, choose according to below. The wizard generates and funds the SEP-10 signer and distribution accounts (testnet), starts Docker, and prints tenant credentials.

```
? Select an existing run configuration or create new:
▸ Create new configuration
✔ Setup name (optional): <sdp-setup-name>
? Select network:
▸ testnet
? Select tenant mode:
▸ single-tenant
? Account setup:
▸ Generate new accounts
? Launch local environment now (project=sdp-sdp-test, setup=<sdp-setup-name>)? [Y/n] Y
? Initialize tenants and users? [y/N] Y
```

After completion you should see:

```
🎉🎉🎉🎉 SUCCESS! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Single tenant mode - Login URL:
🔗Default tenant: http://localhost:3000
  username: owner@default.local  password: Password123!
```

### Log into the SDP

Open http://localhost:3000 and log in using the admin credentials generated by the setup wizard (organization: default). ![Login](/assets/SDP/SDP32.png)

### Send a test disbursement

Click `New Disbursement +` on the dashboard; you’ll see a funded distribution account ready to use:

- Choose a phone number as the Registration Contact Type. This is the channel recipients will use to receive messages.
- Select XLM as the asset to disburse.
- Pick Demo Wallet as the recipient wallet.
- Choose Date of Birth as the verification method; recipients will enter it to confirm their identity.
- Give disbursement a name. ![Disbursement Details](/assets/SDP/SDP33.png)

Create and Upload a Disbursement File:

- Download the sample via `Download CSV Template`; it includes all required columns.
- Update the placeholder/invalid phone numbers before using it.
- The verification column holds the identity data recipients must match. ![Disbursement CSV](/assets/SDP/SDP34.png)

Click the Review button. When you are ready to start the disbursement, click the "Confirm disbursement" button. In Disbursement Details you’ll see the payment in `Ready` status, meaning the receiver has yet to accept the invitation and deposit the funds. ![Disbursement Dashboard](/assets/SDP/SDP35.png)

### Receive Payment

Claim the payment in the demo wallet by first creating a wallet:

- Open the demo wallet: http://localhost:4000.
- Click `Generate Keypair for new account` to create a keypair; save the public and secret keys if you plan to reuse the account.
- Click `Create account` to create the account on the Stellar testnet (the account starts with 10,000 XLM). ![Demo Wallet Creation](/assets/SDP/SDP36.png)

To receive your payment, initialize a SEP-24 deposit:

- Under Asset XLM, click `Add Home Domain`, enter `localhost:8000`, and click `Override`.
- In the `Select action` dropdown, choose `SEP-24 Deposit`, then click `Start`. ![SEP-24 Deposit](/assets/SDP/SDP37.png)

Verify your identity:

- When prompted, enter the same phone number used in the disbursement CSV.
- Complete the OTP and Date of Birth verification. The OTP appears in the `sdp-api` container logs (e.g., “Here is the 6-digit verification code you requested ...”). ![OTP Code](/assets/SDP/SDP38.png) ![PII Verification](/assets/SDP/SDP39.png)

### Monitoring

- In the SDP dashboard, the payment moves from `Ready` to `PENDING` during the wallet flow, then to `Success` when funds are deposited. ![SDP Dashboard](/assets/SDP/SDP40.png)

- In the demo wallet, the balance updates to reflect the new amount. ![Demo Wallet Balance](/assets/SDP/SDP41.png)
