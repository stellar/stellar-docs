If the tenant was created with a [Circle] distribution account, then the tenant will need to manually configure that account from within the SDP dashboard.

Once a user with owner priviledges logs in, they will see a banner at the top of the page saying that the Ciecle account is pending configuration:

Clicking on the banner will take the user to the Distribution Account section, where they can enter the Circle API key and the Circle Wallet ID:
