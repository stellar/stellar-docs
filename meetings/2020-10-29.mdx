If you’re building a product on Stellar — or on any blockchain — one of the first and most consequential decisions you’ll face is how to manage users’ secret keys. Custodial solutions keep keys on behalf of users, while non-custodial solutions place keys directly in users’ hands. These two approaches are often presented as opposites, carrying different technical, regulatory, and philosophical implications.

In this ecosystem roundtable, builders and Stellar ecosystem leaders debate which approach matters most right now. Drawing on real-world product experience, the panel discusses how custodial and non-custodial designs affect usability, compliance, recovery, and adoption, especially as Stellar applications reach beyond crypto-native users toward mainstream audiences.

Panelists shared real-world experiences building wallets, anchors, and financial products for non-crypto users, highlighting how usability, recovery, compliance, and customer trust often matter more than ideological purity. The discussion also explored how newer protocol features and ecosystem standards could shift the balance by making both custodial and self-custodial designs easier to implement safely.

### Key Topics

- How custodial and non-custodial key management differ in practice and in philosophy
- Tradeoffs between user sovereignty, recovery, and regulatory responsibility
- Why enterprises increasingly adopt custodial designs as applications scale
- How CAP-27 (multiplexed accounts) could simplify custodial architectures
- How SEP-30 (recovery signer) could improve non-custodial key recovery
- Which key management approach the Stellar ecosystem should prioritize next

[01:00] The chat. Yeah, we're live, all right, hello. Hi everyone. It's a pleasure to have you with us today. I, my name is Lisa nester. I am a senior strategist at the Stellar Development Foundation and you are joining us for our third roundtable discussion, second topic that we've ever covered, and we are very happy to have you with us today.

[02:00] So I guess, to get started, I'd love to. kind of frame again the purpose of these roundtable discussions. Hopefully we're going to have a lot of audience members and viewers joining in and we'd love to invite you into the discussion as well. And then I'll jump into what the topic for today is. So, in general, at the Stellar Development Foundation, you know we want to make sure that we're facilitating broad, inclusive, ecosystem driven discussion around the types of tools that the Stellar ecosystem needs to continue to grow on and have successful use cases and businesses utilizing Stellar. And so, in that regard, we've started these enterprise roundtable discussions to invite key enterprises within the Stellar ecosystem to sit down at a table with various members of the seller development foundation to discuss topics that are really timely and important for the growth of the ecosystem right now and, as I've mentioned, we also live

[03:00] Stream these events and have a Q&A box for any viewers so that we really can do our best to include all of the voices in the ecosystem. So if you're watching us and you have comments or questions as we go through this discussion, please drop them in the chat box and we'll do our best to respond and include those perspectives. So, for the discussion today, we're going to be talking about custodial versus non custodial applications in the Stellar ecosystem, and so why is this an important topic? Well, the truth is that if you're building a product on Stellar or any blockchain network, really one of the first things you have to figure out is how to manage your user secret keys. There are two fundamentally different approaches that are seemingly practically and philosophically at odds. Custodial solution: keeps- keep keys on behalf of users, and non custodial solutions: put keys into users hands. And I think,

[04:00] Put keys into users hands, and I think most of us would agree that during the early days of Stellar and also within the broader crypto landscape, non custodial wallet designs were kind of by and far the default. In my opinion, this is because the novelty of kind of being your own bank and having direct access to digital assets drove forward applications and wallets that were primarily not custodial nature. However, as the Stellar ecosystem has grown over the last few years, we have seen more custodial design approaches by enterprise and our ecosystem. So that's why we're opening up this discussion today, because we've seen a lot of growth in applications on Stellar that are getting more and more users. We think it's a great time to check in on how wallets are currently set up, experiences people are having and how they're thinking about moving forward. And then also we have two, at least two kind of specific technical developments within the Stellar ecosystem that are worth checking in on as

[05:00] They're related to the specific topic at hand. So one is [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md). So [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) is allows first class multi multiplex accounts. This was included in Protocol 13 and it basically allows services to map a single seller account to multiple users and it could make custodial solutions a lot easier to build. On the other hand, we also have SEP 30, which is a recovery signer, and this defines an api that enables a user to regain access to a Stellar account after losing a private key, without providing a third party control of the account. We're actually really lucky to have the key architect for SEP 30, Lee from the SDF, joining us today, and this solution in particular is something that could make non custodial solutions a bit easier. So, kind of checking in on where things are at and also thinking about these two new technical developments, this is going to be the focus of our discussion today on custodial versus

[06:00] Non custodial solutions. So with that, I would love to get started, and I would love to start by having- our fantastic guests join us. I will call you out just because we're on screen and not in person. So if I can invite marco to stardust, hello, thanks for having us here. My name is marco. I am one of the co founders at saldo mx and anchor service for the mexican peso. Wonderful thanks, marco. All right, how about meinhard next? Yes, so yeah, my name is mayanhard and I'm the CEO and founder of satoshi pay, and recently we launched d transfer, which is a b2b cross border money transfer service, and that's kind of the main focus of what we're doing right now. Awesome and actually for god. I said that I was going to ask a special surprise question. So we'll come back to

[07:00] You, marco, and this goes straight to you: mine hard, any new quarantine hobbies that you've picked up over the last nine months. We'll say 20 new hobbies, not strictly your hobby, but I meditate every day. So that's going to be something I picked up. Okay, this time, yeah, awesome, marco. Well, this is exactly. I mean not a hobby either, but I've been like learning a lot of cooking months, so yeah, and I enjoy it. So happy. Hopefully other people are enjoying it too. That's awesome, that's great, cool, and then I will turn it over to you. Christian. Yes, thanks for having me. I'm christian, the CTO and co-founder of d stock so we do tokenized securities such as apple and tesla and make them tradeable on the DEX. And

[08:00] Yeah, we're live, since I think not. And or three months, and have looked deep into custodial solutions quite late, great, and any quarantine hobbies that you picked up? Not really hobbies, actually. So actually the thing is, in germany there was a lockdown of schools as well. So I was like, after doing a lot of cryptographic math in the last year, I was doing a lot of primary school mars this year when I was had to teach my daughter. So that has become my hobby. That's fair enough, that's good, all right, and so next I'll hand it over to Justin from the SDF. Hi, I'm Justin, head of ecosystem at the Stellar Development Foundation, excited to be here, obviously. Well, my team, we care a lot about what the ecosystem is doing and whenever there are improvements or changes, part of what we try to find out is whether they work for the ecosystem and also how to get them out there. so that everybody's using them in a way that makes things interoperable. So very interested to hear people's feedback. My quarantine hobby so far is: that's

[09:00] An important hobby. I hope everyone checks it out. Any homeowner should make sure to develop that hobby. I live in an old house and it turns out there was a lot of asbestos and okay, that just becomes a consuming thing. It can. Yeah, absolutely okay. And then, last but not least, lee. Yeah, hi, I'm liam khalik. I'm a software engineer at the Stellar Development Foundation and I contribute to sets like sub 30 septem. And yeah, I'm just really interested in custodial and non custodial solutions and how we make them interoperable. Well, sounds like you're in the right place, lee, but you can. You don't get away without letting us know if you have any quarantine hobbies as well. Similar to christian definitely

[10:00] Became a teacher as well. Okay, those are skills that will pay off, though, I'm sure. So that's great. I myself picked up skateboarding and this thing called a rip stick. A little bit. That's kind of like a cool. That was you know a good way to, when maybe there's no commute. It was a nice way to spend the afternoons after work. So, okay, great, well, I would love to dive in, I guess, straight into the meat of it, which is: I'd love to hear what each of you are doing for your current custodial strategy with estoc and saldo and satoshi bay, and you know maybe a little bit about why you chose that approach and how you're thinking about things now moving forward. So, minehart, perhaps we'll start with you, sure? So at satoshi bay, we essentially have three major services. One is the micro payment service that we're known for micropayment for digital content. Then there's obviously the solar wallet, open

[11:00] Source Stellar wallet, and then recently there's d transfer, and all of them, use a wallet solution. That's self custodial and I'm saying self control here because internally we use that word instead of non custodial because we think non custodial is a bit misleading because there is a custodian which is yourself, and so we chose to be self custodial essentially just to have everything be software, and all the trust is in software and not in any external party, not even us. This helps us to move further or to release products to the market much quicker, and also has removed a huge overhead in potential regulation or regulatory requirements that we have to fulfill so we can just push out the software and sort of have people manage their own private keys and therefore being really just a software provider in that sense. And that being said so, for d transfer, we

[12:00] Recently also released a self custodial resolution- on monday actually to production, and here we really give users the full control over the funds, and also the reason again is a regulatory one. However, in the future we plan to give users a choice, maybe that they can either have a custodial solution by us or by some other external, the custodial party that we partner with, or even combine both approaches. That's super interesting. I mean, is that something that would be a relatively easy opt in decision to kind of automate from a back end perspective, or would these need to be two totally separate kind of infrastructure solutions? So yeah, so the combination would be very separate, or not very, but a pretty separate legal, let's say, connections that we have with our users, and also technically it would be quite different. Yeah, so that's

[13:00] Also where the different CAPs and SEPs come into play, each on their side. So it's going to be quite some development work and also some, let's say, legal ground work that we have to lay first, what is motivating you to consider adding this second solution where you provide custody, mainly user experience, because a lot of the customers we have are not familiar with this sort of power that self has, so also the power to lose your money. Essentially, and that is something we want to maybe give users the choice if they, you know, want to be in full control, or if they trust us with a certain amount of their money, or even all of their money, like a more like a bank like service. It's also right now we didn't find a custody partner yet and also we're not regulated in that way. So it's we can't actually legally launch a

[14:00] Self or- sorry, a custodial solution at this point, but we can launch the self custodial and that's why we move forward. With that, we can now handle bigger transactions as well. As much as there's digits and there's, let's say, a Stellar code, we can add like even very large amounts if we want. That's great. I really want to dive into some of those points more specifically around. You know the usability side of things and I'm also kind of curious to hear for the users that you think would want a non custodial solution, kind of what is a driver or motivator there as well. But maybe let's go ahead and jump to marco to get a little bit more of our landscape about where we're all currently or where you're currently sitting. Yeah, thanks. Well, philosophically, I'm personally very aligned

[15:00] With the self custody movement that you know cryptocurrency has started and I don't see, for example, in single asset blockchain such as bitcoin, the really the need of thinking through like custodial solutions. But however I've seen Stellar since the very beginning seeing and realizing the market opportunity of representing real world assets on this public network and allow exchanges and transfers, and that requires a lot of companies like ours to that are regulated entities capable of holding value for, on the behalf of their users, to participate, and the needs actually that these companies have is they're very different because,

[16:00] Like, they want to leverage the, this ability to hold people's funds and be able to, like, improve usability as much as possible and remove any friction that can be created by the self custody approach, which we all know very well. And I think, what we've seen is under development, especially, you know, from the ecosystem of standards that can help expand those custodial solutions, and I think that's something that we should think through more and focus, because, the same way that in cryptocurrency has been like expanding,

[17:00] Thanks in big part, to exchanges which are custodial solutions, I think that it, at the end of the day, it, I think that it, at the end of the day, it will be extremely beneficial for all if more custodial solutions are able to adopt the kind of the Stellar protocol in a way that makes sense for them and, in that way, increase the use of the whole network and benefit, including, like, those players that are using self custody solutions. Yeah, I mean, I think that this is, you know, it's. I think there's kind of a philosophical point of tension here. Where you know, I think many of the people within the Stellar community really like the financial sovereignty that blockchain can provide, but there's also typically a deep desire to create impact, to use a platform like Stellar to provide

[18:00] More access to financial products and services for everyone. Right, and so how do we do that In really simple ways? Or how do we do that in ways that work across user types outside of just people who really understand cryptocurrency? So, but, marco, can you help clarify? How does saldo actually work? How are you set up right now? Yeah, so we as an anchor, support like both, like approaches. So if someone wants to, you know, utilize our services through a non custodial solution like Lobstr, they can go ahead and do it, but we're also maintaining a service that it's called smx, that it's our custodial solution, that we believe it's really important for the business development of our company. So that, basically, is a very easy way to

[19:00] Use a wallet that allows especially mexicans who are in the us working hard and sending money over to hold a little bit of mexican pesos in a digital way, and that replaces the need to go and cross the border and open a bank account, which is almost impossible for the majority of them. So, like, we are really focusing on this community, which is not tech savvy, he's not a part of the crypto community at all- and we've been like super motivated from what we've seen, and this is a community that actually could not care less about like the self sovereign aspect of crypto, but they just want, like, the task to be done, and so they we've been like developing these with these people in mind, and that's, for our company, a big focus right now, and we also want to make it compatible with any other Stellar-based solution. But in

[20:00] Our approach- this is in fully custodial way of doing the, of using our anchor gotcha, and it sounds like you already have some thoughts on where there could be more support within the Stellar ecosystem for being able to kind of launch these types of products. Yeah, I think that you know they're already there- a lot of interesting discussions like the moxed, like multiplexed accounts that you mentioned. But probably we- yeah, we, and I'm sure we will talk more about this later on, but I think that it's in general, very interesting just to kind of like see what the users are doing and just like see that basically the entire world it's gonna take a long time for the majority of people to adopt

[21:00] Like the self custody tools out there, and I think that we should like be kind of like aware that there's a path towards that kind of like decentralization and, in the meantime, it's really important to serve the people that they want to be served in a specific way and for us, like we are at a stage in which is really important to provide a custodial and easy to use solutions like this. Great, yeah, and I think we definitely will dive into some of these various things like multiplexed accounts, more so great. Thank you so much, marco and christian. I know you guys have had an interesting journey with these talks, so we'd love to hear about what you guys are using, how you set things up and how you're thinking about the future. Yeah, I already have a lot of points I want to touch on. So, yeah, maybe I can start with. There are. Yeah,

[22:00] Maybe I can start with. There are actually two different ways: how you- or multiple ways, actually how you can use these stock technologies. So, first of all, there's an api layer which basically everyone can use. It uses Stellar standards and people can build products on top of it, and for that one, we actually don't have any opinion on what the user, how the user protects his key, his or her keys. So we just basically verify the user and where he's coming from- if it's not like a terrorist, something like that- and then they can use their account to trade our assets, but we as well- that's our actually main product do. We have a mobile app and, because countries we serve emerging markets, there's a mobile first approach and this app is actually not targeting crypto users. So if you want to use, if you're a Stellar heavy user and you want to use these stock assets, you can use, for example, Lobstr wallet or something like that. But for already non crypto users who are new to investing and haven't had touch points at all with

[23:00] Crypto in the past, it's actually quite of a hard concept to grasp: to create a private key. So, like currently in our onboarding process, which is self custodial- I'm going to start to use this word as well- it's an xd minor- the people actually in the onboarding process have to create a private key and we see actually some kind of a drop off rate right on that. So it's like people have a hard time doing that. So I understand that they're a bit scared. Maybe they don't understand it and things like that, so that's a problem actually to us and I think, to everyone who wants to build end user product, that's not just targeting early adopted adopters. And the tricky part on this one is like: in the very heart of d stock is that d stock itself does not hold customer customers funds. So that's the basic idea: how we can actually pull off the entire business, and that's true for most of crypto companies, I guess that they don't hold customers funds and are

[24:00] Therefore eligible to cut off a lot of middlemen that are normally required in financial transactions. And yeah, so basically, if we want to go away from that- and we're actually planning to do that, so we need to- we want to find a solution that makes it easier for undo this. We have to go to some way. that's not only self custodial and I'm not saying: well, let me phrase it differently. The first thing that we need to define or that we have to talk about is what actually does custodian, what does the custodial solution mean in this case? And this definition isn't actually as clear as I would as one would guess. So we're always talking about: okay, they're self solving their self custodial solutions and custodial solutions. But the definition of custodial is quite a bit more complex. I've read it to the bit. For example, the barfin, which is a german equivalent, roughly the icc in america, defines custody as someone who's holding a funds off on behalf of other people, is able to transfer them, make payments with that and all this kind of stuff and

[25:00] All holds a private key that's eligible to do that. And for example, in SEP 30, that's where you say, okay, we're splitting off weights between third parties that need to jointly recover a key for user. That's not really that definition. So it's not really clear. That's actually a custodial solution that would require regulations. So like by the very definition of financial regulators it may not be, but it's actually not that clear because it's just basically new land. So nobody has actually challenged that. Maybe the regulators weren't even aware that their weighted keys- things like that, says the entire field is it's not as easy as it gets. So for us it's like very crucial to find a solution where we say, okay, people will be able to recover the key, but I wouldn't call that a custodian, custodial solution, because the people does do not hold the funds of the user in custody, they're not able to transfer

[26:00] Them, doing stuff with that and, more importantly, they are not able to. Yeah, then they don't have to do insurance and things like that for it. So, yeah, that's the basic thing. I'll sing around it. So customian solutions are non custodials who should be. It's not the only thing in the real midst as well, just mainly for us about key recovery that we want to try to solve. That's great. I mean, I guess I'm curious: do you, mine, heart or marco, have kind of like a similar opinion or reaction? Extremely relevant and interesting because, for example, I think that, for you know, for a lot of regulators, the fact that a user of a regulated entity actually goes and does something and loses the private key is not sufficient, like for the regulator to

[27:00] Just be fined the legal obligation. You know that the company, has still is a valid payment obligation that the company needs to honor. So I think it's not sufficient just to you know like it's like the key management will not remove or will not make go away that legal kind of like obligation that some custodial companies have and that it's something that it's very like valid across, like all the kind of like real world assets, including currencies and I think you know, like at that point, like you realize, that somehow, for example, if a user of our anchor loses like the private key and you still see the funds, you at least need to show that you have a process to be

[28:00] Able to, in a way, cancel those funds or do something with that account and then like credit back those tokens to the new or like re key kind of like. You know, like doing those things, it's it helps companies like ours to comply with local regulations that are not aware of, like what private keys can do, and I think it's like super interesting and makes companies like ours realize that it's a very complex topic. That is an interesting point you make. Oh, you go first planet, okay, then that's interesting. Okay, sorry for that. That's an interesting point to raise. I mean when you, when you're anchoring an asset,

[29:00] You always have the option to freeze it and, okay, it's still on chain and it's a bit harder to keep track of it, but it's still in an automated way. You can prove that this assets are frozen when you, for example, kind of take away trust lines and then you can issue the token, the assets new, and that's. It's somewhat of a cumbersome way. It may be easier in the future because there are some proposed changes to Stellar to reclaim assets, but this is some way for us, for example, to recover funds at the moment, even if the people lose their key in their self custodial solution, the problem is actually not from that. So we can always do that. The problem is merely if the user just, for example, deposits a million in excel and then loses this key or her key or the same for stablecoin. So may not be able up to this process, so, but the interesting idea of just reading the assets and reissuing them to new accounts is always an option as well. That's so

[30:00] You don't have to, so that you just so up the old account when you lose the key. Just on that briefly. Obviously you need to flag the asset as being revocable and, yeah, there's acid types where you work, there's configurations where you don't have that. So if you forgot to do that or if you didn't plan for that, then obviously that's not possible either. So what we've done in our micro payments product- actually we used a little bit of a trick there. So we are co signing all the transactions that are being done from for the micropens wallets and we also have a time locked transaction that we issue with each payment, meaning that after a certain period of time, the funds will return back to us. if no other transactions have been made, meaning that if the user loses a key and they flag us, they tell us that they did so we will simply not co sign any transactions from that key anymore. And then after

[31:00] Half a year- I think it's currently after time that we have programmed- we can then recover these funds. That means we can issue even lumens to the users from. We kind of give out a bit of our liquidity beforehand, but in that way we can also sort of have a account recovery for accounts that actually are lost, but the funds will come back to us later after half a year, sort of a workaround for that issue. But isn't co signing the definition of it not being as purely self custodial depends on the type of weight a key has. So if you have, you know like a minority weight, and then so I don't know how the regulator sees different types of water signatures, because that's also depending on the chain. Obviously I well, it's, a hybrid. I would say a

[32:00] Hybrid, I would say yeah, and I think you know just to kind of respond here. So one I wanted to flag: christian had mentioned a CAP on Stellar which I wanted to name, just if anybody's watching- yeah, [CAP-35](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0035.md), which is the asset clawback CAP, which is a new proposal. So if anyone's interested in exploring that further. But you know, this is really interesting because it still feels like we're dancing around these areas of kind of how can you stay lean, and you know I would say kind of do things that allow you as an organization to kind of have a leaner regulatory framework as authentic, along with things that are more tied to kind of like usability and how do we make

[33:00] Experiences for consumers to that can keep their information safe but still provide kind of like non confusing not overburdened, some experiences on the product. I mean, do you guys see any other major areas that are kind of- I'll say kind of like- dancing around the surface here? Because I know we're kind of talking back and forth about various designs, but it feels like there's kind of like larger themes or larger questions, So maybe I can start because I mean we've been like also thinking about this. The problem is that if, honestly, it is true that it removes liability, the fact that you can actually delegate the key management to your users, and that, like, fundamentally, will remove like

[34:00] Regular regulatory, like load, the problem is that if you see what happens in fintech, is that okay Regulation is more expensive than software, sure, but is it at the top of the list? I don't think so. It's like you have software which is cheap and then you have regulation which is way more expensive, and then you have distribution. So if you see, like, what's the big expenses that the companies have, it's most like distribution. A customer acquisition cost is what sometimes kills like the unit economics. So it's not regulation at all, even if it's like super expensive. So I think that a lot of companies realize that okay, yeah, there's some efficiencies to be made in that you know liability that goes away, but it's not the entire story. So you still will need to go and find the users, and that's like

[35:00] Extremely expensive, and then sometimes it's even more expensive if you need to make them learn what like a 12 like 12 word password means or what like a mechanism to like that it's not intuitive- is to recover like the secret key for your funds, so that those things will add costs to that very like heavy cost of customer acquisition or will reduce that- the universe of people that you can target. And I think that's something that from the business perspective, it's not very positive. So I have a question which is, basically, if you had something I mean and this sort of relates specifically to SEP 30, which I think is a very clever way to give users access to their account

[36:00] Without ever having them to touch a password or know a secret key or use a backup recovery phase. They can basically log into a Stellar account using just their phone number or their email address- some proof of identity, right? So with a solution like that- you know well, I guess there's two questions. One: does a solution like that solve the user experience and allow you to create a non custodial sort of interface or solution that doesn't feel that sort of obfuscates the crypto nature of an app from a user? Like, basically, can using something like sub30 make it so that a user experience for non custodial wallet is just like a custodial wallet one and two, if it does it solve the biggest problems or does it, does it only solve some of the problems and there are still a lot of problems left over that would still make you choose to use a custodial solution. I mean, maybe I can just quickly say that I think it's the final, quickly

[37:00] Say that I think it's the final user who will judge those things, because at the end of the day for me, it's very intuitive to use a memo ID just to identify a final user- that actually hasn't been the case for the majority of users of exchanges. So in a way, like something that feels very intuitive in from the kind of the sign point of view, and this is true across many different SEPs. That for me, makes a lot of sense, but once that they're implemented like, things become trickier, and I think that's the only thing that I could say- probably christian can say much more: yeah, well, I think well first of all. I like the basic idea of study and it's definitely a valid one. We do have some problems with it by when we want to implement it. That it's one thing that's very common among when we implement SEP ecosystem proposals for those who don't know our standards in the stutter system, that anchors or people building on

[38:00] It can implement and then everyone can use it. And it's interoperable between different clients, and that is a good thing if you're a client. For example, there is SEP 6 and SEP 24 for deposits and withdrawals from anchors and it's super nice. So basically, I am as a developer, I can go ahead and integrate 10 of them in a day and that's super nice for me as a client developer. But to be honest, it's not something I care about as a developer. What I care about is optimization of the user flow. So, for example, deposits is the most crucial thing in our flow ever and if I can increase conversion there by one percent or by ten percent, then I would do that. So it's not it's. I'm not fundamentally not interested in getting this thing done fast. I want to get it done right and currently I can't do a b testing. I can't do client side validations with SEPs and withdrawals, for example, just as an example for seventy grade. So this SEP integration as a whole focus on clients getting the job

[39:00] Done, and that's not what we want to do. And tab 30 is kind of the same thing it has. It automates the entire flow for our clients that we can just do it and then integrate a little, integrate a lot with a lot of other clients who integrate 30, but it's not coming from the perspective of the client. So, for example- I'll give you an example quite lately, quite recently, I've lost my two factor authentication and I think was coinbase and it wasn't an automated process. I had to censor my passport. There was a person talking to me and that's fine. It's something I would expect as a user and it encouraged me that this- those people do their business right. Whereas on SEP 30 if the ease of the flow is like, okay, my email, my SMS is something I wouldn't fundamentally like as a user to be connected with me. That I'm just pushing a tech away from losing my entire life saving savings. When someone captures my email and my wife quite recently changed her phone number, she doesn't even have access to a whole number anymore. So it's like it's kind of a weak thing for us and

[40:00] It focuses a lot of it's being automated. People don't have to hassle with it. It's fully integrated, it's decentralized and that's fundamentally not anything our users care about the basic care. You just want to log into the app, have an account and never care about it, and for us it would be totally fine if there would be just a person having an hd wallet in the physical world and it costs like thirty dollars or ten dollars or twenty dollars for key recovery, because if it's below it doesn't make sense anyways. If it's above, fine, or we could scale it. But having an approach that's just focusing on the client side wouldn't cut it for our users. So we would have to have a process that's more tied to the user experience, and the user doesn't want to care about that at all. I think that just for my side. I talked a lot, so maybe I'll keep it shut now. Do you think that there's like I think we've mentioned, in a few points- like there's this issue

[41:00] Of there's this issue of keys being lost, and then what do people, what do users go through to get their keys back? And then we're talking separately about the products we're developing and all the functionality they provide. Do you think that there's room for custody as a product independent of the products you're developing? So maybe I can take this one, definitely so I don't know if this is starting to christian, but definitely for us that would be something we desperately want: the ecosystem and it would have to be a custodian that supports different Stellar assets as well, and there are wallets that support lumens already and insurance that support lumix, but to extend that to other assets and maybe even traits to some extent, that would be definitely something we would want to integrate and that's actually what we're actively looking for. I would want to make again the separation between custody and key recovery.

[42:00] So we don't want to have custody, we don't want one want so traditional custody solutions work like they don't expose a private key to anyone, but even the users belonging to that, and you send transactions to some kind of signing service to give it back. so we don't want that. We won't always want to have self custody and the user be in charge of the things with his, with possession of his or her own key. What we want on top is key recovery solutions pretty much like sub 30 would offer it conceptually, with multiple recovery processes as weights where not each weight does not have the option to trade. But I understand where he was coming from. It was developed with a different thing in mind. It was what was basically developed for the use case of not only key recovery. It was as well developed for sharing keys and all kind of use cases that are required alongside, when you're not the only one having access to that key, and for that SEP,

[43:00] Study makes a totally perfect job. I think it's just like for our purposes. But we don't want one. All of those features we just basically want at any- and in a very seldom selling case someone loses his or her key, can recover it and for that I think it would be fine if there would be just like two, or three, maybe notaries or trust companies, banks, whatever- who would provide the service, and maybe just a call center or something like that where people could provide their ID's and initiate a recovery process. So for the users of ours, that would. It doesn't have to be this decentralized solution, because most of the users are not crypto maximalists who said everything needs to be decentralized and all these kind of things. One thing if I could make a proposal that's a bit more technical involved would be that it's fundamental to Stellar to have counterparty risk right, so you have to establish trust lines to assets or anchors where you say, okay, I trust those people. So they say maybe for this. You say, hello, these

[44:00] People are sitting in Europe, they are test by the regulators there. That's a bank in Europe that hold the assets in custody. So that's great, I trust those guys. I encourage you to do so. I established a trust line to these stock assets- and maybe that would be true for custodians as well, where you can say, hey, I'm establishing some kind of custodian, custodial trust lines where I say, hey, this guy can or girl or entity can hold a specific weight of my assets, so that you have it somehow baked into the protocol level. But that's just for the far future. For the very near future, it would be just basically fine to have two or three who are not, who are, who establish trust by being used by many of the enterprises building up on Stellar, marco and my heart. I'm interested if that idea appeals to the two of you also. Which idea that? Basically the idea of there being sort

[45:00] Of trusted custodian, professional custodians out there that you could, I think in general it's it fulfills a need. I've seen always Stellar as a very diverse ecosystem and I think that the problem of like discussing topics of like, one solution versus the other, it's like it's not giving the full picture of what's happening. So Stellar actually, for example, I. The way I see it, is that at least in the ecosystem we touch, there are multiple different roles and they will like, some of them like will require something like that and some of them won't. So, for example, like we're thinking, imagine a migrant worker that has the need to send over 200. That's not the same need of the market maker that facilitates, like the exchange rates that those other people benefit from, that actually move millions of dollars. So that makes completely different needs and they're both using Stellar. So

[46:00] I think in one case, so shared keys are badly needed, and in other ways, what some other projects are doing, which is like completely abstract in a way. And you know I, why would a company like ours would have the liability of the people's funds. That's because, like there aren't a lot of funds, maybe you can actually, because you're solving, probably you have, like you know, capital requirements that exceed those people's funds. So like those things will, at the end of the day, mitigate the risks and will make you capable of fronting such risks, and I think that's what I see. So in what mind, there's a lot of like sophisticated players in the storage system already in a way that understand, like, how the mechanics work, but they aren't yet as many users as I would like to see. I love to see every mexican who's working

[47:00] In a kitchen in new york using a system that touches Stellar, and when you do that, it's, in my mind, a product that completely looks like something that this community would expect and that's completely something far from something like except 30 or something like that, because they don't want to deal with that. It just one like deal with the same thing that they've been doing with other companies when things fail, and that's like the market needed. That we've seen. Yeah, absolutely, and I mean just one point that you made there that I do think is really important is that you know, even when we're thinking about the requirements for just an application. Oftentimes there's a whole kind of like broader stack of ecosystem that's required to kind of make that end product exist and everybody who's in that value chain has kind of differing needs based on what they're doing. So, yeah, I think that's fair, you know I'd say, well, we're

[48:00] In our last 15 minutes here and so, you know, I think we're already kind of doing this. But I would love to drive the discussion towards kind of identifying gaps or needs, or we could also put these as opportunities within the ecosystem. And so maybe I'll just phrase this in a slightly constraining manner- to kick things off, like if you, marco, meinhard and christian, could wave a magic wand and have like one new thing exist in the Stellar ecosystem to support your vision of key management. What would that look like? What's the number one thing that you think would be super valuable for you? Whoever wants, whoever has a response to that? I can start by the already multiplexed accounts that we've touched before. It's in general. I think that's

[49:00] Something that, in my mind, is something that was missing and I think I would love to see completely adopted. And the reason is because the way that I feel as a user like the way that memo IDs are used, it's kind of like not intuitive and it's it feels like a hack. You know, like you know every. Everyone's familiar with a payment app where you can also like include a message that travels with a payment and so. But in this specific case, we're like hacking that field, that memo field, to actually embed information and that will make the payment to route differently. So that became like the default way of adopting Stellar, like for exchanges, and I think that you know the entire ecosystem accepted that was the way to do it. But I think if there's a better way, but

[50:00] I think if there's a better way to do it- which in my mind it is multiplexed accounts- we should like, the sooner the better, adopt something like that because you can actually free that field, which is important for other use cases. As an example, the first implementation we did for bill pay actually encoded information about the bill, that like the reference of the invoice that was intended to be paid and that was encrypted and sent over the memo. So it's like to me those are things that other players may find like useful and interesting and will design that way, and if we use that field as just an additional feel that together with the address, we'll actually run the payment to a different like destination. I think that's completely, in my mind, something that shouldn't work that way and

[51:00] You know, some evidence is like people make a lot of mistakes when they're like put assets in and out of exchanges and I think it feels like it's it would be focusing on people and companies using custodial wallets. But I think it's the opposite. I think if it's widely adopted, it's something that it would be there, available for everybody, and they will like just add a more intuitive way to just send payments to an address with an amount and that will like, satisfy the need of, like the routing and all the information that needs to travel with each payment. So in my mind that's something that needs to be adopted, obviously discussed before, and for me that wouldn't be like that. So you're putting your flag down on the cap

[52:00] 27 planet in the Stellar ecosystem and I don't know where I'm going with this, but you're squarely on the [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) multiplexed account. Team- yeah, I think so, okay, great, wonderful, meinhard, looks like you maybe have a thing next. Great, yeah, so also, [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) is really interesting for us and that's something- unfortunately I can't answer. Maybe a leak and clarify: does it also sort of protects the privacy of the recipients or is it still easy to like, conclude the address that's behind it? Because that is something also we would wish to have that we have not the complete balance of all of our clients immediately visible to maybe a sender and so in a way, not anonymous but partially anonymous transactions, at least for the recipient. That would be quite interesting for us and then also something that christian earlier said, like

[53:00] A sort of a footed approach or a like federated approach for key recovery or even for a coastal resolution. That would be definitely quite interesting. And then you said I should pick one thing. but maybe also you can say a third thing. It would be a sort of regulated entities that are offering this custody as a service and not just key recovery. So that's definitely something we would. That would solve a lot of problems for us right now, because fundamentally, we're not really- also because of our consumer's perspective or our user's perspective- maximalists and like you have to own your key. Ultimately, we want to offer a transfer service that passes on all the advantages of blockchain or Stellar in this case, mainly speed and transaction cost and also the transparency, and it doesn't have to be fully self custodial in our sense, like we want to give the user

[54:00] The choice, and the user doesn't really care much about that. They should have a online banking like experience and that we need to know what's behind it and not also having the need to learn new vocabulary and new approaches. So that's like how we want to place our service. That makes sense. Yeah, I concur that. you know it seems like having, along with there being some kind of technical aspects to creating more capabilities around key management, there's also potentially ecosystem partners that we could bring in. That would really support this as well. So and then, lee, did you do you know on [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) if it adds any anonymity? Or I'm not sure if that's something you're too up-to-date on. So, yeah, so I can answer that it not specifically. So there's not like a feature [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) that would make it any more anonymous

[55:00] Than using a memo ID for a transaction. However, you know, the service that's using the services using [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md), you know, could rotate IDs for users so they could change the ID that a user is using over time. Or you use some other strategies like, that obviously has some disadvantages. If somebody is treating a [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) like a market address, as a- you know an actual address for that user, if it's changing, that could be problematic, but I feel like this is similar to virtual credit card numbers, where you have like a credit card and then you have like model ones you use for different merchants maybe or different people, things like that. Okay, great, thank you, lee. And then christian, yeah, well, there's a short time and there's long term. So basically,

[56:00] We're fundamentally focusing on non crypto users and for non crypto users, convenience is important. So there's a reason why things like what's app are more popular than things like ebay's because they are just more convenient and user slower in terms of the more convenient solution, all those. But I think that fundamentally, the key recovery is not should be easy on the recovery process. can be hard if I lose recovery process like my physical wallets, my credit cards in it- I'm up for that. It will be a complicated process to get that all sorted. So that's fine. But setting up my wallet and setting up my key- that you, that should be the easy part and for us like the easiest solution would be: just hey, on the concretion, when you create your account on d stock. We would just add two or three trusted and reputable public keys and those people do have some kind of recovery process. If I wouldn't be totally filled with work at d stock, I would

[57:00] Right now fund a company, started, start a startup, doing exactly that because there's a need for that and like, in the long term I could see that I'm better than the protocol. That's the one thing I said was having trust lines to these custodials- pretty much like you have trust lines to add to assets or anchors- would be a nice way. Maybe even you could. One could think about that when you have an account and it holds assets from multiple different anchors, that you can say that those anchors could jointly recover and cover your key by depending on the weights and how many assets you have there, as well as cloud acid clawback with [CAP-35](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0035.md) could put a great job into that. But that's like it would be awesome to have it in the protocol embedded but like for our needs it wouldn't even be required for short term solution would be just like victory. Hey, let's get two or three trustable notary solicitors, something like that out there that we all trust and where we say, hey, let's give each other it doesn't cost me a lot of money, so that it could be like small no

[58:00] Trees that are just regulated in some country and you just say, put them up, put a process behind that you can recover, and then I think it would be fine. Question just to, as a quick clarification, I'm not sure I can exactly actually conceptualize what this would look like if it was embedded in the protocol. And I know it's like very early stages, high level. But I mean, could you maybe illustrate that a little bit more like what you think that would look like? Basically that, if you have. So the basic idea currently is that you have at public keys as a signer and what you could do is when you say, hey, we create trust licenses and take that for custodian, but these custodians could jointly recover your key, even though they don't have weights in your public key could be. So basically, they would have these anchors, would have a public private keeper somewhere on the chain and this public private keeper would have the right to recover addresses. They would have been added as a

[59:00] Signer but you don't have to explicitly had them as a signer. So basically you create a trust line to three custodians and then these three custodians could jointly recover your funds but you don't have to add them as a signer, so you don't have this kind of multi signature thing added to your account. Gotcha, okay, that's really useful, great. Well, this has been a super interesting and useful discussion and I have to say- and I'm sure Justin and lee feel the same- you know there's been a lot to take in and digest. I really appreciate you guys sharing your perspective and opinion on this and I have a feeling we're kind of just kicking this discussion off. So we did have one or two questions from the audience, which I will get up in front of me in just a second, oh, not that one, there we go. So I'll just throw this out to everyone.

[01:00:00] I guess can non custodial everyone, apps connect to a bank and have a user receive funds in their native currency. So that's kind of like a non custodial to custodial payout flow. I believe the answer to this is yes. This is actually a type of payment flow that we facilitate on Stellar. Yeah, I don't know. I think this is the intention of all those, all the SEPs that have been adopted. So it's like, normally, an anchor that complies with the existing SEPs. What they would do is basically allow non custodial solution to be able to get from an anchor services like ours, like, for example, a bank informations that they can like, go from their own bank account to like the bank account that the anchor has, and then that would in exchange, you

[01:01:00] Know, give the user some equivalent of tokens. So that flow. It's precisely how today all of the active anchors are doing. Yeah, you can use Lobstr or vibrant to deposit a number of different anchors because they already interoperate. Perfect, great thanks, guys. And then maybe Justin this one's for you: SEP 30 and [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md)- both look cool. Do any of the dev libraries or wallets support these currently? Yeah, that's an interesting question and part of why I think it was good to start to have this discussion. [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md), which marco advocated for earlier but has come up a couple of times, is called multiplexed accounts. It adds a new kind of Stellar address at the protocol level, basically allows a single Stellar account to map to multiple users. It was added to Protocol 13. However, there's- it's kind of like we put

[01:02:00] In the wiring but we didn't put any put or switches right like there's no manifestation of this and Horizon are in the SDKs and there's no clear way, no clear like methods or standards for actually using these mixed accounts. So they're there, they're just hidden away, and so with those [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) specifically, in order to really be able to use it, we'd first have to build out the sort of platform layers on top of the protocol and then we'd have to start working with people to figure out how they would actually use those. So [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) is possible, but not really implemented in any existing applications. SEP 30, on the other hand, which is not at the protocol level, right. It basically specifies how you can split key recovery across multiple different servers run by different, by different operators, right. So instead of having a single key or instead of trying, it relies on third parties running these things called

[01:03:00] Recovery servers. Right now, vibrant, which is a wallet that sort of is, facilitates usd savings. At the moment, mostly that relies. That uses two recovery servers to implement sub 30. But if other people in the ecosystem wanted to start implementing sub 30 in their wallets- this specific key recovery method- we would need to, as an ecosystem, get people to run these things- recovery servers, right? Recovery servers, which are sort of the servers that you delegate to allow a user to access their account if they lose their key. So, short answer: SEP 30 is implemented in one wallet and could be in more if we set up recovery servers that people could use- and by we I mean the ecosystem as a whole- having to add one point. So this idea that I mentioned about having trust lines for focus for not custodians but for key recovery people- the major change that it would add- sorry, my microphone brother-

[01:04:00] The major change that it would add to the current solution, is that the current solution, if you add it as a signer, like in SEP 30, then you are always getting the other rights as well, so you can always like jointly transfer funds and stuff like that. Having these kind of recovery service at the protocol level, then it would really be just okay. I'm adding those people and they can give me a process to recover my keys, but they can never do payments, transactions, even if they are colluding or jointly hacked, those kind of stuff, and that would put a lot of clearance on the legal side and it would make this, the entire setup, a lot easier. You don't have to store keys online and things like that. So just clarify that. Yeah, I know that we don't have like a lot of time left, but I think it's interesting to keep the conversation going, especially because I think the multiplexed accounts can offer- actually widely adopted- some level of obfuscation to the payments if, like, people start using it, because, as lee said, like people can use them, as

[01:05:00] You know, like as dynamic debit card numbers and it's interesting if the entire ecosystem adopts it, then, like people would be sending money over with different m accounts and that will, like obvious, scale a lot of the information which is really interesting. Yeah, well, it sounds like on both fronts, both on kind of SEP 30s, key recovery design and muxed accounts on the [CAP-27](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) side, we have a lot of thinking to do. I think, you know, as we kind of said in the beginning, this is the beginning of these conversations, or maybe the middle. I guess they've been going on for a while, so we'll definitely be continuing them. So with that I would say, you know, I think it's time to wrap up the discussion today, but I think it's likely we may want- to all meet back here in a few months, certainly after Meridian, and continue this conversation, hopefully making

[01:06:00] Some progress in the time between. So you know again, christian, mind hard, marco, we can't thank you enough for your time today and for sharing your perspective and I hope everyone has a wonderful halloween weekend and we'll talk again soon. Thanks everybody.
