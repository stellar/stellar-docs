This session introduces the redesigned Stellar Community Fund and explains why the program evolved after multiple rounds of community feedback. The update separates funding into two tracks so that smaller experimental efforts and larger, long-lived projects can each receive support that better matches their scope and needs.

The discussion also covers changes to how projects are selected and funded. A panel of experienced community members reviews submissions and advances finalists, after which the wider community allocates funding using quadratic voting. This structure is intended to better reflect voter sentiment, reduce fatigue, and improve fairness as participation scales.

### Key Topics

- The mandate behind the Stellar Community Fund and its evolution from earlier grant programs.
- Differences between the Lab Fund and Seed Fund, including cadence and funding size.
- Why a panel-of-judges stage helps improve finalist quality and scale community voting.
- How quadratic voting captures intensity of preference rather than simple up-or-down votes.
- The use of flagging to help surface potential anomalies for reviewer attention.
- An overview of the new submission and voting experience.

[00:00] Does that mean we're actually live? It's likely. Okay, would you like to take it away for us? No, dude, you go ahead and intro. All right, welcome

[01:00] Everyone. It is fantastic to be live once again with my good buddy colton. We're to be talking about Stellar community funding. We've talked about this in the past, but it was kind of looking forward to a future date when it would actually all go live and lo and behold That day has finally arrived. And so scf 2 0 after many months of planning and building, the ecosystem team is finally ready to release scf 2 0 and that's what we're going to be talking about today. This is engineering talk, so we will get into the weeds a little bit on some of the technical decisions and implementations that we have in this new version of the Stellar community fund. But it's also going to be a bit longer than normal engineering talks, so normally in journey talks for like 15, 20 minutes. This will probably go a little bit longer than that to make sure we do justice to all the updates and have all

[02:00] The information available to those who are interested in this update to the Stellar community fund. So I've got my fancy slide deck open here and we're just gonna start walking straight through this. I think it's worth taking a little bit of a look back as well as the look ahead to kind of see where we've come from and to understand a little bit better why, as well as where we're going. So to kind of inform our discussion here, let's look at our mandate. So the Stellar has a mandate and the SDF is aiming to follow that. This is something we make public and if you just type in google Stellar mandate, you can find this particular quote somewhere buried in there with all the other missions and visions and mandates that we follow at the SDF when building Stellar, the Stellar community fund. So one of our allocations of lumens is dedicated towards the Stellar community fund, this community funding initiative, and it gives the broader Stellar community the opportunity to vote on which projects deserve excellent

[03:00] Grants. This is a very unique fund in that it is the only one that really gives the greater community a direct opportunity to impact the allocation of XLM grants. The SDF has a pool of lumens that it has mandated to give out in certain scenarios and to certain entities to accomplish specific goals and tasks, and one of those is this pool of lumens- 12 million lumens a year- that we give out via the community so the community can take part in allocating those. And that's kind of what we're doing with this big update: is to get closer and continue to iterate on what we've done in the past to align with this goal, this mandate, as well as getting closer. So we've been close to it, but as the ecosystem matures, we need to continuously update and make sure that we're aligned with our mandate, So a little bit of history. The Stellar community fund- I would

[04:00] Stellar community fund. I would lump it together with the Stellar build challenge. So way back in June 2016, the SDF released a project called the Stellar build challenge and the first place winner of that they had a different categories and different, you know, first place, second first, second and third place, and first place was going to win 55 million limbs. The price of lumens back at that time was actually less than a penny. So we've come a long way since June 2016. Entries in that very first Stellar bill challenge included galactic talk and Lobstr, amongst others, so two projects that we- at least I know I- use just about every single day. And then we move all the way through September 2018 to the last spc. So the Stellar build challenge was shut down at the number seven and then, shortly after that, zach- who hopefully a lot of you in this community know- the hero really of the sbc kind of- took over ownership of that and then

[05:00] Transitioned. Or, as the spc went out, he brought back in what we call the Stellar community fund, which was really starting to align more closely with the community vision of the mandate to have the community giving away. These lumens are allocating where those 12 million lumens should go, and so that was carried out by zach. He built it, designed it. We've been running that for a little over a year now, five different rounds, and now we find ourselves here, August 2020, with the scf 2 0 and these different sbcs and scf. Like they were all good and they all worked well in their time. There may have been things that would could have been improved or changed, but we did that right. So, as things can be better, we make efforts to improve them, and that's really what the scf 2 0 is trying to do, and it's making maybe a little bit bigger stab, an improvement, something maybe akin to what zack did when he

[06:00] Initially created or invented the scf, the original scf. We're kind of taking a big step at that. So, rather than just adjusting some rules, we're actually restructuring it in a pretty significant way, taking the best of both the spc and the scf into a new fund which we hope will provide a fantastic funding mechanism for a long time yet. Before you keep going- I do think it's worth highlighting the original, the very first round of scf. Do you remember how voting took place? I do yes. The very original round of sef. We did a vote in a reddit thread where people just like typed in their preferences or their votes and we had to like, hand count them. Zack hand counted them and I hand counted them. And then a community member came up with a script to help count them, so we were like manually counting comments in a reddit thread. So even scf 1 0 has come a long way since the very first iteration. Yeah, that's exactly right. We're always

[07:00] Trying to iterate and a lot of it again like it's not that something was bad and we're trying to make it good. It's that as the ecosystem matures, we have more members, more participants and interest grows. Necessarily the fund itself needs to change to better suit and host the kind of growth that we're seeing. A little bit of a fun fact- the spc and scf is actually where I came from. My intro to Stellar came from the sbc with entries like popcorn, color glyph and Stellar ql, and then in the scf I had Stellar auth and I think so one of the big focuses for me is I've thought about the redesign of an scf and like where can we actually make important and meaningful changes is to like the funding. Obviously, a big focus of that is the funding right, the actual money that's handed out, but Stellar community funding is as much about people and relationships as it is about giving money away. If you

[08:00] Talk to winners or participants that really took the scf or sbcs seriously, a large majority will say that the relationships and feedback that they received were actually more valuable than the money that they received. The money is obviously helpful and that's why you're here, but a huge part of participating in this is also the relationships and the actual community aspect. So sure, it's funding, yes, it's Stellar, but the community aspect is more than just the world can vote. It's also the world can participate. Anybody who's interested in still, anybody wants to talk about fintech and finance and moving money around and transferring value, anybody that's interesting to they can participate and talk and give feedback and find projects that are interesting to them and find their place to communicate- whether that's competing: actually submitting entries, writing documents, you know, submitting with events or documentation or actual

[09:00] Projects, or just combing through entries and seeing which ones you feel like are valuable and interesting and something that should actually receive funding. It's a community fund and being able to focus a bit more on that aspect is something that was really important to me in the redesign of the sef is- yes, the funds are great and we need to make sure we do the best job possible of allocating those appropriately. But a community is a huge part of this. So making sure the people are still at the center. So if I were to summarize kind of the driving principle behind the redesign, for me it's the right resources in the right hands at the right time, resources being funds as well as feedback. Right hands being making sure that we're getting these to actual projects, making sure the filtering process by which entries come in and then get funding that flow makes sense, that nobody's being overworked in the review process that there's this little angst and struggle.

[10:00] I mean it is a competition, so you're. going to have some of that- but combing down on the unnecessary pieces of that and then, at the right time, so making sure that our funds reflect the amount of money for the time that the project has spent on it and the amount of effort that's gone in. So this to me is really kind of the driving force behind the theme of the redesign. And so, with that, those who aren't familiar with the scf: currently it's a single fund that happens four times a year, where three million lumens are given out, split between eight different projects. In this new scf 2 0 there are two funds: there's a lab fund and a seed fund, the lab fund being the smaller experimental kind of open source focused documentation events, the idea of, like seo, market presence, getting the word out there as well as real world's real world stress tests. So building things that maybe aren't necessarily perfect for the Stellar use

[11:00] Case as it stands but might help stress test the network. That would be our lab fund and that is 500 000 lumens given out four times per year, split between about 12 different projects. And then we have the seed fund is for bigger projects. This is to help viable, innovative first mover businesses and utilities to get started on Stellar. These are projects that we hope will still be around in the prize pool, for that is five million lumens split between three to five projects, and that seed fund will happen twice a year. And so by splitting these funds I mean what we see right now in the scf is these two different kinds of entries- larger projects as well as, like hackathon type projects, and they're both very valuable to the ecosystem. Both can generate a lot of excitement. The problem is, right now they both receive about the same amount of funding. Where a lab fund, a hackathon project, really it's worth doing it, it's worth competing for

[12:00] A much lower price, and so you'd still be willing to participate, whereas in the seed fund, if you don't get enough funding, it's really hard to keep that project alive and keep it going. And so by splitting this up into two very specific and defined funds, hopefully you'll know better which one your project fits into- and then you receive the funding that's appropriate, more appropriate for the kind of project that you have. I will say that this necessarily means that we also have to introduce a brand new component- really two components, but maybe one's more of an update. But we need to introduce the idea of panel of judges as well as an update to our voting mechanism. So we have a voting mechanism right now and we technically have a panel of judges, but right now it's the whole wide world, it's the whole community. And so let's say we have 20 entries that come in. How do we narrow that down to like a final entry, say, with 300 entries come in? How do we narrow that down

[13:00] To some sort of manageable list that a final voting round can happen, where a reasonable amount of funds can be allocated and there's not a lot of voter fatigue with having to comb through 300 different entries. The problem right now is that the community- the same community technically- will vote in both of those. So you're voting once, you're picking all the projects, you're combing through lots of entries and then you kind of have to do a whole thing over again in the final round. So you narrow down and then you have a final vote to allocate funds in this new scf 2 0 we're removing, or really splitting that, so there'll be a panel of judges which is a very select group of community members who have dedicated a lot of time and effort and energy into Stellar, building on Stellar, so they maybe have won spcs or scfs in the past. They might be part of the infrastructure grants or the enterprise fund- people that are really core to the Stellar ecosystem, as well as a few SDF

[14:00] Employees like myself, colton, zack, anka and others, and then those the role of the panel of judges will be to filter through all of the entries that come in for either the seed of the lab fund, and narrow that down to a final list that they feel is of highest quality and then those finalists will make it into the community round voting, which is this flaggable quadratic voting, and with this we're really trying to add velocity or add sentiment to a community vote. Right now it's very one sided where- or at least it's very static, where when you have a vote you can say I like this project, and this project. There's no intensity, you can't say I really like this project, or I kind of like this project, or even I really don't like this project. All of those sentiments are quite important to ensuring that the actual amount of lumens, the voting power, allows the sentiment or that curve to most closely represent the actual community sentiment that's participating in that voting round, and

[15:00] We're hoping that through this flaggable quadratic voting that we can achieve that. This is kind of more of the technical aspect of this talk, and colton is actually he's the one who sold me on the idea of quadratic voting and I'm going to hand it over to him for a little bit. I'm going to bring up a screen here with a demo of quadratic voting and then just kind of let him explain where we stumbled upon quadratic voting, how we've implemented ourselves and why we think it's worth trying. Yeah, so we kind of came across quadratic voting when looking at how the sort of Ethereum ecosystem handles funding. In particular a project on Ethereum called git coin. They have this sort of funding mechanism called quadratic funding, which is another flavor of sort of quadratic voting where basically they allow a group of people to make donations to a project. You basically take this square root

[16:00] Of each project or each donation you like, add them all together and then you square that and you kind of get a matching number for that poll of donations. And so we kind of borrowed from that idea and took the sort of original iteration of quadratic funding, which is ultimately quadratic voting. And, like Tyler was saying, this idea of quadratic voting allows you to specify intensity towards your preference of a boat. So in a traditional voting system where it's just one person, one boat, you have this problem where when you're voting for multiple projects you can't express how positively or negatively you feel about that project. And we thought, you know what, since we're doing this community boat. We want experts in the community to be able to double down on projects they really like. We want people who are avid users of a project to double down on projects they really like. But we also want people to be able to give super valid opinions about projects they really like. So if they think something is over performing,

[17:00] Then they can also downvote that project, which I think Tyler will show in this demo here. So I'll kind of let you show how it works and it's much more intuitive once you kind of start clicking around and get a feel for how the voting mechanism works. But we have a better explainer on the website and we also have some resources we can provide for anybody who wants to sort of hear it out or learn more about it. Yeah, absolutely yep, and I think it's worth mentioning too, like this is an experiment in a sense, because I mean colin remind you every single time that like we're trying this, I think it's gonna be fantastic, we'll see. That's the beauty of the scf is we get to iterate and make improvements and really see what works and what doesn't. But to kind of go through a demo here, ultimately there's a prize pool right. So you've got an amount of money that's being allocated by percentage vote. So as votes are given for or against a project, their percentage compared to other projects changes and that necessarily means the amount of prize money

[18:00] That they're winning changes. And this is something that we really want to highlight in the new voting design which, by the way, this is a demo. This isn't actually what the voting site looks like, but this is a good demo, very clean, and I hope it will help kind of allow you to play around with what you have in quadratic voting. But as you have, like, let's say, we really like this unbranded wooden soap project and we would like to give it some votes, we would like to say I like this project. If you give it a single vote, you'll see right here, by that, by adding a single vote, you're going to give it 27 69 and so that is going to increase this number by that 27. To get us to this number you've added 27 69 but that 2769 has to come from somewhere and it came from all these other projects- 227 from here, 30 bucks and two pennies from this project and like that's how you can kind of upvote, download, you can sort of take money from other projects and allocate it here. But it's important

[19:00] To understand that's what's happening. As you start to add votes to a project, really you start with this number of credits and then, as you vote, those credits are burnt and the quadratic, the scaling part of this happens is you start to upvote or downvote a particular project multiple times. So if I click this again, it's going to be two votes, but two times two is four and so it's going to burn four credits. So we voted twice but we've burned four credits. So what that means is, as you start to click on this project more. We voted five times. But five times five is 25, so we've burned 25 credits voting for this project five times. If we start voting for other projects, let's say I also really like this refined cotton shoes. I'm a big cotton shoes fan myself. We don't want this project to lose its 27 76 so we need to make sure we get that back up. And so we're going to start to add a little bit of money back to this project so that this one comes up. And so we've added 661 to this and 24. Now, we haven't necessarily like

[20:00] It's still coming from the same pool, it's just allocating from all these other ones, taking money from those projects and putting it back in there. But you can, in real time, start to see how your votes directly affect the outcome as it stands, when you're voting and you have these credits that you can start to burn. But instead of it just being static. Five and two: it scales quadratically so that you can't overpower a vote in a particular direction and you allow that sentiment again to translate much more closely to the way that people would actually vote and actually share their sentiment if you were to poll a community. Another thing that I think is really important: again, this is static, this is standard quadratic voting. But you might start to see a problem here, and this is this starts to get into a little bit of the issues that you find when you are giving away money in the public is manipulation and there's lots you can do. When you're registering accounts, like

[21:00] You make sure you have accounts that are voting, are using a system that's not free to create, like in our system, we're using SMS verification, so you have to have a phone that can receive SMS messages to be able to vote. In the past, we've used key base, which has some ability to find who's voting, to decide, like to make a decision on whether or not you believe them to be a legitimate individual, human being that doesn't have a lot of copies of themselves in the database. That's voting. But manipulation out in the public is quite difficult to do. In the sbc right, we just had a panel of judges that would pick the projects who we were sure were. We knew who they were. But when you open that up and you say, well, let's open this up to a real community vote, it's great. Until the word starts to get out and you start to see, wow, we can actually win a lot of money and the manipulation becomes much more worth it. And if you don't increase the friction, if you don't add a layer of friction, then that manipulation will just start to scale. And that's really what we've seen in the past, particularly two scfs,

[22:00] Four and five, and really strongly in five. You can go back and read our post mortem on scf5, where voter manipulation just kind of blew out of control. And we knew this was going to be the case because we were using key base and it's free to create a key base account. and so once people start to get the word like I'll just create a free key base account, start using that to vote, and so you have to find ways to counteract that. And so, circling all the way back to quadratic voting, it's not enough to just allow kind of sentiment changes. You also need the ability to sort of flag things. so if a particular project is way over performing or underperforming what you believe they should like- let's say this project down here, well, let's say a refined granite chair- just it's taking off. We like this, is they? Their website doesn't even work. Why is this project doing so well? You might be tempted to use all of your credits, right, 10 times- 10 is 100 credits to burn- and try and get them down from where you believe you know they

[23:00] Shouldn't get this much, like they don't have anything. Why are they getting this much? But the problem is, by downvoting them 10 times, you haven't really affected the vote at all. You've just tried to counteract the bad acting that they, that you believe that they're doing, and so a better alternative is adding this idea of flaggable quadratic voting where, rather than using all your credits to counteract a bad actor, you just put a sentiment, so I want it to go up. I feel like this is under performing, like somebody's attacking this project and down voting it, and they shouldn't. And then I'm going to use 16 credits, in this case, to add a flag that basically just says: hey, moderators, can you please take a look at this? Something's fishy, and you could also go in the other direction too. You say this is way over performing. I think somebody needs to take a look at this. The panel needs to take another look. Something's fishy with this. But now you've only burned a few credits to make that flag and you still have, in this case, 83 left to just carry about your normal business of upvoting and down voting other projects as you please. So, rather than having to spend

[24:00] All of your credits on counteracting bad actors, you can just flag it, the panel will take a look at it and you don't have to worry about it anymore. You can carry on with your vote. I think that's really important in the iteration process of figuring out the best way to have an open community fund where you are giving away a relative relatively large amount of money and manipulation is going to happen. It's just how do we counteract that and how do we allow the community to take part in fighting against that, so that the fund is the easiest, the lowest friction, but also incredibly fair and well run. And as time goes on, we'll see how this works and we'll make changes as necessary. Yeah, and we have a couple questions coming in about this. So one of them is: can you recast votes? And the answer is yes, until you like submit your final vote right, so you'll be able to kind of dynamically adjust your votes however you want throughout the system. So say, you upvoted one or two projects and you decide to change your mind

[25:00] Before you submit, you'll be able to do that like it's not set in stone until, yeah, it's not click submit. That's a really good question. It's something I've kind of gone back and forth on. Could you like update votes? So there's two kind of problems that I see with that one, if you're able to like update votes, essentially you would make a change and then that changes public to anybody else that's also voting. And in the case of a bad actor you could create a bunch of fake accounts, really skew up the vote and then kind of reactively go back and change all of that. You know like remove all your votes or update your votes in a particular direction, and now it's not all that helpful and so I don't think being able to update your votes is all that necessary. I think would probably do more damage than it would do good. The issue then obviously is: well, if I, if I'm allocating my funds, but then the project changes significantly, it gets a lot more votes than it did when I voted, then maybe I should just wait to vote to the very last minute, and I think we'll have to see that because I don't really want people to wait until the very last minute to vote. But I don't think in general,

[26:00] But I don't think in general that's going to happen. It's just something we'll have to evaluate and I feel like the way we've done it now is probably the best way to start and then we just have to see what happens through the first, like lab and seed funds, and then, if adjustments are needed, either on updates or like the frequency that you can make updates or I don't know there's different parameters you can add. That might help with some of the pros and cons of either one of those options. Yeah, I don't think retro, like going back and changing a vote after you submit, it will really ever be like a viable option, but you'll be able to do it before you submit the other one. Are there any features built in to prevent flag spamming? Not, I don't think, not in the UI or anything like that. There's nothing to prevent it. Like, ultimately, if people flag spam, that doesn't guarantee that a project will be disqualified or anything like that. It's more of just like a: hey, you guys really need to take a look at this. So if there's one particular like, say, one project gets one flag response, it probably won't get looked at. But if it gets 20 flag responses, then it'll probably end up getting looked at. And if somebody is just flag spamming

[27:00] And there's no obvious manipulation taking place and they just won't be disqualified or anything like that, yeah, and that's a. It's a really good question and I think hopefully a good answer to that is that flags don't actually affect the prize allocation. It's just a flag. You have to spend credits to flag things, so you can't flag every project. You can only flag up to one, less than half, or I think maybe one more than half of the projects when you're actually making a flag. But flags don't count for a positive or a negative when it comes to the final prize allocation. It's just like, hey, take a look at this, one vote will count towards a positive, and so you can add more positivity if you're like: well, if this doesn't get improved, I want to make sure that they get something. Like you could do that, but at the end of the day, the flag doesn't really do anything as far as changing the vote. Like, nobody else is going to see projects that have been flagged. It's just a note to the panels, to the jud, the panel of judges for that round, that something might be fishy and somebody needs to take a look at this

[28:00] Entry. All right, let me double check, make sure I did not miss anything. Okay, I think we're good on, like, the specifics of quadratic voting the other did we touch on why we think like linear distribution is not ideal and we did not call them. Would you like to wax eloquently? Sure, let's talk about linear distributions. So one of the big pro you know, and we call it a problem. But it's easy to say this in hindsight. But one of the big problems we identified with the current model of scf is that the distribution of funds is really linear, right like if you look at it on a graph, it looks like something like that. But the big problem with that is that the complexity of any given project in a round can be very different. So, like a project that gets second place and one round could be like a full on business and the project that gets second place and another round could be like a hackathon project. And if you have this linear distribution of funds, that means those two projects got the same amount of money

[29:00] Just based on which round they submitted. This isn't ideal, obviously, because those projects are of varying quality. They need different amounts of money to scale up properly. So we had a. The reason we consider quadratic voting is that the community can kind of decide: okay, look, this project is it needs way more money than the project next to it in the competition, and so we can allocate our votes proportionately and get them more money. In the current voting system you just literally can't do that. So we wanted it to be more dynamic. Somebody just asked another question. Sorry that distracted me anyway. So we wanted the allocation of funds to be more dynamic, to be able to fit the needs of the projects who were submitted and allow the community to fit those needs with their vote as well. Yeah, yep, absolutely, and I think like a linear. When you don't have a quadratic system or you don't have a panel of judges, you have to be really careful with how you allow votes to be allocated, because it would be really easy for

[30:00] The wrong project to receive a ridiculous amount of money through manipulation. And so you kind of counteract some of the manipulation by not allowing a project to vote for themselves three times or only, and so you enforce like okay. And in the final round, for example, right now, you have to vote for three projects. You can't just vote for yourself, and that's really important, because if there is a project that's kind of running away with the vote, they still have to allocate two of their percentages: they're 33, 66, 70 percent of their vote has to go to other projects. But that necessarily means that the projection of votes, or the distribution of votes, is going to be linear, because you don't have a lot of influence over a really strong opinion in one way or another. And so once you have both a panel of judges that ensures the finalists list is always high quality, you have quadratic voting, which allows individuals to very strongly point in the direction that they want. But also, if you vote exclusively on one project, you only have

[31:00] 10 votes, whereas if you spread it out, you have up, to like 100 votes. Like you can really spread that out, your influence out over a large range of projects, if you want to, and so the ability to manipulate, even without the other features that we have built in through SMS messaging and kind of the improvement that is over key base, that's already better, and so once you add on top of it the SMS verification, hopefully again the theory is that we'll have a much more dynamic voting mechan mechanism that will better reflect the actual entries in a particular round, rather than just kind of always being linear- yeah for sure, and like even you know if it, even if it ends up being a problem where, like, we have first place, always wait out performing, or something like that, you can always tweet quadratic voting, like, for example, you can remove one of the, you can reduce the credits from 100 to 99 and all of a sudden, in order to vote,

[32:00] That requires you to distribute your tokens across, I think, three projects, or something like that, to use all of them. So you can make small tweets like that and it can have, you know, big effects. So if there comes a time where it feels like we need to make changes like that. We can easily do so. One of the projects that came up was or not projects questions was: will we be able to engage judges ahead of time to address any concerns they may have regarding technical feasibility or other issues? Yeah, fantastic question. Absolutely you will. The panel of judges is probably going to be about 10 individuals per round and there'll be a lot of discussion back and forth on the projects that they feel the panel feels our potential for finalists and there's still some like the panels, like we're going to have to figure it out how the judging actually works. Like if you only have to go through 20 projects, 30 projects, that's pretty, that's relatively easy to do and to give a bit more hands on experience for every single entry, whereas if you have 500- which I think our last spc had, something,

[33:00] Which I think our last spc had, something like 500 entries, not everybody's going to be able to be reached out to and so there'll be a little bit of back and forth and you need to make sure that your entry is really strong and really solid and you don't feel like there should be a whole lot of back and forth because what you've put out there is really good. You need to put your best foot forward and really make an impression and make it a proven and not assume that if I put something out there, that's kind of half hearted that it still has a chance because someone will reach out to me that may or may not be the case. So I would always encourage entrants to really put maximum effort that they feel is worth it for them into their entry and then, as the panelists go through the entries, hopefully you get someone to kind of adopt your project and start reaching out and kind of provide some of that relationship and that feedback. And if not, the community is always available. Like there's a ton of people out there that are never going to be on a panel, but that can still provide feedback for your project and help you improve it, so that when it does come time for the next lab fund or a seed fund, your project's even stronger.

[34:00] But it will be important to kind of serve yourself first in this competition, particularly as we start, we continue to grow and have more entries to not assume too much of our panelists but to make it as easy as possible for them to recognize that your project is insane, that it's amazing and it deserves a little bit of a longer look in the same way that you would make a pitch to any other fund, any other funding opportunity. Really make that strong sort of elevator pitch, if you will. Yeah, and somebody asks if the quadratic voting demo is on GitHub or if it'll be on GitHub later. It might be, I can make sure we put that up for sure. Yeah, it would be good for other people to look through that. You can obviously play around with it at fqv versal app but I'll make sure I have the code available for review and tweaking- sweet. And then somebody said if a project is very ambitious,

[35:00] Its product has to be way more advanced than others, because people can sell the idea that they need way more funds when this is not true. Yeah, of course I mean that's kind of the nature of like a competition. Right, you have to sell people on your vision and what you're building anyway. And if somebody does a better job of selling the fact that they might need more funding or something like that, and the community supports it and wants to get behind it, that's, you know, more power to those people, right, like they've done a good job of pitching the community. And it can also be the case that a project very obviously needs way more funding, but they do a way worse job of pitching their idea to the community and they won't receive as much funding. That's kind of like an inherent feature of competitions rather than like some problem that you can kind of easily solve outside of having you know one entity pick where money should go. Yeah, I think it's worth speaking to that a little bit, particularly as somebody myself who competed in both the spc and the scf. It's not crazy easy. It isn't easy to win these competitions.

[36:00] But if you treat it serious and you treat it for the fun that it is and really put your heart and soul not just into the code and into your idea and kind of- I don't know attaching yourself personally- to your project, but kind of saying that this is a community effort. I want to make something that's valuable to other people. That necessarily like, if that's a priority of yours, to make something that other people care about, necessarily that means you're going to promote it, you're going to talk about it because you want people to use it, you want it to improve their lives. If you're just making something that's fun and you don't really care if people interact with it or benefit from it, again that might be a really good lab fund entry, but you're still going to need to get people's eyeballs on it and some buzz around it and that can be a little bit challenging, I think, as developers, to like think about how do I promote this thing? I just want to code it and I understand that challenge. But it also gives you that opportunity to kind of get a leg up on other developers or entrants that aren't willing to do that and

[37:00] Like we want projects to win, not just because they did a good job, but because other people are going to use the project that they're building and see the value and get it. if you build something amazing but nobody knows about it, that's kind of sad, that's unfortunate, and I'd like to see amazing projects get visibility and I want to help with that as well, as you taking that effort and putting it out there. But it's both of us- the actual fund itself putting facetime on to the projects that are highest quality and putting the most effort in, as well as you really selling that and saying that I've built something and it's amazing and here's why doing blog posts and putting a little bit of good care into the design, the actual UI and ux. Thinking through, what would it be like to judge this project and how can I improve that? Making sure that they're a good demo username and password available if your project has a login barrier, like simple things like that- a video explainer showcasing your team putting your face on a camera, like those things can really go a long way.

[38:00] And that's not. It's not like the scf's the only fund. That's like that. Anywhere you try and get funding, anywhere that it's a competition. That's going to be true, that those who put the most effort into communicating and selling their project, they're going to do the best, particularly if they've spent a lot of time actually making their project good. Right, like you don't want to promote something that really isn't all that great. But if you have both of those things together, like maybe skip a round of lab fund and really dive into having both of those pieces- a really good project and really good blog posts- and combining both of those things together to really give yourself the best chance at succeeding in the lab or in the seed fund. Yeah, and it is worth noting, like I think, going forward in different rounds of seo, if we're going to do a, really we're going to try to do a really good job of like highlighting what made projects successful in any given round, that way, like everybody can kind of learn from each other and there's not this like black hole of you trying to figure out

[39:00] You know what do I need to do to. perform well in scf. I think we're going to try to do a way better job of getting that information out there so everybody can kind of learn from each other and it makes the competition, you know, better for everybody. Yeah, absolutely, yep, some blog posts on how to place well in the scf- you know what are judges looking for- like again adding the relationship piece and putting a little bit more focus on that. I think treating the scf like it's a thing, rather than kind of just a something that's also going on somewhere out there. You know, good luck, as it's kind of been a little bit in the past, trying to focus a little bit more on this is really important to the ecosystem and building up the resources and the marketing and the communication relationship aspect of the seller community fund so that it just provides that really strong opportunity to get funding and recognition for the work that you're doing instead and really incentivize you to want to build on seller and to give you the right route to succeed,

[40:00] Whether that's through funding, relationships building. You know, going from the lab fund to the seed fund, from something fun to a business like there's a lot of different tracks that individuals can take, but really making like, highlighting those and helping people along and including the community in that. So it's not just me and colton trying to do everything, but that the community knows where they can get involved and where the gaps are that need to be filled so that this thing can really take on a much stronger community sense, and finding where that is where that's needed and where it can best fit as the fund again continues to mature. As it has been sweet, I think we're caught up on questions so we can move on in the presentation. All right, super duper, not too much further to go. Appreciate everyone for the fantastic questions. These are obviously two very important components that really highlight the difference between what we have right now and what we're launching today, so kind of. In conclusion, two key takeaways:

[41:00] The SDF funds projects and so if you've got a contact- you know, clients or yourself who's looking- either maybe isn't a good fit for the infrastructure again- or the enterprise fund, which we also have, but are strictly SDF managed, refer them to the scf. You know, point people towards us, get yourself involved, whether as a judge or as a participant. With a split between the lab and the seed funds, we have a strong funding avenue for more mature and serious entrepreneurs while still providing a profitable playground for new and curious developers. So we've really got that platform that's going to support a much wider ecosystem in a much more effective way. So we fund projects, but you can also help- and I cannot emphasize this enough- like we get you know this is a Stellar fund. We get that it's a fund, but let's really take some time thinking about the community aspect of this. To get involved, join the seller dot community fund

[42:00] Key base group. I would highly encourage that. if this is something that's interesting to you- whether the design of the fund itself, the participation as a voter, or your got questions about the entry, how to enter, or you know anything related- this is kind of where the community is going to talk about this other community fund. So make sure you jump into Stellar community fund and then also make sure you participate in community discussion, whether that's on key base or in different discussion groups, as well as the voting phases. So when voting comes out, participate, get involved, you know, spend those credits, put them where you think they should go and then also help to share the story of solid entries, as well as referring those potential participants. So, as you have social media accounts and you want to get the word out of projects that you care about that. You I mean if you've put credits toward them, share their story, like, get them out there so that they can not just receive funding from the SDF but they can actually

[43:00] Get involvement from the greater community. Maybe they come back and participate in another lab fund with new improvements and you're starting to invest and put energy towards people and not just projects, and really want to see individual developers and contributors, creators, succeed, whether that's in a particular project or across multiple entries. Starting to invest not just in projects but people is something that I'd really like to see coming out of this update. So that's the close. There's no context behind that picture. You get no context. This is inside joke. Now, this is: yeah, thanks for watching before. No. Before we wrap it up, we do need to share the announcement blog post and we need to show the site. That's correct. So you're ahead of yourself, sir. I'm gonna share the announcement blog post right now in the chat. So if people want to head over and read

[44:00] That, it's basically like a nice shareable summary of everything we just said. Fantastic, will you be able to pull up the site? Nice, tada, amazing. So this is the all new. And how convenient. Somebody just asked what the dates are for the first round, so we can go over that fantastic question. But the new site is over at `communityfund.stellar.org` a lot of work has gone into the site over the past- I don't even know how long it's been huge collapse. She, she's a web flow wizard now designed this, built this whole site basically on our own. Unbelievable, incredible, huge props to anka for this incredible site. But yes, the Stellar community fund has a marketing page and it's not just here's the rules, it actually outlines what it is, the two different funds we've got. We got an art. We got a marketing video, what we're big leagues colton. Yeah, I know,

[45:00] I know. But anyways, the website has a breakdown of both the funds it has, you know, a couple step by steps it's got some featured projects. It's got some cool illustrations of little astronauts which are amazing, but each tab on there. So the seed fund tab and the lab fund tab, I believe have not only prize pools but the dates on when they start and a countdown timer. Which one are we on right now? This is the lab fund, okay. So the lab fund actually, I don't know what. The today's date is, August 28th, which technically the lab and the seed fund are open for submissions right now, which I don't know if I would submit today, unless you've just been sitting on an entry, but they're officially both open right now. So you are welcome to begin submitting projects to these brand new lab and seed funds. So the lab fund obviously will close first. It's the shorter fund opens up today. Submissions will close

[46:00] On September 21st. So according to our countdown timer, that gives you about 23 days to submit to our very first lab fund. The community discussion will then- I'm sorry, the panel discussion will begin then on September 21st and go through October 12th, then October 26th, after the community discussion, where the community will kind of go through the entries and ask any follow up questions and have an opportunity to engage in the entries. The community voting will begin. That'll go on for a week as normal on that new flaggable quadratic voting and it all happens right here. So rather than there being galactic talk and the voting page, it's all integrated straight into start. I'm sorry, communityfun stiller org all integrator, right here you can go and log in. If you are an entrant, log in with your phone number and that allows you to enter your project. If you're a panel judge- which there's not too many of you, but if you are a panel judge, panel judges

[47:00] Will log in with their key base account. That's how we differentiate between entrants and panelists- and then you can go through your projects either to enter or to begin the selection. So this is all very obviously brand new, experimental in a sense, but we're very excited. We put a lot of time and effort into this. But as you have questions or feedback, you can reach out on that Stellar community fund key base channel or go to this connect page where we've got a form down the bottom where you can also reach out as you have issues, bug reports, other questions. If you've got partnership opportunities, anything like that, you can reach out through that form. And then just to cover really quick on the seed fund timing, you can check it out yourself. But submissions are open now and those will actually go all the way through January 18- 2021. This is because seed fund projects are big projects. These are not quick. Hey, I've got an idea this weekend. These are big projects. We want to see businesses coming out of this. That will

[48:00] Last a year. So we're putting lots of time available for submitting your idea to the seed fund and then panels will begin selecting those January 18th. That'll go on through till March 15th where the community discussion will begin. That'll go through April 26th and then finally on May 10th the community voting will end. The community voting for this is actually two weeks, but then May 10th, the first seed fund will close out. If you have other questions about the rest of the dates, those are also in another community post that we're putting out. Talking a little bit more about the technical details behind the Stellar community fund: yeah, and if you go through some of the like submission requirements and it's still not clear, please reach out to Tyler or me or anybody else to kind of discuss where your project might fit, whether in the seed fund or the lab fund,

[49:00] And we can definitely have that discussion. And then you know, see which part of those sort of requirements and descriptions were confusing, because it's extremely important that we clearly communicate the separation between the two. Yep, so we've done quite a bit of writing, both on those blog posts to explain the new sef, as well as on these kind of these couple how to articles, as well as the guidelines, rules, the phases in the projects or in the rounds, as well as just a look at previous winners. But as you go through that content, if there are things you feel like we could do better, I mean again, this is a community effort not just in the fund itself but in the actual design of the community fund. So we're would love feedback and improvement ideas, or are the articles that you would find helpful? You can always submit those through that form or just in the key based group to make suggestions. Sweet, and I think we've been going for a long time, so we can wrap this thing up. Yeah, I mean it's, I'm super excited, I'm. I mean, if you can't tell I'm, I've. We've spent so much time on this as someone who used to participate,

[50:00] Like this is the fund I would have. wanted. So I'm so happy and excited to have this live. Can't wait to see what people build, watching, to see how it continues to mature and iterate. I would love to see the community get more wrapped up in the community fund and engaged and have a bit of ownership around what it is and how it operates. So excited to be at a spot where we can finally launch this new thing and really be starting continuing, but starting from a strong place to continue our community fund efforts in aligning with the mandate that we have for this particular allocation of lumens. Sweet thanks everybody. Yep, thanks, guys. As you have questions, again reach out. Otherwise, it's been a lot of fun explaining it, walking through it, and I can't wait to see what you build and hopefully won't be too long before we have another one of these live hangout shows, maybe even next week, Stellar podcast

[51:00] Live next week. There's the plug.
