Denelle Dixon closed day one of Meridian with a candid look at her first six months leading SDF. She described how the nonprofit's distributed staff, community-first mandate, and "convener" role are meant to translate the open-web values she championed at Mozilla into actionable support for anchors, wallets, and ecosystem partners.

She also unveiled the next-decade playbook: new marketing and policy hires, a rebalanced treasury that burned 50B XLM, and an enterprise fund that lets SDF co-build priority use cases while still pushing most ownership to the community. The Q&A drilled into liquidity, regulatory outreach, and SDF's responsibility to make Stellar an inclusive place for women and other underrepresented builders.

Key discussion threads:

- What SDF's nonprofit structure, global team, and governance role mean for builders who want a trustworthy steward for the core protocol.
- How the 50B lumen burn and new ecosystem buckets (operations, enterprise investments, currency support, and user distribution) will put capital to work faster.
- Why the foundation is doubling down on regulatory education, marketing help for ecosystem apps, and more representative voices across Stellar events.
