[Fernando Castillo](https://github.com/fercastdev) shared how [Dob Protocol](https://www.dobprotocol.com) turns infrastructure machines into investable revenue streams while keeping funding transparent and compliant.

Highlights include how:

- LatAm operators upload verifiable data (invoices, device specs, ERP proof) into DoP Token Studio, where automated checks plus human review score each project.
- Smart-contract “splitters” hold USDC inflows and disburse them to supporters on a set cadence, with configurable scopes for vesting, DAO treasuries, or revenue sharing.
- Compliance stays local: hashes of documents land on-chain, while KYC/KYB, AML, and future collateral modules protect supporters from rug pulls and expired proofs.
- Liquidity today targets Stellar and Base, with plans to bridge external capital toward real infrastructure yields.
