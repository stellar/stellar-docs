[Fernando Castillo](https://github.com/fercastdev) shared how [Dob Protocol](https://www.dobprotocol.com) turns infrastructure machines into investable revenue streams while keeping funding transparent and compliant.

Highlights include how:

- LatAm operators upload verifiable data (invoices, device specs, ERP proof) into DoP Token Studio, where automated checks plus human review score each project.
- Smart-contract “splitters” hold USDC inflows and disburse them to supporters on a set cadence, with configurable scopes for vesting, DAO treasuries, or revenue sharing.
- Compliance stays local: hashes of documents land on-chain, while KYC/KYB, AML, and future collateral modules protect supporters from rug pulls and expired proofs.
- Liquidity today targets Stellar and Base, with plans to bridge external capital toward real infrastructure yields.

[00:00] Hi and welcome to this week's Stellar Developer Meeting with me in the studio here. Today I have Fernando from dop protocol and I can't exactly remember. When I heard about dop protocol for the first time. But I do remember I noticed, that my feeds in all social media like LinkedIn X anywhere this company just started to pop up and there was articles and they were going to conferences and I just just got really curious about what's up with these guys what are they doing. So and and of course they were attacking Stellar in everything they were doing being awesome ambassadors. So I started to to read a little bit up on what they're doing and since. Then I've had the pleasure of meeting the the whole team several times last last time actually this week in Silicon Valley where I met Oscar. But met the team also at Meridian many other places. So I think it's a great

[01:00] opportunity to have them here in the studio and and hear what they're up to, what they're doing and and share with the rest of the community. So welcome Fernando and thank you for joining today. Yeah, thank you for the invitation Ken. I'm pleasure to be here. So should I just. Now continue with the presentation? Yeah, maybe maybe just just tell a little bit about who you are, how long time you've been working on protocol. A bit of an introduction. I'm Fernando Castillo. I'm currently the CTO of DOP protocol, one of the co-founders and our main goal. Now with the protocol is to be able to all of the infrastructure, that's not being funded to get funded by decentralized means. And. Now in

[02:00] this presentation hopefully I'm going to show a way on how we can do, that with token studio and with the other tools we've been developing. So first yeah what's the team a bit of also an introduction car and already mentioned Oscar he's our CEO he's currently at Silicon Valley doing the embark pro program with Deron University in conjunction with Stellar also we have Simone Spinola who's our operation and business officer and myself as I said already and also as a side note I'm finishing my PhD until Berlin. Now I'm in Germany currently. So it's a bit late for me. Now it's 10

[03:00] p.m. But I'm happy to be here and yeah. So what's the the problem, that we are facing is, that in Latin America there are a lot of infrastructure operators, that are lacking fund and they struggle to to scale. Because on traditional banking systems the they require to go to to ask to the bank to. Then request for a loan. Then go through all the bureaucracy of the bank. But. Then also time moves and they need the the money to deploy and to create this new infrastructure, that is not risky by itself. But maybe the banks consider is risky. Because of the type of size of the company maybe or the type of emerging market. So it's. But it's not, that the business business itself of, that infrastructure is non

[04:00] investable or, that it will give money returns. So as I was saying let's imagine, that you are Mariano you are trying to get a traditional credit a loan for for a bank. But this depending on the country also for example we've recently seen in Argentina how this country was facing high inflation rates or similar situation with Venezuela and other countries in Latin America with high inflation rates, that. Then this ties those loans to higher interest rates plus the the risk on the country itself. So there's this problem of banks. Because of these situations not giving beneficial loans to to these infrastructure operators and at the same time. If the

[05:00] infrastructure operator would go for example for a crowdfunding or a regular crowdfunding solution where they could go online. And then they could say okay let's get all of these people request this this this amount of money. I don't know, let's ask for $100,000. So we can build this power grid based on on solar power. Then how. Then this operator could return or distribute the revenue, that this energy production is generating? And how could they do it in a trust trustworthy fashion. So all of the people, that were investing or supporting the project can can give the the the money back or the investment. And just as a

[06:00] parenthesis latam infra operators are Latin American infrastructure operators. They are for example medium to small companies, that have this infrastructure projects. For example, a small or not. So small. But maybe a few kilowatts or 100 kilowatts of power into injecting into the energy grid. For example, a solar base or holic or there could be other type of infrastructure for example a data center or any type of infrastructure, that's not relying on a big company. Because big companies they wouldn't have this type of problem to to access credits or loans from banks. So in our or what are we proposing as a solution we have this separated in

[07:00] four steps. One is to provide a tool for the operator to hand out verifiable data from their existing company or projects. So they can for example validate okay this solar solar cell is going to produce this amount of energy. Because it has this specifications. I can I have already bought them for this price or I have this revenue evidence for similar infrastructure pictures or proof of location for example for where is it installed the the infrastructure and, that that's the first part of okay how can we give some some due diligence for example, that's the same thing, that the bank would go. When when this person goes to the bank. Okay,

[08:00] show me the papers. How can I know, that you are not going to ask for the money for an an madeup project. But it's a real project and you're a real company, that was not just created yesterday. Then all of this information is naturally audited and revised by by automated process, that are human le. What does, that mean? It means, that we check for example okay this is a receipt. But it has a digital signature. So it's not, that this invoice for example you get from from another company paying for your service or for your infrastructure is is making this up. But at least it's on on the record it's on the ledger of the tax offices for example or or the corresponding

[09:00] corresponding regulatory office in charge of of invoice. And then so they they cannot be made up and the same with the revenues or how other distribution processes have been made. And. Then so and the third part is okay how can we. Then get this decentralized funding into the hands of Mariano the one, that was asking for the funding. So for this is where we have the smart contracts, that take care of this operation where the supporters for the project can support Mariano's infrastructure project. And then he can gets the fund to install or do the setup for their project. Then the same once

[10:00] Mariano needs or is going to pay back with the corresponding interest to their supporters. Then the smart contract also takes care of, that with a decentralized distribution, that's transparent and it's auditable for all of the stakeholders. And this is currently on a suite, that we're calling DO token studio. There basically we have two two types of users. Now we're thinking of a third user. But the two main users of you probably have noticed already are the infrastructure operator and the investor or supporter. On one side the infrastructure operator as I was saying takes care of uploading the information the device information how this is

[11:00] technically behaving how is the type of revenue it's going to generate distributions or revenue distributions every month every week or every quarter or annually. And those are the those sets the expected APR, that the infrastructure operator is offering. Once this is done. Then this goes into the blockchain. So it's it's committed, that okay this is the information we're committed for the posterior auditing. And then as I said this is reviewed the authenticity and the validity of the information maybe maybe you can just have a moment there's there's a couple of questions yes. So yes actually well going for

[12:00] the first question what are latam in front of operator Latin operators are Latin American infrastructure operators. They are the ones, that that want to get funded. RWS and infra are inherently illiquid. How do you address, that? Yes. That's one of the innovation, that we are doing is, that we are not tokenizing maybe, that was one point, that I was missing is, that we are not tokenizing the infrastructure by itself. But what we are focusing is on the revenue this infrastructure is going to to generate and, that comes with a higher risk obviously. But then it balances is the higher risk with the with a higher APR. How do you solve regulatory

[13:00] compliance low issues? Yes, this is I really don't think I will be able to address all of those regulatory compliance issues. But I can say, that. Because of the nature of the project, that as I was saying earlier we are not tokenizing an asset and it itself. But we are working with the future revenue it will produce, that can solve other type of compliance around regulation issues. But also it's important to mention, that this is very local and depending on on on each country finally. So it will it won't be the same for example the same in the US and here in Germany or in Chile okay. Then wait pay is this a loan or is it a revenue participating in the project

[14:00] project Yes. So this can be considered as m multiple things. So in the end is the this revenue for the what the infrastructure generates, that's as I was saying is what's being kind of tokenized. So. But then. If you look at from a different perspective. Then or the traditional perspective this could be taken as alone from the chat file. I see Oscar was as. Now is there I don't know is who review central yes I think, that's those are most of the questions. Then yes this is obviously this is a a regulated service it cannot is not the

[15:00] wild west. But now I will focus mostly on the technological part of how we are addressing these issues. Because for compliance I think we we can take a bit longer to answer all of those questions. Okay. So I'll continue then. So with this we are offering multiple features in this platform, that this we can submit multiple type of evidence. This is based on on the concept of trusts where we are producing evidence for all of the stages and all of the interaction the infrastructure and the operators are generating and producing. What does, that mean? For example. When the operator the first one I mentioned it already, the operator can submit, okay, these are the technical

[16:00] specifications or this is an invoice. But. Then we can get more complex evidence. When we start to aggregate different types of evidence. Because one in invoice alone for example would mean okay you you will receive this payment in the future or you are receiving it. Now but. Then to do the accounting evidence for example for, that we need to connect with the ERP of the business and, that's more complex than just verifying a a single invoice. Then humanoled guided integrity check means, that even, though this project or what we are doing is highly depending on automatization automat automation we still require people in the loop. Personally looked at. So

[17:00] everything goes yes as as I was mentioning earlier on the the accord regulation. Then will rely on the onchain verification module. So all of the transactions especially for the the the stakeholders, that are supporting the project or the infrastructure operator they can see how all of these actions are being verified and chained how they are transparent with the respective proofs. And finally as every project is different all of them will have a different type of scorings for for and with this will represent basically from high risk project to and higher APR and lower risk and lower. Therefore APR

[18:00] and in practical terms how is this the overview of this this smart contracts in particular for the token studio is, that we as the the or the infrastructure operator deploys the the splitter contract and there we have different functions to define the shareholders how are they going to do the withdrawals every how how often are going to be the distribution events and to, which token is this binded regularly we will be working with USDC. But for example this could take other type of tokens. If that's how, that project is defined. But most of most

[19:00] of the time we work with USDC and in in simple terms it's super s I think it's super easy to understand. If there's one chair holder or token holder with the 10%. Then once the distribution take place all of the revenue, that was generated and was deposited in into the smart contract. Then it will go a 10% into the the one, that has a 10% of of the tokens. So on how this distribution flow goes is, that first we have the admin, that communicates to the distri to the splitter contract, that's going to do the distribution what's the token address. Then this is

[20:00] verified inside of the smart contract. Then it verifies. Then check the current balance for example are those Are there 100 tokens to to distribute. And then in each case it's the loop checking on the token holders and the respective balance and and there, that's how it does the calculation and this goes. Then into the storage class where where finish where it's finished with the distribution. It's really straightforward. Then for the withdraw. Then the each shareholder or token holder goes into the the splitter it does the prospective verification check with the storage what's the current allocation. Then decrease on the

[21:00] storage part. Then communicates directly with the token does a transfer with a good successful withdraw. And then it goes again to the threshold and at the storage level this is just just in case I'm presenting it this like this. Because we are currently going under the respective revisions and auditings. So it's it cannot be everything public. I mean this can. But not the code itself yet. And. Then we have the the cher data key, and the allocation data key, which basically defines how is the charge for each data holder, who's the admin, all of the security,

[22:00] what's the allocation for each token holder and. And then how this can be allocated each time the distribution goes. Then here on the security level on how we are defining we are taking this very seriously defining the access control policies admin only function the authentication the lock on contract the transfer contracts also we have our internal scripts for doing the a to have a deployer and do an anatomical operations. So we don't run on front run is front front running. Then we have allocation limits some validations and. And so on. And this as a first case we've presented this to investment of returns

[23:00] for the the investors or supporters of of the project of infrastructure. But this for example could be used as token vesting models over team members on time for similar to the revenue trading for a DAO treasury or for reward distribution. And. Then for the particular the feature, that were missing for before are, that this is a secure and transparent way on how this distribution method is performed. Because all of the transactions are done on chain and, that these transactions are. Then proportional to each one of the supporters. So yes, thank you very much. I hope I didn't pass on time and

[24:00] we we have a few questions. In in the chat I think. Okay. I think the answer yes. So where I was I left is it either alone with interest or is it at your particip Yes. As I said, it's more of a chair participation of the project. I was making the the loan with interest at the beginning to make the analogy with traditional banking settings. Who will review centralized entities? Yes. I mean this needs to go all of the businesses and infrastruct, which are the infrastructure operators in this case goes into a know your business process. Because this has to also go with antimony laundering policy and and all of those regulations. Does, that mean, that the entire review

[25:00] process and due diligence is no the proofs or more than the proofs the the hash of the proofs and the evidence are stored unchanged. Because we cannot just publish yeah accounting states or financial states from companies on chain. Is it really 100% of the project's revenue or is it some Yes. So. When when we consider this there's for the for example the the energy production, that a solar panel is going to to generate it's going let's say it generates 100 dollars per week. Then from this there's a minimal amount, that's defined during the creation of the project, that needs to go by to

[26:00] the operation itself. That could be for example 30% or 20%, that depends on the project. So it's finally on the discounted from the operation then, that's what goes into the what's the distributed how could you manage. Then state expiration. If you are storing hashes on chain do you mean like. If a proof is expired for example I I'm not to, which state do you mean? World matias. Yes. So, that is so. When proofs are verified

[27:00] it it depends on the type of pro proof and there are multiple risk risk. When you verify proofs. Certainly one is for example using old proofs or reusing proofs. Other is just trying to use past evidence as newly evidence. But all of those parts are very part of the ver, that of the offchain verification. And. When the onchain verification happens this proof is has been already through this process. Yes. So currently the guarantees where do I pass this? Ah yeah let me answer this first. Yes. So there's currently

[28:00] a new feature we want to to to do is to actually put some collateral, that can give stakeholders more guarantees. So ina. So we would. Because from the beginning this sounds more like okay we will we could be giving random money to a strangers stranger, that maybe at, that point everything was true. But then still did a rock pole as as you mentioned and and. Therefore we are creating this other collateralization mechanisms but, that's not defined yet. But, that's why also on the first stage of this we are focusing only on companies, that we know, that can give this guarantees and are not a meme company for example. So

[29:00] that's one one really important point. So Stellar asset or so. So. So the tok the the Stellar the artist this token actual Stellar asset or Soroban tokens. So as we as I was saying it's the token, that's distributed is a USDC and how the asset of the token holder is also a token. Because why and why not a regular seller asset. Because we needed to create some extra functions, that were not into the assets. Okay, great. I think you got caught up on all the questions. It's great to see, that there's. So many questions. So much interest in what

[30:00] you guys are doing and how you structure it. So yeah, it was great. If there's no other questions. Then I guess we can stop here. But thank you so much for for joining today. I think it's super interesting to see what you're doing. It's I kind of like these type of projects, that are not not the typical projects we see. It's definitely using using tokens and using the platform in a different way. I think, that's, that's super interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Just let me add there's a last one. Yeah. Yeah. To to answer, that last question. Yes. One of our also our current goals is to bring liquidity from other blockchains in particular from Ethereum based blockchains liquidity and, that's

[31:00] because actually we're not only based on working on Stellar. But we're also working on base and we see this potential from bringing more liquidity to Stellar from base through this infrastructure projects and yes we are taking a look at near intense. Great. Well, thank you for joining everyone and thank you for joining too, Fernando. It was great to to catch up with you and I'm sure I'll see you at events around the world like I have this the past year. Thank you for the invitation. It was a pleasure. Yeah. And and. If anyone else has any questions, I'm sure you can reach out to the team on on Discord. I think one of the things, that's very interesting about this is, that brings up some use cases and some things, that are, that

[32:00] that raises some questions. Because maybe we haven't seen, that before or maybe we're not used to thinking about tokenization in this way or using the platform. So, a lot of great questions, that really I think you had great answers and it's it's interesting to to see how you're building this. So, thank you everyone and see you again next week. Thank you. Bye.
