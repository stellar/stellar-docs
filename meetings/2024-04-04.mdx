1. Piyal surfaced the proposal for a [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1467) and requested feedback.
2. Cubist, an ecosystem project, discussed CubeSigner, a low-latency API for generating keys and signing transactions inside secure hardware.
3. Stellar-based example of CubeSigner is available in the [Cubist Labs Github repository](https://github.com/cubist-labs/CubeSigner-TypeScript-SDK/tree/main/examples/stellar)
4. Cubist devs can be contacted via the Stellar discord or the [web form](https://cubist.dev/contact-form-cubesigner-hardware-backed-key-management).
