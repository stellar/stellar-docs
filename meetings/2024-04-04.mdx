## [Public Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1224408179363024918)

This session covered two complementary areas of the Stellar developer ecosystem: standardizing wallet interactions and improving key management and signing infrastructure. The first part focused on a proposed Wallet Standard, aimed at improving interoperability between wallets, dapps, and tooling.

The second part featured a live presentation from Cubist, an ecosystem project, highlighting how hardware-backed key management and low-latency signing can be integrated into Stellar-based applications. Together, these discussions explored how better standards and infrastructure can improve developer experience and end-user security.

### Key Topics
