## [Public Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1224408179363024918)

This session covered two complementary areas of the Stellar developer ecosystem: standardizing wallet interactions and improving key management and signing infrastructure. The first part focused on a proposed Wallet Standard, aimed at improving interoperability between wallets, dapps, and tooling.

The second part featured a live presentation from Cubist, an ecosystem project, highlighting how hardware-backed key management and low-latency signing can be integrated into Stellar-based applications. Together, these discussions explored how better standards and infrastructure can improve developer experience and end-user security.

### Key Topics

- Wallet Standard proposal from Piyal
  - Overview of the proposed Wallet Standard and its goals
  - Improving interoperability between wallets and applications
  - Request for ecosystem feedback on scope, APIs, and expectations
- CubeSigner
  - Overview
    - Introduction to CubeSigner as a secure, low-latency signing service
    - For key generation and transaction signing inside secure hardware
    - Positioning CubeSigner as infrastructure for production-grade apps
  - Stellar integration demo
    - Walkthrough of a Stellar-based CubeSigner example
    - Demonstration of API: generating keys, signing, and submitting transactions
    - Practical considerations for integrating CubeSigner into existing workflows
- Ecosystem engagement
  - How developers can provide feedback on the Wallet Standard
