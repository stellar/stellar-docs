- Hello and welcome everybody.
- My name is Julian Martinez, senior developer advocate and common man here at SDF and I'm super excited to get today's session kicked off where we're going to dive into the basics of building full stack DAPs using Stellar smart contracts.

On July 31, 2024, the Stellar Development Foundation hosted "The Future of DApps: Building on Stellar", a developer session for the global community. Builders traded notes on Contract, Token, and Function.

Hello and welcome everybody. My name is Julian Martinez, senior developer advocate and common man here at SDF and I'm super excited to get today's session kicked off where we're going to dive into the basics of building full stack DAPs using Stellar smart contracts. Um, so this is going to be kind of like a freestyle like ad hoc session.

Key discussion threads:

- Contract anchored the developer session as speakers compared real-world examples.
- Practical demos highlighted how Token applies to Stellar builders.
- Attendees outlined next steps around Function for upcoming releases.
