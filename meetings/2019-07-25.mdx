## [Public Discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/a9JH2c3jTEw/m/k5wg4XNnDAAJ)

### Agenda

- [CAP-0024](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0024.md) - Path Payment w/Fixed Amount
  - Jon to follow up with Morley to get perspective on how this feels from a wallet implementation's perspective, particularly between the two operations.
- [CAP-0015](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0015.md)
  - Implementation question around removal of one-time signers, which currently does not take place.
  - Consensus: preserve existing behavior for now and discuss behavior changes separately.
  - Jon to follow up with Nico when he returns to better understand existing behavior.
- [CAP-0021](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0021.md), [CAP-0022](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0022.md), [CAP-0025](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0025.md) - Preconditions, Invalid Transaction Effects, Shadow Bucket Removal
  - CAP-0025 moves to Final Comment Period (FCP): Acceptance.
  - CAP-0021 is dependent on CAP-0022.
  - CAP-0022 must address additional feedback from Nico.
  - David to own follow-up on CAP-0021/0022 dependency resolution.
