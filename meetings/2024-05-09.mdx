This session explored how passkeys can be used as a secure and user-friendly signing mechanism for Soroban smart contracts. Tyler presented a working voting application that leverages passkeys to sign transactions, demonstrating how modern web authentication can integrate cleanly with on-chain logic.

The discussion expanded into broader implications for smart wallets on Soroban, including fee sponsorship challenges, signer abstractions, and interoperability with existing password managers. Participants examined how passkeys could bridge web2 authentication patterns with web3 smart contract interactions.

### Key Topics

1. Tyler built a voting application using passkeys to sign the transaction, which is an implementation of the `secp256r1` verification function.
2. He showed a cross-platform implementation (web and mobile) and demonstrated that passkeys are the perfect interface between web3 contracts and web2 authentication mechanisms that most end users are accostomed to.
3. Ecosystem members discussed the use of smart wallets that would use passkeys as a signer. Challenges were identified around fees requires for smart wallets, the need for a common implementation for a smart wallet, as well as how might it interface with existing password managers.
