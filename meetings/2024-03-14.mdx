## [Public Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1217193723612368926)

This session captured a CAP Core Team review of several proposals aimed at improving Soroban’s cost model, performance, and developer ergonomics. Proposal authors presented their work, explained motivations and tradeoffs, and received direct feedback from the Core Team.

The discussion emphasized reducing overall execution costs, improving cost accuracy, and carefully expanding host functionality, while maintaining protocol stability. The CAP Core Team noted they would deliberate and deliver final votes asynchronously.

### Key Topics

- CAP review process
  - CAP Core Team (including Nicholas and David) reviewed ecosystem-submitted proposals
  - Authors presented rationale, scope, and implementation details
  - Core Team feedback focused on correctness, cost impact, and long-term maintainability
  - Final decisions to be communicated via email
- Cryptography and host functionality
  - `CAP-0051` by `@leigh`: add support for `secp256r1` verification as a host function
    - Enables WebAuthn-style authentication and broader cryptographic interoperability
    - Discussed scope and implications for Soroban authorization
- TTL and lifecycle management
  - `CAP-0053` by `@tdep`: separate functions for extending TTL of contract instance and contract code
    - Allows more granular and cost-efficient lifetime management
    - Avoids overpaying for long-lived code when instances change frequently
- Soroban cost model refinements
  - `CAP-0054` by `@graydon`: refine VM instantiation costs
    - Breaks monolithic VM instantiation cost into more accurate components
    - Aims to better reflect actual resource usage
  - `CAP-0055` by `@graydon`: reduce costs by linking fewer host functions during VM instantiation
    - Lowers overhead for contracts that do not use the full host function surface
  - `CAP-0056` by `@graydon`: cache parsed Wasm modules within a transaction
    - Avoids repeated parsing when multiple invocations reference the same Wasm
    - Improves performance and reduces redundant computation
