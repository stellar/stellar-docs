This session highlighted recent improvements and practical guidance around Soroban RPC tooling, with an emphasis on developer workflows. The discussion walked through how developers can more easily interact with Soroban using modern TypeScript bindings and clarified options for running or choosing RPC infrastructure.

The conversation also covered hands-on operational topics, including standing up a local `stellar-rpc` instance and deploying a Stellar Asset Contract on mainnet under the current Phase 0 constraints, helping developers understand what is possible today and how to get started.

### Key Topics

- TypeScript bindings
  - Updates and current state of the Soroban TypeScript SDK
  - Improved ergonomics for interacting with Soroban RPC
  - Practical examples and guidance from ongoing development work
- RPC infrastructure options
  - Overview of available Soroban RPC providers
  - Tradeoffs between managed providers and self-hosted setups
- Running `stellar-rpc` locally
  - Using the official Docker image to stand up an RPC instance
  - Common setup patterns for local development and testing
- Stellar Asset Contract deployment (Phase 0)
  - Installing and invoking a Stellar Asset Contract on mainnet
  - Constraints and expectations under Phase 0
  - How RPC tooling fits into real-world deployment workflows
