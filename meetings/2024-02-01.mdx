## [Public Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1201979721211203614)

This session explored a proposal to add a Soroban host function for verifying `secp256r1` signatures, primarily to support WebAuthn-style authentication flows. The motivation is to better connect off-chain authentication (passkeys, phones, platform authenticators) with on-chain authorization, improving usability for end-user applications like wallets.

The discussion focused on scope (verification vs recovery), developer experience implications, missing primitives needed for WebAuthn payloads, and how such functionality fits Soroban’s “batteries included” philosophy.

### Key Topics

- The proposal is to advance `stellar-core` by adding a host function to verify the `secp256r1` signature, which is the most common elliptic curve used outside of the blockchain space. It is useful in connecting off-chain authentication interfaces with on-chain functionality.
- Note that the proposal is not for a new signer type but a host function.
- Leigh investigated adding support for the WebAuthN use case, by allowing a custom account / smart contract to sign soroban auth entries using a secp256r1-signed payload.
- `secp256r1` is supported by phones, passkeys, and enables an app to replace passwords. This is a massive benefit to user-facing applications like wallets.
- Pros and cons of the interface: blockchains generally implement the recovery interface over the verification interface but verification is easier for developers as it reduces burden on the client and the network.
- The WebAuthN use case requires encoding and decoding of `base64` payloads and decoding JSON blobs, which is not currently supported in Soroban.
- While there are hacky ways of accomplishing the latter, it’s not a great developer experience and final implementation is susceptible to breakages on updates.
- It is also costly to bundle decoding with verification in guest.
- Soroban has always led with a batteries included mindset. Keeping in line with that approach, it makes sense to further investigate and determine whether a host function makes sense for these as well.
- Leigh’s implementation may require further evaluation of the crates used for ECDSA and `p256`.
- Brief discussion around proposed process for adding of a host function by a non-core dev.
