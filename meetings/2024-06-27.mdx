This session featured Chad and Willem from Aha Labs walking through recent enhancements to the revamped `stellar-cli`. The discussion focused on how the CLI has evolved to better support Soroban development while unifying workflows across the broader Stellar ecosystem.

The presenters highlighted usability improvements, new commands, and local development features designed to streamline common tasks such as network setup, account management, and contract initialization. They also shared a preview of planned expansions to cover more Stellar operations and tighter tooling integration.

### Key Topics

- Overview of the new `stellar-cli`:
  - Transition from the `soroban` command namespace to `stellar`
  - Cleaner, more consistent interface across Stellar and Soroban workflows
- Local Development Workflows
  - Local network setup and management with `stellar network container [start|logs]`
  - Account creation and funding via `stellar keys [generate|fund|ls]`
- Contract Development Support
  - `stellar contract init` for scaffolding new Soroban projects
  - Built-in helpers for transaction signing and testing
- Roadmap and Future Improvements
  - Expanded support for additional Stellar operations
  - Planned integration with Stellar Lab V2 for a smoother developer experience
