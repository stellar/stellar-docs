## [Public Discussion](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1475)

This session focused on two closely related topics: proposed changes to the Stellar Ecosystem Proposal (SEP) process, and practical feedback from teams implementing SEP-42 Asset Lists. Together, these discussions highlighted how standards evolve in practice and how process design can better support ecosystem participation.

The conversation emphasized decentralizing standards development, lowering barriers for contributors, and incorporating real-world implementation feedback into the evolution of SEPs.

### Key Topics

- Updates to the SEP process
  - Proposed changes from the Standards Working Group
  - Goal of making the SEP process more decentralized and ecosystem-driven
  - Evidence of success: the updated process has already been used for multiple proposals
- SEP-42 Asset List implementation feedback
  - Real-world experience from Soroswap implementing SEP-42
  - Lessons learned from drafting and adopting the Asset List standard
  - How implementation feedback informs improvements to the SEP
- Ongoing discussion and iteration
  - Feedback and refinements continuing directly in the SEP proposal document
  - Emphasis on open, asynchronous discussion via GitHub
- Next steps
  - Gather additional ecosystem feedback
  - Update the GitHub SEP repository to reflect the refined SEP process

### Outcomes

1. The Standards Working Group proposed changes to the SEP process that empower the ecosystem by making the current process more decentralized and ecosystem-friendly.
2. The process has already been used for several proposals over the last three months.
3. Esteblock from Soroswap shared their journey of participating in the proposal for Asset Lists and implementing the proposed standard
4. Next step is to get further ecosystem feedback then update the GitHub SEP repository with the updated SEP process.
