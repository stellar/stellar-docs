## [Public Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/897514728459468821/1249708164366995527)

This session focused on advancing passkeys as a core building block for smart wallets on Stellar, showcasing real applications, developer tooling, and infrastructure services that reduce friction around signing, fees, and account management. Tyler demonstrated how passkeys can be used end-to-end in authorization flows and transaction signing.

The discussion also looked ahead to ecosystem-wide interoperability, introducing a draft smart wallet standard and services that abstract away common hurdles like fee payment and sequence numbers. Together, these pieces aim to make passkey-powered wallets practical, auditable, and ready for broader mainnet adoption.

### Key Topics

1. Tyler created Super Peach, a web3 application that uses passkeys to sign transactions. He demonstrated how passkeys can be used in authorization flows and how they can be used to sign transactions.
2. Introduced `passkey-kit`, a TypeScript SDK for creating and managing Smart Wallets via passkeys (includes the actual [Smart Wallet interface](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit/tree/main/contracts)).
3. Introduced [Launchtube](https://github.com/stellar/launchtube), a service for submitting transactions onchain by covering both the transaction fee AND the sequence number. Wild!

4. He shared his vision for pushing the passkey implementation through to becoming a standard for the ecosystem. The draft Smart Wallet standard documents the proposed V1 interface (admin, session, and recovery signers), hosted reverse lookup helpers, and future hooks (policy-enforcing contracts, richer multisig flows) so that passkey-powered wallets can be audited and deployed on mainnet with a predictable ABI.
