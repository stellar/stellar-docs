1. Tyler created [Super Peach](https://github.com/kalepail/superpeach), a web3 application that uses passkeys to sign transactions. He demonstrated how passkeys can be used in authorization flows and how they can be used to sign transactions.
   - [Code](https://github.com/kalepail/superpeach)
   - [Demo](https://superpeach.xyz)
2. Introduced `passkey-kit`, a TypeScript SDK for creating and managing Smart Wallets via passkeys (includes the actual [Smart Wallet interface](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit/tree/main/contracts)).
   - [Code](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit)
   - [Demo](https://passkey-kit-demo.pages.dev)
3. Introduced [Launchtube](https://github.com/stellar/launchtube), a service for submitting transactions onchain by covering both the transaction fee AND the sequence number. Wild!
   - Code: [Code](https://github.com/kalepail/launchtube) (ask in the `#passkeys` channel on Discord for a testnet token)
4. He shared his vision for pushing the passkey implementation through to becoming a [standard for the ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_Wom6eK1UpC3E7VuQZfOBCLc2d5lvqAhMN7VPieMBQ). The draft Smart Wallet standard documents the proposed V1 interface (admin, session, and recovery signers), hosted reverse lookup helpers, and future hooks (policy-enforcing contracts, richer multisig flows) so that passkey-powered wallets can be audited and deployed on mainnet with a predictable ABI.
