## Auth Next

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-J3ClTUkrsLiJag906OH4hmNkZI3Jk6_Y9ZYt_psAI) was the guiding design proposal discussed. It outlines a direction for unifying Soroban authorization by replacing `invoker`, `soroban-auth`, and ad hoc schemes with a single account-abstraction model and standardized authorization payloads so contracts stay focused on business logic.

- By generalizing authorization through account abstraction, contracts can treat classic accounts and programmable wallets uniformly, delegating signature verification, nonce handling, and policy enforcement to account contracts that expose a single `check_auth` entry point.
- Contract invocations are authorized via structured payloads that capture the full call stack. Preflight recording determines what will execute so wallets can construct correct payloads, while the host tracks nonces per account-root pair.
- The proposal includes a built-in account contract for classic accounts, recommends temporary or scoped storage (such as short-lived approvals) instead of long-lived allowances, and presents proof-of-concept patterns like timelocks, atomic swaps, and token approvals, along with notes on SDK and host implications.
- This approach introduces added complexity in preflight, larger transaction footprints, and new host responsibilities. The intent is to reduce ecosystem fragmentation, simplify wallet integration, and focus authorization logic within a consistent framework.
