Alejandra introduced Project Slingshot—the umbrella for Stellar’s zero-knowledge toolchain (zkVM transaction format, bulletproof circuits, networking stack). The talk focused on design goals: combine confidentiality, programmability, and modular deployment so devs can run it as a sidechain, a private ledger, or embed the full node as a library.

She walked through the VM’s execution model (transactions as mini programs, constraint-system emission, bulletproof verification), showed sample instructions and contracts, and compared the approach to Stellar, Ethereum, and Zcash. Live questions covered use cases such as collateralized loans, payment channels, and the integration roadmap with Stellar’s consensus.

Key discussion threads:

- Why Slingshot/zkVM exists: encrypted assets by default, zero-knowledge proofs (bulletproofs), and modular components that can be used on- or off-chain.
- How the VM executes “PDF-like” transactions, builds constraint systems, and enforces rules without touching global state.
- Sample applications: confidential payments, programmable order books, collateralized loans, and two-party payment channels built with predicates.
- Roadmap questions: running zkVM as a sidechain, bridging Stellar assets, and packaging the node/network stack for wider testing.

hi so hello everyone today we're going to talk about project slingshot and ZJ diem my name is Alejandra and I work at stellar on this project for the some time already so I'd like to give you an overview why we do that how we're going to use it and why is it interesting so let's do the time check all right so the problem that we have is we know about the ball change so how do we
