[00:00] Hello everyone and welcome to this phenomenal panel called Blog Driven Businesses in Latin America. My name is Mercedes Madani from, Leader of Partnerships at By Brand, the virtual wallet developed at Estelar. It's an honor for me to be here today with the leaders of Block Change in Latin America. I want to give a brief introduction so you can get to. I want to give a brief introduction so you can get to know them. I see we're all here, so let's start with Rub n Hello, Rub n and welcome. Tell us a little about Voz y de Arte. Hello, how are you? Can you hear me well? Is this Cristian Perfect? Well, I'm Rub n Galindo, the CEO of El Tiempo or Sitio. I've been in this job for seven years. It's been

[01:00] A great adventure. We started with the mission of giving financial freedom to the people of Latin America because we believe it's a human right to have access to financial services that let you do what you want to do, And many times, as I said, Are you listening". We're not listening 65, friend, My computer is telling me it's changing the audio selection". But well, we think it's financial freedom, and because of that feeling of Injustice, We created this platform so that everyone can have access to money that is connected to the rest of the world, no matter where they are or the conditions in their countries. And I love being here in a

[02:00] Blogging discussion because I believe that this financial freedom movement, or this fight, is a decentralized fight being waged on different fronts by different companies that make up different parts of the ecosystem, And I would love for this call to result in more entrepreneurs willing to join the battle, taking on a role in any of the verticals or supply chain steps to give Americans and people all over the world financial freedom. Thanks to Ruben, the mission is impressive And well, we want to hear more. Now let me introduce Jacques. Thank you for your invitation. Hello everyone, I'm Jack Saracco, co-founder and leader of business development and partnerships in Seattle. We are the largest fiat ramp in Latin

[03:00] America. We acquire users by letting them buy crypto with local fiat in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. And well, it seemed very logical, Rub n we started in 2018 with the goal of helping the masses, everyone to transition from fiat to crypto in the easiest, fastest and most scalable way possible. I think we're in a phase of greater infrastructure, where the art is richer, and we aim to help decentralize institutions with centralized applications that want to start attracting users and giving them financial freedom, But we're always thinking about how to give Latin Americans, who mostly suffer from inflation and excessive monetary power, the opportunity to give this power back to the people and the

[04:00] User, instead of letting a few keep it. So that's what we do at Zettel, and I think I share exactly the same view as Rub n If we can get more entrepreneurs from this who want to create more applications with more motivation, creating a bigger crypto industry, everyone wins. Thanks for the intro. We also want to hear more about Voz and being a network. Now, hi, Milagros, can you tell us about Voz and how close you are to Bay Brand and Mercedes Voz, and how close you are to Bay Brand and Mercedes Sole? And thank you for the invitation. My name is Milagros Chorro. I'm the content marketing lead for Buy Brand by Frank T. It's a digital wallet that uses blockchain technology and allows you to buy, store, send and receive. Our wallet is developed on external blockchain, which makes it possible for users to send and receive unlimited transactions for free. We're also part of the Steller Development

[05:00] Foundation, the non-profit organization that oversees the Steller network. To tell you a little about my personal story and how I got here- I have a degree personal story and how I got here. I have a degree in international relations and have worked in marketing for a few years. A little over a year ago, I couldn't have known this industry. I'm super happy to be here and to share this event with this incredible panel of speakers we have today. Thank you so much, Milagros. I want to clarify for those watching that Milagros and I work together and it's amazing to have you here on this panel. And now Mat as eager to hear about Voz and Cronos Page. It's a pleasure and a pleasure to everyone else for being here. Thank you. I 'm a co-founder and I'm the head of Cronos, but it's a startup that basically focuses on this fight, As the guys were saying,

[06:00] The difference between big and small players in South America, with all the struggles of the big players and the high costs of transfers and collections, is significant. We basically apply all the technology of Block Change, particularly to the Stellar platform, trying to optimize all those channels and bring cost optimization and transaction speed not only to individuals but also to companies, entrepreneurs and freelancers. We also focus very importantly not only on online payments but also on in person payments, which I can explain in a bit more detail later if you'd like. We explain in a bit more detail later if you'd like. We want to hear from everyone Impressive and super innovative. Well, with this panel of 10, we want to spread the word about. With this panel of 10, we want to spread the word about the possibilities of Block Change technology and continue to boost the ecosystem by democratizing access for users, developers and entrepreneurs alike. We believe this panel should be interactive, so if you have any questions, please ask them through

[07:00] The chat At the end of the talk. We'll try to answer some. Okay, let's begin. I want to start with a pretty simple question: How did you discover Block Change and what's your story in the ecosystem. Rub n Let's see if you want to start over. Sure, with pleasure. I started in Blog Change in the In 2015, maybe in 2014,. Someone invited me to breakfast in November to talk about Bitcoin. I was at my best friend's house. He's getting married tomorrow and I have to write some pitches for his wedding There. At that table, I had an offer to go and be an intern at what were the first sexting- described programs. That existed and it was called, but I didn't know

[08:00] If I wanted to go. We just wanted to go, so much. I arrived in San Francisco on January 1st or 8th, I think, of 2015, at this startup and our task in this state as interns would be to sell it. We didn't know who we interns would be to sell it. We didn't know who we could sell the promise of the block to. They even had their own Research Inc, which was a very unique abstraction of the blog for their coins, and they very unique abstraction of the blog for their coins, and they were doing it before everyone else. We tried to sell it to mobile phone companies, banks, remittance companies, but nobody wanted it. Then one of our co founders said: Look here we have the technology that would help us give anyone access to free money. Who is this free money thinking", And we're going to understand Why. People were using Bitcoin from Argentina to Venezuela, and obviously it's quite easy or simple.

[09:00] The reason is that people see value in this technology because they lack financial freedom. So, working in the pulp industry, wanting to be an entrepreneur, and being from San Francisco, that's how the idea came about: to fight for those who lack freedom, leveraging both of us. I loved the story and well, the best part is writing to your chips for the wedding. Not exactly, not exactly. If you want, I can tell you a little bit about how I started around 2016 2017 describing it for the first time, seeing where it was moving, how it interacted, I think, as Argentinians, the vast majority got into it because of inflation, the peso, the

[10:00] Potential to create a reserve that no one can touch and that they can erase from being the owner can touch and that they can erase from being the owner of it In 2018, the question was: how do we create something that has a lot of was? How do we create something that has a lot of future value? And our analysis was: we see that today, 99 99 of the world's money is on the institutional side, How do we create something that directly helps people To get into Christ? We had a. I personally had a pretty difficult time. It was poorly written. I had to buy P2P from people and buy a little bit of Bitcoin every now and then. The transactions were in cash because otherwise I was afraid that someone would take advantage of me. So somehow we thought about how we could solve that problem. Well, that's how we came up with the idea that problem. Well, that's how we came up with the idea of making a ramp. Look at that moment. And then, a bit inspired by the idea

[11:00] Of a ramp, look here. This, inspired by the idea of a ramp, look here. This product can be clicked on. It will be a product for sending and moving money internationally from one place to another. We had many clients who were asking us for it. And at that moment, in early 2019, the question was: Okay which is the cheapest block? The one that allows you to send funds from one place to another". We started looking at absolutely all of them, all those that were in the top 10, top 20 at that time. Of those were in the top 10, top 20 at that time. Of those 5 remained which are still there today. Well, Stellar among them. We said, Okay let's start doing operations on Stellar because it's scalable, it's fast". And today, from the mindset of an Argentinian, with The costs in Argentina, didn't make sense. Paying in mystery for an angle that cost between 4 and 8 was the GAFI Global Action Fund). We said, between 4 and 8 was the GAFI Global Action Fund). We said, Well, this is unscalable". It started in Argentina, but it's already very expensive. So what's cheaper than the Dominican Republic? Well, Estelar was also

[12:00] A name not for us. And that's how we became Ramp, Fiat, Era Corp for everything related to fabric. We created the table with the Argentine currency and the Brazilian real. Very good story. Good, very visionary too. Five years. Well to share. My story is very different and very recent compared to Jackie and Rub n's Their delivery to the world of Block Sing during the pandemic. In my case, before starting Block Sing, I worked for other startups that had nothing to do with Chinese crypt blogs And, while it seemed like a very interesting industry in which I had worked previously, at that time I was close to finishing my studies. I wanted to start exploring other industries, growing a little more in marketing, and that's how I got to By Brand. I got there for work and ended up falling in love with blogging, But well, at the

[13:00] Beginning, having no experience in this, I had to immerse myself and learn from scratch All the new concepts and knowledge that I didn't have. I knew a little about blogs, without knowing much about crypto because of my previous job, but well, my knowledge was super limited compared to what I know now. The truth is, as I was saying, I was lucky enough to work with a low- cost option like this one, and I think that played. A cost option like this one, and I think that played a super favorable role in allowing me to experiment a bit on a personal level with crypto And also Bailantas- let's say, months before I started working- saw the opportunity to give Argentinians this alternative means to protect themselves from devaluation. And what I liked most about the app is that it's designed to expand access to students like me. Yes, it has a great mission, which is to democratize crypto, making it super easy,

[14:00] Allowing all Argentinians to access a secure wallet in their profile. So that's a bit of the story of how I discovered. Well, thanks to Milagro, and well, I hope that all the recent graduates watching us are inspired and encouraged to join the ecosystem. So, yes, that's it. So my journey also started as, Being Argentinian, I was looking for ways to maintain the value of the currency around 2015, which I became very involved in. After that, I was heavily involved in the development side, trying to provide solutions for document certification based on origin. I delved deeply into blogs to understand how to assign value to a digitally transmitted document and verify its authenticity. This was the first multinational company

[15:00] I'd worked for in a, the first multinational company I'd worked for in a long time, and it was a success. What we did was certify educational documents. We brought this project to the US and there we basically added a QR code to the university document. This QR code was used to certify that it truly came from the issuing entity and verify that the person was presenting it for work, for example, their academic record. So I started strong with the blockchain aspect, especially the certification side. After this, understanding the South American landscape and seeing that there was a payment processing technology that had n't been updated in 20 years, we're now 100% focused on trying to modernize it- Those payment processing- with BlockChange and basically, with the Stellar solution. So that's how we are. Well, thank you, Mat as I love seeing the different paths you took and, well, the use case you just described in terms of how you

[16:00] Enter, which demonstrates the different capabilities of what you can do in BlogChange and not So well, great, Okay. Another question: I'd love to know more about how Piti Sanz BlogChange operates in his companies and what he believes are the main benefits of BlogChange for his clients. Let's start with, since this time it works perfectly Well. We are native to BlogChange. You understand that we created the company to be able to provide solutions for written companies and BlogChange companies in particular. One of the services we offer, as I mentioned, is that we accept fiat in Argentina, Basic and Mexico, and we provide scripting services. You can make purchases not only of decentralized applications to wallets and ecosystems, but also to institutional clients. We have many companies that do corporate banking, whether on one side or the other.

[17:00] From that, we are very interested in working. We realized that there was a very high cost in remittance transactions, both for retail people who have access to US money, for example, to Latin America, or for companies wanting to pay their Argentine or Latin American subsidiaries. We saw that there was a very high cost. So the opportunity to use a block change was incredible because having a double option low cost and fast execution made us very scalable. This was especially true for the counterparty, which would be the institutional banking services that have been developing for the last 50 years. Logically, in 2018 and 2019, it was very difficult for us to get people from these companies like Txemi to understand how they could use these transactions to their advantage. Txemi to understand how they could use these transactions to their advantage When they really started to see that they were saving a lot of money, especially

[18:00] In their stocks, and began to see the genuine use case in their day to day operations and in their own pockets. It became even more challenging in their day to day operations and in their own pockets. It became even more challenging. But when they started wanting to repeat the operations with higher volumes and began to tell people saying, This works and it's real". I think it's very important to highlight that in 2018 and 2019, many They believed that writings and before that, not much crypto production remained as something illegal, something from the black market that you shouldn't get involved in. Today, I think 2022 changed the perspective a lot. Today it seems like entrepreneurship, innovation and the future, with a lot more agility and transparency, when just a few years ago it wasn't like that And when just a few years ago it wasn't like that, And I think that we're going to start seeing more and more companies moving in this direction. It's incredible that many more people from the institutional sector are starting to give it the option of registering as a medium to interact financially in the

[19:00] Future. Great Thanks for the details. I love hearing about companies that develop the infrastructure and ramps in Latin America that continue working on access to blogs and getting more people- let's say, more end users- to join. I think it's super important. I think we're like a bridge that takes people from fiat to crypto, and the objective of applications, like you'll see, like the Mokro footer, I don't know is also to maintain users and give them a service within the cryptocurrencies, while we are the bridge that interacts from one side to the other. Great, I'd like to add. I think He's absolutely right. Given that we're on a panel with other entrepreneurs, I think it's important for everyone to see how the Chinese blog is not just technology

[20:00] That allows I'm saying specifically applied to payments but it allows for much smoother and cheaper payments, this exchange of information and money. It's also technology that democratizes access for entrepreneurs to participate in a business that was previously extremely exclusive and only available to banks and financial institutions, that needed a huge investment to participate. In a way, we, as industry leaders, are intermediating these players, the dinosaurs, and it 's now completely open. Anyone can participate, So it makes me not only a disruptive technology but also, I think, a great tool for starting businesses and generating value,

[21:00] With or without a few barriers to entry. I absolutely love it. I totally agree. It's great to communicate this to entrepreneurs so they know it's possible and are encouraged to join the ecosystem, And so, obviously, everyone on this panel, as industry leaders, I think it's crucial that they join these talks and tell us a bit about their story, what they're doing today and the problems they're solving, so that we can evolve ecosystem together. And to talk a little about this, well, in our case, with Buy Brand, as I mentioned before, Fiverr gave Argentinians the opportunity and access to a means to safeguard the value of their

[22:00] Assets, and well as an app, the value of their assets and well as an app. Developed in Estelar Vaiv n it was specifically designed to extend this access to coins pegged to the price of the dollar. Like me, yes, and I think that, with respect to the general benefits of this technology, I think the most important benefit we could highlight for us is decentralization. I think it's a key characteristic of the technology and it's its strength, since to authenticate transactions or operations, you don't need any kind of intermediary, and this obviously allows for reduced validation times. On the other hand, we have the fact of network distribution. When you have a distributed network, in the first instance nobody owns that network, and I think that means users don't always have a record of

[23:00] The information. And also, as the guys mentioned before, the technology has very, very low costs for users, which I think is the star advantage of blockchain. And well, in our case, in the case of, and well, in our case, in the case of Buy Brand, transactions in the systems described are also carried out by individuals without any involvement from a central control body. What does this mean? Again, Without any intermediary, This allows for a reduction in costs. Let's say, network maintenance makes it significantly cheaper, right, And lastly, I think we could also highlight, as the guys mentioned earlier, the speed. Crypto transactions are super fast to process, I'd say practically instantaneous- and I think this is also a great solution that Blogs Reynolds has the power to streamline these slow banking transaction processes.

[24:00] Great thanks, Milagros, for telling us more about By Brand. And now, Mat as regarding Canon, in the case of Cronos Pay, I know of a Cross case. Basically, we were born 100% in Blogs. It was also the decision about who would fight to run a bit of what we talked about- cost, speed of distribution- and we all chose Estelar for that reason. But we were born in Block Change, always thinking that technology will help, as it is helping, to change the payment processing system. Going into a bit more detail, when an account is generated within Cronos Space, an account is automatically created with Estelar and from there, depending on the country, a bank account is

[25:00] Generated for that country, It requires- and there we use the other stilts of the ecosystem to do the Rambo, a ramp off as Jack said, of this vile coin and the connection to fiat in each of the countries and we also use the crypto stilts to sometimes get out water, yum, str, sub 20 depending, let's say, on the alternatives that are required and adding a little to what Rub n was saying, the reason why, let's say for me the Rub n was saying, the reason why, let's say for me, the importance of all these changes or of people from outside the traditional financial system getting involved. I want to be electronic. I have a master's degree in finance, but my education wasn't, let's say, in the financial part, but rather we were a little more than anything. From the experience and the problems we have in emerging countries and a little studying how all this was composed, you see that the banks initially worked with these

[26:00] Systems and that there are several and they are unique, and that they always took turns so that it remained within their very closed ecosystem in the financial part until, at a certain point, a very select group, let's say, generated a very elite club where they went to eat caviar and in a very particular way, and that's where the first credit card was generated, Created in the club which was the one for dinners, and they say it was used, let's say, for those types of transactions. That's when banks started generating their own credit cards and the banks themselves own the credit cards. So it's still the same ecosystem. And today, where are we going with Cronos, Page That is, there's a possibility that Blanchett technology gives us to try to avoid all those high commissions charged for centralized transfers. We can use a different method so that anyone who might have a business in Peru, Ecuador, Charco or any province

[27:00] In South America or an emerging country can collect payments with their phone with no costs, and the money goes to intermediaries instead of people. It's great, it's a new paradigm And well, I love hearing that all these companies are like blogs on Late Night. I don't know that they companies are like blogs on Late Night. I don't know that they started directly in blogs. So I think it's super innovative, especially since they're trying to optimize a system, not completely change it. I think it's great. And now I see an interesting question in the chat. They ask how they see the developer market in Stellar, particularly Other blocks in Snow, as Jon Solana says, and which are concentrating talent, see that they can be a chalet for climbing or developing new

[28:00] Ideas. I think that, as entrepreneurs, we can't be married to a particular technology, because what we want is to solve people's problems, and people have problems that may need different technologies. From our perspective, we see that by dedicating ourselves to giving people crypto dollar accounts and with so many different versions of crypto on different platforms or in different options. We have to be as versatile as possible to fulfill our mission, and we have to be compatible with any technology, because what matters is not what technology you use. What matters is your ability to solve people's problems. What I like about Tela, compared to the others, is that Tela is very focused on creating decentralized rails for money to connect

[29:00] The world's money And then all the investment that the Stellar team makes, which is truly a super team, and obviously today I'm going to say that because Stellar investors of time and of ours, but I've worked with them for a long time and I we've worked with them for a long time and I can seriously attest to that. The quality of the team and you can also see the amount of investment they make in developing the ecosystem, not only by bringing in participants like Artem or Acero or by creating their own tools like Bail n to understand how their technology should be used from the entrepreneurs' point of view. They also do versions with giant companies like MoneyGram and they are also working on sets with Justice and Exchange and also with

[30:00] Stand, working closely with regulators. They have a 100% focus on the financial sector and the others have more of a website focus. We are going to create the decentralized world and so imagine that huge task From the decentralized world. A very big part is getting money in and out of the very big part is getting money in and out of the decentralized world, but the truth is that they are trying to build everything from scratch and I think that, as an entrepreneur, gives me a lot of anxiety to think that I have to do everything because you can't do everything. So around me, the star postcard is well focused because I believe in the approach. I totally agree with the question. Very interesting. You respect it. I think I share what I had thought directly,

[31:00] Which is to learn specifically. It was each blog who wants to solve Some particular vertical of the Web 3 world. For example, in JR, they want to somehow solve the gaming benefits part. You also have within Solana's writing, the Solana part, and look at what they do in Solana's writing, the Solana part. And look at what they do in Spirits Solana, which is like Defy cheaper within what the competition I think everyone wants to take on a role in the different infinite verticals of Web 3. Without going any further in Action Clean, he indicated that it wasn't useful for him to do gaming, so he went out to do his own Blues in Running, as an example. It ca n't be absolutely everything. It's a great base for many things, but they're going to visit different verticals to execute other things. I think that, as Rubens

[32:00] Telar said, the main focus is finance and payments. If they execute that well, they can grow a lot with the team that has the highest probability of executing it. It's more focused than other blogs because we have to show the use case Well in Tracing even the burning lives. It's that the huge, it's true. And Pierre Transactions, Juan, with how many temptations with transactions can be made, by what means, how fast, at what cost. They aim to streamline a very particular niche, Web 3, is where I see the biggest disruption coming, which is in finance logically decentralized, fast and inclusive. Great, We're touching on a lot of topics, including interoperability, so a discussion can emerge about Web 3 and Blockchain. We're all working on how to make it

[33:00] Much more interoperable. This is just the beginning. The boxing world is like a baby: we're only in its early years and we're all working to make all the systems more interoperable. And your companies are also focusing on all these super interesting topics And the questions you ask us. Well, one more question about the ecosystem and specifically about the roya roya we're discussing: how do you see the Stellar ecosystem and do you work together? Or how do you Stellar ecosystem and do you work together? Or how do you collaborate within the ecosystem, not only Stellar, but also in the Blockchain ecosystem in general? Within that ecosystem, as I mentioned, we have a pillar that connects fiat to crypto.

[34:00] We work with many companies because, ultimately, we are the infrastructure provider for the others. Decentralized, centralized applications can shine and attract users in the region. We work with most of the panelists. We work well with Artem, with Buy Brand LED production and Fiat ramp in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. If all goes well, we're also close to reserving the Cronos service, But we work both in the Stellar ecosystem and in other ecosystems, like Incid o and the one from 20 years ago, providing liquidity and payment gateway service for those users who want to start using crypto within any of the applications Within that, within what is Fiat Honor. We also have, as I mentioned in our table, coins Arte and Barrilete, which would be the Argentine peso and the

[35:00] Brazilian T cnico respectively. They are entirely in English, to be used by anyone who wants to be in the ecosystem within the member sets, which is the Stellar integration. So anyone who wants to be can use it and it can be a means of payment for any application that wants to copy within this ecosystem. Yes, well, as Argentina, obviously it's a source of pride to have the RCT which for obviously it's a source of pride to have the RCT which, for Those who are listening, what is the table comment about the Argentine peso? Well, I always say that number. I mean a very big step in being one of the first to issue the Argentine peso currency and well, to be able to start spreading it in the ecosystem. I'm a fan of RCT for you and well, Milagros, I

[36:00] Mean, they work with ADR for seven hours. Since we're on this topic, tell us a little about the function of RST in the balance sheet. Great Well, in our case, also answering the question of how we work together with Stellar, we work hand in hand to try to solve, or perhaps resolve, a very specific and important problem in Argentina, which is the memory of values. You're probably watching us from different Latin American countries, but, as most of you know, Argentina unfortunately has an unstable economy. This brings with it certain consequences, one of the most noticeable being the fragility of the currency, which, unfortunately, we've already gotten used to. But faced with that, Argentinians tend to look for different alternatives to be able to protect the value of our money. Here in Argentina, one of the most

[37:00] Used resources is buying dollars, but with the obstacles we have and also the risks of potentially buying on a parallel market, Argentinians started looking for other alternatives. So, thanks to the progress of blogs and after working with this one, I'll share a super interesting option today: buying crypto. This not only allows us to safeguard value, which I think is again our number one problem, but also gives us access to this 100% digital economy. It also allows us to work alongside, for example, to have new services. And going back to the topic of the recipe, there is an asset, a coin pegged to the value of the Argentine peso. Through deposits, Argentinians can exchange these coins within the app. There's Oasis and Literary.

[38:00] So if you're in the, There's Oasis and Literary. So if you're in the By Brand wallet- great. The recipe allows you to access the dollar denominated assets, acting as a bridge between fiat currency and dollar denominated assets, which is what people want access to. So great. I love that. If you want to make a comment, It's going to be because of the ecosystem issue. They were talking about the positive thing I see within these environments. What unites us across other ecosystems is that we're working on something particular, working towards a solution that impacts everyone's daily life. So, from that perspective, I think a very particular camaraderie is generated among us all. I know people within the ecosystem who were even involved in other projects, who are now also focused on expanding and who always want to do something to improve the

[39:00] Situation for their country or nationality, We something to improve the situation for their country or nationality. We always address issues like remittances, maintaining the value of their local currency and helping their families in other countries. So I think that those who are part of this in other countries, So I think that those who are part of this blog, have a situation that we all share in emerging countries. That's why this camaraderie is generated: to try to help each other, not just with the kids, particularly in the area of development I also agree that the selection of blogs, which will be seen later, will involve a purging of everything that's out there and because of the dot coms of the world The moment everything started, those that have a very specific focus on a particular market, a vertical- and those are the best- will obviously remain. So, basically, we're going to install them because the objective is very clear and it's not, let's say, a multi sector solution with many options for everyone, but

[40:00] Rather the optimization of financial matters, part of remittances and other services, And I think that's where the focus will grow significantly for the solutions we want. Our goal seems very aligned, as will the objectives of not just creating a star company like Cronos, which has a specific goal. And well, I love hearing in the industry blogs how everyone works together. I think it's something remarkable because, more than anything, that's what entrepreneurs are all about. We all know that the entrepreneurial path is sometimes very lonely and very difficult. So having this camaraderie, this help and this support at the end of the day- seems incredibly important to me. I think that's something that stands out in the crypto world. Although we are very much involved with each other, I think all the calls we're

[41:00] Making, if we're talking about a panel, always come up when all the panelists finish. They are really open to being contacted, always through Twitter, always through email, Telegram. Any questions, let us know if we have a call, if we can refer you. I think it was the beginning where those of us involved in the crypto world wanted to help people get involved and educate themselves, because the risk of a lack of education is very high. So I think you see a lot of companies working together to generate something bigger and crypto entrepreneurs wanting to help and educate people who aren't involved in the subject today to guide them to where they need to go, how and what the fastest way is for us to get involved in many startup proposals that want to start creating the Stellar world. They don't know anything about the sets. They don't Stellar world. They don't know anything about the sets. They don't know how to integrate. They don't know what an author is, and the truth is that we invest a an author is, and the truth is that we invest a lot of time in receiving those calls, accepting them and really

[42:00] Explaining where and what to do, because they also have to go through where and what to do, because they also have to go through the mindset. You have to go through it. And the moment they the mindset, You have to go through it, and the moment they reach the size and level of my code, that is acquired to use any of these products or any service, we can't. Collaborating, getting back in touch with us is great and there are many. We 've really helped to understand what it was like, to understand what the next steps would be and how it would help them or not for what they wanted to create. I think that's one of the most important qualities of the written world and that's how it's believed to have grown in that written world and that's how it's believed to have grown in that decentralization of helping each other between two aggressors. That's what I want to highlight again, that aspect of the industry and also of the Steller ecosystem, not in having the power to call you- You're here" and not ask you those questions- and having that guidance that can save you not only a lot of time but also how to

[43:00] Have that confidence in how to start and how to get into the ecosystem and how to succeed. I always wanted to put the point of this place, which was to ask a question that I would love for him to be telling you about. What would the steps be? He's already experienced the future of integration. Tell me what does it look like. Future of integration. Tell me what does it look like. and where is the path I have to follow to help people not get confused? I think it's about saving time for the whole ecosystem. As I've grown, it's happened to me quite often and well, continuing with the topic of what you consider necessary to develop the integration of Jane blogs in a startup or a new company, I'd love to hear a bit from Rub n about what advice you would give to someone who is starting out Well, I same way that, or rather aligned with

[44:00] The decentralized technology method. I think that, just as all entrepreneurs are quite open- maybe they don't answer Lides because they're busy, but surely they would all be willing to help. Also, all the information one needs to be able to frame this technology and adopt it is everywhere on the internet. It's open to all its teachers- That thing I was saying about Ron and the taxi fort- to be able to have a version that was made to measure, adjusts to the needs and speaks to how accessible it is. They can take copy and paste their clone from the outside or make the changes they needed so that these

[45:00] Actions required more adjustment to their way. You can leave it, there's a vulnerability and they lost a lot. Taj n mirror. At the same time, I think it speaks to how accessible it is for anyone. And so now, yes, and responsibility from the entrepreneur. You must be looking on the internet for the most reliable sources and I think that, compared to other technologies, they've made working with their keyboard super easy. Everything they put in the Web 2 0 language is almost entirely user- put in the Web 2 0 language is almost entirely user- friendly, so that a developer who has already worked in the business world can understand how to apply the technology. There are tons of resources, and everything they develop to help all companies is here.

[46:00] Everything belongs to everyone. So it's a great way, I think, to start. You can say: How is it that they give you a whole framework so you can easily develop your application". And I'm simplifying. You know my identity, I'm a bit of a fool. But I see that our team and I never say obviously not all professions- have their own language like this very solid and all that but nobody has done anything like that. However, in a very familiar way, the documentation and infrastructure are made so that our back end developers can interact with, use and test the technology from home. So Different resources on this side. That's a really good point, for developers. The

[47:00] First question is always: Do I need to? The your Olivetti to develop". And well, in that case you have it. It's effective in several languages. So that makes it easier for someone who is a developer and an expert in another language to focus and start easily. So that's a great point. And if we talk about blogs in the UI- and I could talk for hours about blogs in the UI and I could talk for hours about blogs- without a doubt the people listening are also interested in knowing a little more about you. So I wanted to see if you have any stories or anecdotes about being an entrepreneur or about the ecosystem that you want to share with those listening. I think in recent years the anecdote is like a summer and how the market seems, how it looked four years ago and

[48:00] How it will look in the four years ago and how it will look in the next four years. In entrepreneurship, four years ago, we were crazy. All the banks we called would hang up on us. Everyone thought we worked with drug traffickers and everyone was afraid. And really, when we do everything possible to be in the most compliant option possible, today is the complete opposite. We have banks calling us to see how crypto can be used and how they can innovate on the foundation of Christ. I think that in the next four years, we'll see that all banks will incorporate crypto in one way or another and it will become the norm From four years ago. We'll look like crazy people and we don't believe that. Today, If you feel like you 're creating something, maybe you can get on the right track. Four years later, you'll be a hero because you're trying to create a product that today is perhaps very innovative for what's coming in the future.

[49:00] Yes, great Mat as Any stories to share? Well, it's a comment I got from an acquaintance. It was more of a coffee chat when I started to apply. Let's more of a coffee chat when I started to apply. Let's say a bit of what I think applies to everyone who at some point started with a Chinese blog. When you see all the things you can do- document certification, the applications that finance can have, the whole broad range of applications that the financial sector has- well, a lot of technologies to apply. And I went with all that momentum. Junior entrepreneurs and without my milk, have ideas about all this. And he looked at me and said, Look the. Reality is that, even as a vice president, he doesn't say exactly what you shouldn't do. He tells me:

[50:00] 'You have to try to find a solution, focus and give 100% to that solution ' One is the easiest decision because, with the energy and desire you bring, you say, 'With blocks, we're going to do a lot of things ' and you have a, we're going to do a lot of things ' and you have a lot of serious things as an entrepreneur who starts with this. But if I can add this, I can have a bigger solution. For me, the advice is to focus. Give all your contacts, all your energy and 100% to one solution and not try to be all powerful and have the right to, and not try to be all powerful and have the right to do everything. Otherwise you'll define who can't do anything and only define a couple of things to do, not everything that can be solved. Great Focus is super important. Milagros, any anecdotes you want to tell us? Well, I'll tell you

[51:00] A few Cheers, Doctor. Well, it happened to me that when I started Trip to Blue Change to work in the ecosystem when I had to". explain to ecosystem when I had to", explain to a friend or family member what I was doing, they didn't seem to understand. I tried to explain what Jim's blog was, what By Brandt did, and it was super difficult for everyone to understand. But little by little, with a lot of patience, I started showing each of my family members, uncles and even my grandfather- how to buy By Brandt bikes. It's super easy. And now a year later, I can't believe it. He came and told me he'd bought one. I decided to do a casting call on eBay- 26 Callao- I don't know which is great- And my uncle came and told me he'd already bought one. Yes, the truth is, I'm really proud that in a year, I've been able to convince so many family members and so many other people to join the ecosystem, and I think that's super important. It's an

[52:00] Anecdote I always like to share. In a year, you can do so many things and including so many people in the ecosystem seems really interesting to me, And with this story I'll see how, in a way, working on blogs and also all the people around you not your family, your friends, but in a certain way it's about The way family, your friends, but in a certain way it's about The way they start to get involved and find out. And well, that seems super important to us, Rub n Any stories of yours. Well, I'm going to offer some advice. I think in the history of art there have been many horror stories caused by

[53:00] War. Venturing into this adventure with this new technology has made life difficult, in a way, because we started as pioneers, knowing what it was going to do to us, but, at the same time, clashing with a world that already had fibers that were elsewhere, But that made it difficult for us at the beginning to get up and running. Convincing people to work with us was difficult. We were starting to evangelize everyone and, on top of that, we were starting to evangelize everyone and, on top of that, we were trying to set up a parish that charged fees. So it was difficult. However, what always helped us was keeping in mind that what we wanted was to help people, and we have such a clear vision that it allowed us to keep going when things went badly. And me too, And although things aren't easy,

[54:00] I realize that what differentiates a good entrepreneur from what happens is that one stays with the energy to keep going and another suddenly gets tired of doing it. A vision worthy of time and time itself gives you the energy to keep giving it your all the time you have to give it so that your company, your self employment is excellent and successful. So that's what I'm going to company your self employment is excellent and successful. So that's what I'm going to tell everyone with this advice: choose your missions well, and if you have a vision that drives you, then that's all you need, because the rest- persistence is there, but a worthy mission that makes you persistent. I don't know how it works sometimes. So this advice,

[55:00] And well, back to the focus in terms of financial inclusion: Financial inclusion, yes, of course, that's a distributed mission that aligns us all and we all benefit from it. So they also have a very powerful mission in the world boxing, which is really cool. Great, I see I'm echoing

[56:00] And I apologize. I don't know why, but I wanted to close by talking to everyone and answering a question I saw in the chat, which is how we can be more involved with the ecosystem. And well, Estelar is doing an event in Mexico- not only in Mexico, but also virtually in may- which The event that everyone can join is from May 20th to 22nd, and it's called Startup Weekend, or Blogs in Mexico City. It's super long, but anyway, I'm going to put the link to the chat channel so you can. I'm going to put the link to the chat channel so you can see it and well, so that, according to the system, you'll be encouraged to participate. We want to tell everyone that there's no question that isn't valid, so please contact
