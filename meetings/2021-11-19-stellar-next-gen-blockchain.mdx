- well first i want to thank you so much for inviting me to the speaker series it's an honor to be here and thank you to anka for pulling this together the coordination of things like this is no no small feat and we're very lucky to have her as part of the stellar development foundation pulling these things together for the next gen initiative um today i'm going to talk to you about open networks and digital assets i know that billy explained kind of the ins and outs of of blockchain in general um if you haven't seen that first that first video it is on the stellar next gen discord channel so feel free to take a look if you missed that but billy grannis gave a great talk and something to kind of get you started today i'm going to talk to you about what we do at um stellar development foundation which we call sdf for short and then we'll kind of dive into the applications and use cases of blockchain and specifically stellar i'm going to do probably 10 or 15 slides i'm not sure where the marker is exactly and then kind of pause for questions and they'll have more um extended time for q a at the end um so yeah and if there's any technical difficulty that you can't see or something like that jump in anytime um but yeah i'm i'm excited to be here so my name is aydah vaughn and i work in marketing and communications but i've had uh several years of my career here in blockchain and crypto both as a business developer and um in the area of partnerships so i've worked with a lot of different companies in the space and really excited to be here today to talk to you about stuller from the sdf so let's get started the stellar development foundation is a non-profit entity and we are solely tasked with supporting and maintaining the stellar network so the stellar network and the stellar development foundation exist to create equitable access to the global financial system so how do we do that we do it in three main ways we make money more fluid markets more open and people more empowered and the foundation helps maintain stellar's code base by supporting the technical and business communities around stellar providing thought leadership to regulators and other stakeholders and physically maintaining stellar's code base so everything sdf does is aimed at making the network as a whole stronger and making it a success in its mission so i'm clicking on two screens here stellar itself is a decentralized open network that connects the world's financial infrastructure so blockchains can be used for a lot of different things but stellar is purpose built for connecting financial systems and it does that because of its speed and its scale that can be used for the stellar blockchain to transfer value the exciting thing about blockchain as a technology in general and stellar is one of these chains is that it makes it possible to move money in new ways blockchain makes it possible to create send and trade digital representations also called tokens you'll hear me say tokens and tokenization to mean this digital representation of all forms of money whether it's a dollar a peso a bitcoin it can be anything so it's designed so that all the world's financial systems can work together and travel value on a single network so let's talk about who exactly uses stellar there are a lot of stakeholders involved and because stellar is an open and permissionless network really anyone can build anything they can imagine on stellar to create impact on the global financial system of today stellar is purpose built for working with it so we look to extend and not replace the world's existing financial infrastructure so businesses that want to pay for goods and services across borders banks and fintechs that want to quickly process payments and move assets exchanges that are making for example on-chain liquidity with blockchain more accessible and of course the developers who are building and integrating digital infrastructure across these financial systems governments are interested in stellar and we have a lot of communications where we speak with regulators and kind of inform or try to inform policy makers decisions about blockchain technology and then of course consumers who want to send receive and grow their hard earned money really everyone since entities can offer financial products and services and take advantage of these features to build better solutions to real world problems stellar is uniquely useful so how do they do it we'll talk about that there are three main things that people do on stellar where it adds utility to these processes the first is that in order to move an asset on stellar it has to be tokenized so tokenization of assets is a digital representation it could be what we call fiat assets like a regular currency a dollar a euro a british pound a peso um then once they have that value they need to hold it and they may want to diversify it so they may start out with a us dollar tokenized on stellar but want to move to a mexican peso for example or they may want to send money to someone who when they receive it wants to change it to a different form of value one of the things about blockchain and the reason why it's so valuable for financial systems is that it's immutable so in the case of new technologies for moving money there's a high motivation to tamper with these technologies and because blockchain is so strong in terms of its immutability its inability to be changed and the ability to monitor it it has a particularly high use high value in this use case the third thing that people do once they have assets on stellar is they want to send an exchange as i was saying going across border making a payment to a business in another country or even sending peer-to-peer remittances so i can send you money if you're in a different country and i can use stellar to move that value so the first step i'm going to go through these these three main ways that stellar is used and we'll start out with tokenization so you might wonder how does a dollar get on to stellar and that is this process called tokenization in order to have a universal payment network where value can move everything has to be in this form of a token and so tokens are a redeemable tradable representation of any asset and it only takes a few lines of code to do it on stellar token issuance is really the backbone of the stellar network and it's how we connect all the world's currencies and systems it's what stellar was built for asset issuance is also flexible you can issue a token that represents anything from an ounce of gold to a piece of art to an hour of your time as a consultant could be a real asset could be a service it's up to you today i'm going to talk to you about two main types of assets which are these like non-currency assets i'll call them so things that are not a dollar not a peso things like the um the bit of your time or a piece of art those are non-currency assets and then we'll also talk about fiat-backed assets and the utility for those i love this example so um you know so much of the internet and so much of technology has grown around entertainment right this is an example of a game plan game platform that started with a card game and the cards were able to be traded inside the game and used as assets so they had value only inside the game and um lightning is a tech company they call themselves a tech company that creates innovative products to connect crypto enthusiasts and gamers to unique experiences lightman started off with a site called lightmint.io and this was this is a little screenshot of their game their cards were collectible on the stellar blockchain and then when their community wanted a place to start to trade their cards and interact with one another with the card's value that's when the idea of an nft marketplace came to life so um do you all have the ability to raise your hand on your let me see i should have asked at the beginning to raise your hand so how many folks have heard of an nft okay so now for all the people who have ever owned an nft keep your hand up so um game platforms and nfts are used enlightenment and it allows creators as you may have heard nft stands for a non-fungible token and a non-fungible token is a unit of value that cannot be divided so if you have an nft that represents um an avatar that you drew or a service you're providing whatever it is you cannot split the nft and it has a a single representation and a single owner and um but they can be traded so um this is an example of a game platform that uses nfts um and it's it's pretty neat because um the stellar network is very very cheap to operate unlike some of the other major blockchains and so creators can create can make an nft that costs five or ten or twenty or or even a dollar and because the cost of transactions on stellar is so low that really anyone can do this um which is pretty neat it's another layer of kind of inclusion in stellar that is is pretty fun and it allows for a very flexible um and movable kind of nft so on a more serious note tokenization of securities um i think so i'll do the same question like how many of you own a security own a stock probably everyone right everyone in the room probably owns some sort of security and i think um in go ahead let's see is it every single person that's got to be right everyone's got something something in their portfolio hopefully there are some people that raise their hands can you see them ada yes i can see i i see a seat there's a sea of hands yes i can't i can see that nearly everyone or maybe everyone um has owned a stock um you probably have not owned a tokenized stock and the reason for that is that we live in a high income economy where we have very easy access to high quality securities on you know i can go on e-trade almost any of us can open an account at a fidelity or an e-trade or charles schwab any of these brokerage houses will welcome our business and and allow us to buy securities and enter into other kinds of investment opportunities however in the rest of the world especially in emerging markets it is not that way at all we can buy a share of tesla or apple anytime we want but if someone who is living let's say in a small town in latin america or in sub-saharan africa or other parts of the world they simply don't have access to these kinds of assets and so tokenization of securities is a really interesting use case for blockchain and for stellar specifically i'm going to show you an example of it but it whether it's stock or real estate these kinds of assets again they're not money they're different than a currency asset but they can be tokenized in very similar to securities that can be tokenized into shares and tokens um on stellar so i'm going to show you an example of a company called d stock they have kind of a fun spelling of their name and um give you an idea of how that works so they are a company that offers access to um stocks like apple and tesla like you can see here in emerging markets um they also allow micro investing so you can buy a fraction of a share for someone who maybe only can invest you know 10 euros or 20 euros and this is a really unique way to expand assets expand access to high quality assets that otherwise they would not be able to reach and and they can also securely trade them so inside this app is available in europe um vietnam south africa there are um a number of markets where people can then trade these fractional shares and so it's kind of a marketplace in and of itself um and it's pretty it's a pretty interesting use case for financial inclusion here's one more this company is called realty bets and again realty bits is um a marketplace on stellar and they have built-in infrastructure where people can invest in opportunities like startups like real estate they started out realtyvis story is that they started out with their name as you might imagine mainly doing real estate but then they had these verified you know sponsors and investors involved in their platform and realized that they could do a lot more and so they expanded um to other types of of assets and it allows for cap table management um it just really simplifies the whole process you know normally to invest in a private asset um it's quite a clunky process you know if there's a private equity manager and they got to talk to this person talk to that person it's very slow there's a lot of friction and it's very expensive and so um this just promotes a lot of efficiency and these kind of investor sponsor relationships and streamlines the whole process so realty bits built this platform um and it offers users access to investments that they again wouldn't ordinarily see or where um investing maybe in a small way would be uh too cumbersome so it gives them a faster on-ramp so as you can see from these use cases any any company it's open source any company can issue any kind of asset they want on stellar so now we're going to talk about well my slides have gone crazy sorry um now we're going to talk about the use case for fiat currencies um who here has heard of the term stable coin couple people how about okay so keep your so now i'm gonna ask another one you can lower your hand and then how about cbdc i can say it so fast because i say it a lot cbdc okay a few people not many um stablecoin stablecoin is a relatively new term um when you tokenize an asset on stellar and it happens to be a fiat currency we call it a stable coin and what that means is um because uh blockchain assets grew up in this world of coins like bitcoin everything's a coin something's a coin um stable coins are meant to mean that they are always tied in a one-to-one relationship with their underlying fiat currency so one let's say uh usdc which is a us dollar stable coin we'll talk about in a minute is always worth one u.s dollar and redeemable for that dollar um so stable coins are that kind they can be any representing any of the world's currencies but they always remain stable to the value one coin is one dollar or one coin is one british pound just like that um in the case of cbdc's this is a relatively new um development in blockchain so there are country probably i want to say 60 to 80 projects pilot projects going on around the world and then there are a few that are starting to i think to like roll out and get beyond pilot stage but the idea of a cbdc which stands for central bank digital currency is beyond a stable coin so these are a type of stable coin um that a central bank issues the asset and what that would mean is that that central banker can retain control control of their monetary policy and that they can control the economics and security and functions and there's some programmability on stellar a lot of really neat features but cbdcs are a form of digital currency that are meant to be controlled by a central bank just like ordinary fiat money so kind of central it keeps that central control over the monetary policy oh my hand is raised i can't see who raised their hand are your hands still up from the cbdc question if anyone has a question go ahead and jump right in and speak so i can't see all of you yeah my bad i think i just left it up oh no problem all right great so we are going to talk about usdc um the the oh and i should probably mention anchors before i get uh any further so cbdc's and stable coins as i said are representations of regular money so when you have a regular dollar you give it to an asset issuer and they give you a token um and those issuers we call in the stellar network we call them anchors and that is because they anchor the fiat value to the token and so they're a very important part of the system of onboarding value and off-boarding value to the stellar network and you'll hear more about anchors in just a minute one really important anchor is usdc circle i'm sorry my slides are so jumpy i need a better mouse um the in this uh this graph is actually a little bit out of data i believe we have surpassed today 40 billion um usdc in circulation um so usd stan usdc stands for usd coin um as i said many things are a coin uh in our world usdc is uh issued by regulate regulated financial institutions it's backed one to one by u.s dollars and it's governed by a consortium called center centre i think someone went off mute for a second um and so there are these kind of technical and policy standards financial standards for stable coins usdc is always a dollar um and it's available on multiple networks too which is one of the reasons i think for its fast growth um it has transferred on chain over a trillion dollars um in in a year basically and so there's a lot of movement of usdc it's super useful um as a way of moving value without losing value because it's always stable it's a stable coin um and the usdnc in circulation has been growing all the time as i said i think it's over 40 billion right now so um these anchors as i was saying are both the on and off ramps of value and you can kind of see an example of some of the stellar anchors around the world in this slide so in addition to usdc there are other us dollar stable coins that are issued as well from the u.s as well as argentine pesos there are euros there's nigerian naira philippine pesos um there there are lots more and so especially when um you have this transition between currencies and when one of those currencies is i'll say difficult or less liquid um if you've ever traveled someplace in the world where it was sort of a currency you don't use as much those kinds of currencies have a lot of friction and transition people tend to pay very high fees and so connecting those financial systems with stellar has a huge benefit for the citizens there and those anchors in the local area serve as an on and off ramp for value to the network so they accept the local currency they pay the local currency and then they trans they can onboard it and keep it in that currency or can change on its way um so when they do you have a question let's see another race yeah i had to go ahead generally or like cbdc's um yeah and so i was wondering if a lot of the hype around like crypto is about how it's decentralized but cbdc's are like regulated and issued by like central banks um how do they fit into the picture of like cryptocurrency in general yeah that's a good question um so assets are all are issued assets like stable coins are typically issued by a single source so even um you know center is a consortium of companies but circle is the issuer of usdc so the all the value is sitting in a centralized place i think the difference and what we are trying to push for also with cbdc's is to have them have the ability to move on an open and permissionless network so we care a lot about the network versus the asset issuance i mean it's great it's easy and um and secure and there's a lot of great features issuing assets on stellar we absolutely want people to do that but in terms of our global financial inclusion goals in the space of cbdc's we really want these assets to be changeable and to be able to travel on to be by changeable i mean interoperable so they can travel between geographies and um and to be able to be used by anyone and i think actually central banks want the same thing they want access for everyone that's a it's a large concern they want security they want access we're actually getting ready to um publish a um a study a kind of a deep research paper on cbdc's probably before the end of the year fingers crossed um that anka can definitely hook you up to if you're interested in learning more about the details of policy frameworks for cbdc's it's pretty intricate stuff um any other questions go ahead jump in hi hello um thank you adam um i was just having a question about how the anchor system works um so the way i understand it you go to the anchor with a hundred bucks i'll give it to thank god they gave me back hundred tokens um would these anchors be holding off hundred bucks like in their reserve or would they be uh holding one certain one portion of it and using the rest um for investments like a bank does and is that how they make their fees it's an insightful question yes so most anchors do charge a fee um to convert from the fiat whatever fiat you're giving them to uh the tokenized asset um and they are anchors are regulated financial institutions so while they're um you know across the world for example like a famous um a famous and very criticized stable coin called tether usdt um people are very critical of their reserve of their policies around the reserve and they ask for audits and things like that i think in general blockchain is fairly transparent and companies that um and stellar is this way too very open and transparent about policies and what you know how they manage funds and exactly what their reserves are and where their reserves are um we insist on um companies that become anchors on stellar have to identify themselves they have um you know they're kind of a trusted financial institution in their own market and um they all have to comply with their own local regulations but our expectation is that they are fully reserved assets um we we are an open network and so anyone can use it and it's definitely up to the user and the consumer to make sure that they're making smart decisions um but we really look to hold our anchors to a high bar well then if one of the anchors go down would that mean other anchors have to help save them or is this connected network or are they all by themselves because if they're not they're just like individual banks small banks that just exchange between fifth way off fiat money and tokens everything they are msb so they are money service businesses or fintech so they're like a neobank they're like a bank in their local area for sure they actually act like a local bank so they're prone to the same risks of a bank going bankrupt because of that investments potentially although tokenizing i would say that anchors are the on and off ramp and i would use the word ramp because you don't usually hang out on a ramp right when you go on the highway you get on and you go and you go where you're going and when you get off you get off you don't park on the ramp and stay there so i think most of the time value is moving through the anchor and it's on its way somewhere else so um i think still the majority of the use cases that we're looking at for these kind of cross-border payments they all start in some kind of fiat and end in some kind of fiat um so you know and this can happen in you know seconds or minutes when it arrives at the destination generally speaking people are going to land the value in their bank account for in cash sometimes and so that means the transaction happened and it's done you have your you have your value ready thank you so much ata sure uh no i think i left my hand up just saying okay hi nice to see you again um so yes all of all of the anchors um just to sum up on that question all the anchors are maintaining these fiat reserves once they onboard value to the network um equal to the tokens that they've issued on stellar um and then anytime people redeem or pass to another anchor then that's how the value will move and eventually land and be out again our vision for stellar is this you know better connections better interoperability for a world where you know we see globalization happening um but the access to financial services is still fairly unequal um you know when usdc kind of moves through the economy the underlying dollars are still sitting in the bank but we're enabling all of this commerce there's economic activity people can loan you know tokens to one another there's no intermediaries or banks you know taking a piece of each transaction along the way so there's a lot less friction and we're really envisioning blockchain as enabling this this more connected more interoperable world the next thing so that was all about asset issuance getting value on to the stellar network i'm going to pause here for a second if there's any other questions before we talk about holding and diversifying the value on stellar any other questions all right holding and diversifying value on stellar um you know anyone who has value on the network needs a place to keep track of it um when you move money you're used to this right when using a bank anytime you move money you move it into the bank then you take it out use it or spend it um but accounts on stellar work differently even though we call them accounts um they really are just a marker in the ledger that says what belongs to you so this is and i'm sure billy talked about this too this is distributed ledger technology so on the ledger it says you own this five dollars let's say this five usdc belongs to jim it's in his wallet and everyone knows it's in his wallet because it's on the shared ledger and then when he wants to spend it there's a transaction that sends it from his wallet to someone else's wallet and so um as you might imagine these digital wallets which which are different than a you know a cash wallet that you use um you know unlike a physical wallet they are they don't contain the money they really are just showing you a vision of you know a view of the ledger of where your money is um noted in the ledger and so they don't really store assets but they give you access and they give you the ability to um to control it wallets also connect to anchors so when you do walk in with your cash or send a send a bank transfer to an anchor to get those tokens you need to have a wallet to land that value coming out of the anchor and tokens there are a lot of different wallets um wallets have to be compatible with the blockchains that those assets move on so lobster is an example of a stellar compatible wallet and it gives users access to any asset on stellar so whether you've tokenized a enlightenment card or a bar of gold or or 100 usdc on stellar all of those are available to be seen in a with a lobster wallet and it has a mobile and a web version it's very clean design we really like and recommend lobster and it's also very kind of open-ended so it can be used for all these different kinds of assets [Music] as we look at these fiat currencies and the things that you can do with them in your diversifying value i really love this example of another wallet that is that is purpose-built for a very specific use case um and this wallet is called leaf global leaf runs um it can run on actually a like a low feature phone as well um it's been deployed in kenya rwanda and uganda since uh for about a year september 2020 and it enables people who don't have a bank account don't have an address um and who are completely disconnected from the sort of traditional financial system to hold val hold spend and send value is really designed for refugees uh cross-border traders and the financially marginalized people who for whatever reason cannot get a regular bank account and so it's really accessible um you know everything from the different languages that it has the ways that it identifies people um you would be surprised how difficult it is to pass these traditional what we call kyc know your customer checks um in sort of ordinary financial services and so it's a it is a terrific help for refugees because they also are very vulnerable to um to robbery when they have to carry cash it can be dangerous especially when crossing borders so they really have a safety issue that is solved by the leaf wallet and um and it just it empowers them to hold and keep value when they need it most so once someone has a place to hold value in their wallet then we can think about ways to diversify it there's d stock we talked about equitable access to various kinds of investments earning yield is something that has come into the forefront with all different kinds of crypto but in particular you can earn yield on stable coins and so let's say for example i live in argentina or um or venezuela or zimbabwe or other places that have had severe problems with their currencies um with crypto like with a stable coin i can save in u.s dollars and i can also deposit that in um different kinds of wallets that are in yield so it is such a wonderful hedge against inflation especially i mean we see inflation here i think um the numbers that came out for october were over six percent i think we have right now in the us um 6.2 annualized inflation it's sky high um you know a gallon of milk cost about a dollar in 1968 and today it's almost four dollars so you can see the effects of inflation are dramatic if you don't have your money invested if you're in those marginalized communities where you're not able to invest then you are very vulnerable to inflation and so vibrant is a great example of um in in argentina um and across latin america people can save in u.s dollars and um the banks they're maybe the very wealthy can save in u.s dollars or keep value in us dollars but it's not available to the average person and so vibrant is a super useful app for people to keep value in us dollars and even earn on their balances it's a super easy platform to use and it's built on stellar so finally we're going to talk about sending and exchanging assets i'm really sorry for these jumpy slides um sending and exchanging assets is one of the things that stellar's is uniquely suited to do because of the way it's structured and because it's an open and permissionless network there are lots of pathways how value can move one of the most useful kinds of applications that we see is cross-border payments and remittances because you are able to send send fiat value once it's tokenized on stellar and have it change along the way into another store value so these cross-currency transactions are really very efficient on stellar and part of that is due to what's called a built-in dex so um a dex is a decentralized exchange and what that means is that there's an order book similar to a stock exchange or other kinds of exchanges where assets can be traded for one another based on um a bid and an ask price so this is um just kind of a representation of a typical order book on the decks um we recently released another piece of technology called automated market makers which also allows assets to be changed on the fly and improves the efficiency of stellar um i think when i said you can send currency in one send from one currency to another um that that is kind of a unique thing about stellar and we do it with this thing called a pass payment which can go through the decks or it can go through the amms um the automated market makers and these path payments work um from so if you kind of look at this map they start out they can start out in the philippine peso change to us dollars to lumens or nigerian neighbors and and along the way they can make many hops into different currencies as needed um and land in the value of that the receiver wants both sides only get the currency that they want to deal with sorry lucian's asleep so i think somebody went off mute um but this allows for a lot of flexibility and different use cases on stellar so let's look at a cross-border payments and remittances this is an enormous market 37 trillion in 2020 and 39 trillion by 2026 is predicted um one of the real areas of friction is as i was saying in emerging markets where cross-border payments and remittances can cost 10 percent so the people who need the money the most are actually paying the highest fees for these transactions and you know whether they are migrant workers sending money home businesses paying remote staff suppliers getting paid by customers there's all this friction when transacting between different currencies intermediaries all take a piece and you know starting with the payer's bank and ending in the account of the recipient is usually um many steps each cost some money and time so it tends to be very slow um because of globalization and our you know increasing tendency to do business across borders a lot of fintechs and large multinational companies are looking for new ways to do cross-border payments they're really pushing in this in this regard and um b2b payments are a strong use case on stellar there's there's a lot of this type of transactions on the stellar network here's a look at kind of the existing landscape for payments um so if you're in europe you might use the sepa inside of europe um sepa payments are really you know quick and efficient and cheap but once you want to try to send money overseas then you're riding on swift or some other you know some other um rail if you're inside the us you might use an ach which you know takes a few days but it's pretty dependable pretty cheap um the problem is that none of these payment um kind of systems are interoperable so i can't send a step up payment to an ach recipient in another country and so you know in the 1970s they stood up this system called swift and um it was it stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications so it's kind of a mouthful but swift payments were established out of brussels with certain standards where all these member banks could send money to each other but swift was never really built frankly for individuals it never never served peer-to-peer very well it's pretty slow um and it's a closed system so only banks can participate um you can't have a fintech just jump in and initiate a swift payment they have to use a bank to do it um so sending funds cross-border is usually super slow and incurs a lot of fees so um you know one way that companies deal with this is they just open bank accounts and all the geographies where they do business which can work especially if it's just one or two geographies maybe and it's a very large company you can establish operations and get a bank account wherever it is that you want to land value and then pre-fund your transactions in that geography but now you're holding capital in all these different markets and um and you're also exposing yourself to um forex to currency risk you know between the currencies that you're holding so um you know traditional you know cross-border payments for businesses um can be pretty much a pain i will say you know they they start with this let's say a service provider issues this invoice um and then the customer goes to pay them so they wire their money to a correspondent bank the correspondent bank receives the money sends it to the receiving bank you know so there's a lot of um different steps and some of them are even manual so you have like actual paperwork and things that are seem archaic to us now the typical time to settle a transaction like this is two to five business days depending on the geography and this is counting on having developed pretty much developed countries on both funds fees can run anywhere to five or six percent the way that stellar manages cross-border payments is a little different as you might imagine so still the service provider issues that invoice but instead the customer pays an anchor in their home currency so the anchor is responsible for onboarding that value and sending it to an anchor in the destination country and then that anchor in the destination country pays out the fiat value in the local currency to the receiving bank so here you have a frictionless blockchain based pathway for payments with local partners to provide the on and off ramps for fiat and the effect is the same it's just a lot cheaper and a lot faster still the service provider is paying and the receiving bank is receiving for for the supplier but there's no intermediary bank fees in all of these steps and they're all dealing in their local currencies as well so the this kind of replaces the process of the international wire and the currency conversion in a single pathway d transfer is an example of an app that allows companies to do this and kind of shows the pathway along the way for b2b payments between currencies their fees are something like one-tenth of a traditional bank and so it's a pretty high utility um it's connected to banking networks in europe the us mexico brazil tanzania expanding through europe asia africa and the americas now click pesa is another example that deals with the intra-african the high fees inside africa so i think i mentioned a fee of 10 in africa um paying between countries in africa can be is definitely in the double digits it can be 15 fees 18 fees um between african countries and so click pesa gives companies that operate in africa the ability to accept payments online in a b2b payment platform and provides the on and off ramps for tanzanian and kenyon banks finally remittances we're going to talk about um the remittance market which is um you know a very high impact area for financial inclusion because many um many countries in the world have a large percentage of their gdp coming in in remittances their families all over the globe that depend on remit says for to survive to live and each year about half a trillion dollars of value is transferred cross-border through personal remittances um in most cases they're small they're you know 200 to 500 and they average cost is somewhere around seven percent um in in between developing economies like i was mentioning in africa they'll be over 10 typically um so you have traditional money transfer organizations um but they're not as efficient as they could be they're not as fast as they could be and with you know the insertion of correspondent banks and kind of the older payment rails um there's definitely a lot of opportunities for improvement and so we really see this stellar powered remittances as a huge advantage um these are just a couple tempo and arf that enable remittances um tempo is located in paris and arf is in istanbul and they enable remittances to happen in a much more seamless way across europe and tempo has other pathways to to africa an additional location so it's really pretty exciting to see these remittance use cases come to life finally i'm going to show you one of our most exciting developments at stellar is the use of moneygram so you may be who's heard of moneygram curious it's a it's a pretty large business but they're primarily um involved so here's a couple people who have heard of the company moneygram so they are a money services business that allows people to send money around the globe typically person to person and um so what we've done with moneygram in this recent partnership is connected digital wallets to moneygrams so that people have a pathway for cash in and cash out using the money gram physical locations and the value moves on stellar and what's really cool about this is you have people who need to receive money in cash for example in latin america because that's how they primarily you know live and transact um but they may not have a bank account so they might not have a way to get the cash out and so using these money transfer services we're able to leverage moneygrams retail locations along with the efficiency and speed of the stellar network to get remittances get cash in the hands of people much faster the partnership just started and so there's going to be a pilot and i'll actually um i'll mention in case anka hasn't already that um we're going to be giving a demo and a lot more information about this partnership at our conference called meridian which is completely free um it's november 17th and 18th next week so if you're interested in um stellar technology and you know we have debates and there's a lot of interesting stuff feel free to register um you're all invited to attend and um and of course stay in touch and depending on your interests too if you have more technical interests or more business oriented interests there are kind of different tracks um so there's two days of um you know presentations and opportunities to interact with with sdf um we like to think of our our ecosystem we call it an ecosystem right because there are companies sdf is really just here to support and foster the stellar network but now there are all these companies all over the world that are plugged in and we see this as an approach of driving global financial inclusion rooted in global collaboration and so all of these companies whether they are wallets exchanges money transfer businesses payments businesses wallets they're all they're all participating um in this ecosystem and whether businesses focus on one use case or they combine different use cases together to meet the needs of their target customers there's just a lot of innovation going on on stellar you know we're always getting new features and that's why i encourage you to attend meridian and find out more about it so these are just an example of of some of the businesses that are part of the stellar ecosystem today it's like watching a show there we go these companies are located all over the world and so this this global ecosystem has evolved to serve a lot of different needs uncle do you want me to talk briefly about um stellar quest and the community fund or do you want to talk about that since it is your area of expertise um sure yeah let me uh let me let me um do you want to put up the slide sure i'm glad too so this is totally cool go ahead yeah sure thing so um yeah so stellar quest telequest is a fun way and gamified way to learn tech of stellar um so currently like if you sign up uh you can go through practice challenges that makes it easy to kind of learn the tech of stellar and you don't need to know how to code so while doing it while completing these fun quests you can earn rad like collect red nfts and also during live series you can collect earn excellent so it's actually very fun uh next slime is the native currency of stellar um i definitely recommend anyone who is like watching this to go to quest.org at least go through the first year seriously how you feel because then you get really like oh this is how ledger works and you'll actually work with tools that we call the laboratory where you can submit uh transactions directly to the blockchain so yeah very exciting and then you get a good feel of how things are looking um yeah so i guess we can go to the seller community fund as well yes i will eventually turn this slide sorry about that yeah so you know if you do enjoy like building on stellar and i think like you know jim also mentioned having some kind of hackathon at some point i think uh you should definitely check out communityfun.seller.org it's an open application grant program for stellar-based projects really to like you can build and grow your project and then submit it to the scf and then we also have a really vibrant discord community where you can go in and also check out all the other projects uh currently like our submission deadline is november 21st which is obviously coming up but uh definitely after about i think like november 24th you can check out uh this rounds selects and uh yeah check out what people are all building so um community fun is really cool because the community itself votes on which projects they like best and so while stf like we provide the funds the uh communicate community allocates it so it's a really investing in the community's vision um that was it for me thanks so much thanks thank you so much anka um so stellar.org is really the place to learn all about everything that's going on at stellar from news to developer relations um there's a pretty large knowledge base there that talks about all these different use cases there's cool videos all kinds of things so yeah i invite you to access stellar.org anytime and learn more about stellar's open network for storing and moving money
