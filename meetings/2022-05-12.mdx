- uh hey everyone welcome to the stellar protocol discussion for may 12 2022.
- um in these meetings we discuss and plan for upcoming changes to versions of the stellar protocol changes that are necessary to evolve the protocol to meet ecosystem needs i'm just real quick a word on on venue um uh you know last week we tried having this discussion in the stellar developer discord and there were some technical issues so we're back to live streaming this on youtube um you know we just don't want to let the technical issues of a platform prevent us from having these discussions so that we can talk about the substance and keep moving forward we may experiment with other venues um in the future but you know we'll make sure to stress test platforms so there's just not technical glitches that prevent the conversation from happening um that said uh we are discussing this week some caps that are related to project jump cannon which is uh the an announcement that we made earlier this year that we are working to bring uh smart contracts to stellar and as part of that there are protocol changes that need to happen it's been a bit different this time because we've sort of modularized those changes into a series of core advancement proposals each of which focuses on a specific aspect or specific type of change that needs to happen to accommodate smart contracts now if you're watching this right now it's a technical discussion so i advise looking at the links in the show notes which are the actual links to the core advancement proposals that we're going to discuss and to the discussions that exist on the stellar dev mailing list which is where sort of long form question and answers happen in addition to the stellar debt mailing list there's also the stellar dev discord and there's a jump cannon and a jump can and dev channel in there and anyone can join either of those uh forums in order to like see the discussion unfold or participate in the discussion uh we're doing this in the open so that you know you can sort of see the work happening or and also so that you can have a voice in the changes as we make them so that said there are a number of caps that are on the table right now that relate to smart contracts into jump cannon and we discussed a few of them last week i think this week we're going to start out by talking about some of the classic smart interoperability questions that remain uh most of which have to do with cat 48 and cat 49 that are kind of two different flavors of how to approach that and as as recently as this morning there was some interesting discussion on the mailing list about that and so i think we start there um and i think i don't know john john do you want to start um um honestly i'd rather just let eco start i mean nico posted this huge thing with a bunch of questions and i responded to it um so like it's kind of niko's turn to talk in the sense that i'm i'm the most recent speaker on the thread so uh maybe we can just kind of go through and we can try to figure out basically just kind of talk through some of these questions and understand what we're actually talking about and make sure we're on the same page on a variety of different things and if we're not on the same page get on the same page that sounds good wall of text yeah uh sorry yeah so i guess like maybe uh i don't know like uh one of the things we can talk about is actually around compliance because i think that's actually the most important bit uh that that is in there okay um i mean like i'm i think we we should discuss potentially changing i mean maybe not this time around but like you know that this is like in there's an uh level of expectation in terms of on the compliance front that uh i think we should maybe um adjust even in classic so that we can make things work for for john cannon so like the type of things i'm talking about here is that both proposals kind of suffer from the same problem um so today uh if you have an asset that you issued on on the seller network um and you like our version basically we only have like a couple of smart contracts basically on today right like we have emms and the decks those are like the kind of equivalent and today we track uh if you have like money uh or any asset locked into a contract it's going to be um recovered basically uh when you your authorization gets revoked and i think this breaks completely in jump cannon because well that's actually not well if we don't do anything right like uh like because the only thing that gets really revoked is uh is your trust line like the ground of your trust line uh like you you lose access to your wallet but if you uh parked uh your your money in some smart contract that is the uh uh you know like the uh i know shady guy on the corner basically uh there's no way to to enforce anything there so so then the question is like well what do we do um because if you don't do anything in both proposals we're basically saying well you know if you want to get around any kind of restrictions just you know send your money to this smart contract over there and then it's like this super mixer or something and then uh like you can you can't reasonably have enforcement um so maybe we can start with that like we can say well that's okay that's the new new reality and then my uh then i would argue that we should just stop doing what we are doing in classic like or at least say that we are going to stop doing you know recover basically like uh assets from from from pools or from our other decks uh like if you know because that's actually a lot of of the overhead that we have today in classic so i'll start with that like uh i don't know what people think so i can just start with saying what how i responded to your question to the same question from the email thread which was basically like this does work in cap 48 and cap 49.

Jump Cannon dominated this protocol call. The team dug into how CAP-0048 and CAP-0049 should let classic assets flow through Soroban contracts without weakening the compliance guarantees that anchors rely on. Most of the debate focused on the tradeoffs between usability and safety when issuers revoke authorization, freeze trustlines, or claw back balances that a contract is holding on behalf of users.

Key discussion threads:

- How issuers can chase funds through downstream contracts when a participant attempts to dodge KYC freezes, and whether that burden should fall on protocol defaults or on contract-specific guard rails.
- Implications of mutable vs. immutable Soroban contracts, and whether developers must implement cleanup hooks so that clawbacks and freezes do not permanently brick liquidity pools.
- Ideas for gating “dangerous” assets (auth required, clawback enabled, etc.) until a future phase, while the group gains confidence in interoperability patterns between classic accounts and contracts.
