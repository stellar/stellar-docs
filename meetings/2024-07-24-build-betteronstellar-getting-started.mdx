- hear me um my name is Julia Martinez senior developer Advocate and I'm super excited to get today's session kicked off where we will be learning the ins and outs of Russ smart contract development so I'll go ahead and kick it off with a quick introduction again my name is Julian Martinez senior developer Advocate and Common Man here at the Stellar development foundation once again over the next uh I guess half an hour to an hour or so depending on how you guys are feeling we're going to dive into some uh basic smart contract development and we may even scale it up to maybe getting into a staking smart contract uh just kind of depends on how the flow goes all right so first things first we're going to go ahead and dive into a great online IDE tool here it's called okashi um again okashi is an online IDE it's really good for uh iterating on your smart contract ideas um it's got a cool code window where you can type in all your syntax uh there's the contract window where you can actually call the functions um related to the uh smart contract that you've just you just coded there's also a console window here uh that shows the output of the smart contract calls or the function calls rather um so if you'd like to follow along you can actually scan this QR code and as I'm updating the smart contract online you should be able to see um uh the smart contract being updated on your local machine as well so what I'm going to do here is bring okashi to my main screen you should be able to see it here all right so uh this is okashi again uh we have the code window ready for all the syntax and um you know this is where the bulk of your your logic will live for your smart contracts uh we have the contract window which is going to hold all the functions and will allow you to you know execute and invoke different functions that live on that contract and you have your console window here which is just going to Output uh the I guess or it's going to show the return data of the function call itself um all right so let's go ahead and dive into rust and sorond if you don't already know sorond is Stellar's smart contract platform um so a few things here uh first things first you see the flag nod that is to tell the compiler to not use Russ standard Library uh sorb on Smart contracts this flag and optimize for smaller contracts so they don't take up take up as much space on The Ledger this makes for uh you know good good forward term thinking for things like State bloat and overall just being mindful of uh not taking up more space and storage than you need to uh because in the future it can lead to bottlenecks and user experience and overall just uh becomes IM manageable uh so you see here on line three you sorbon SDK this is because uh sorbon uses a special dialect of rust uh with dedicated data types and some special attributes so uh we're importing a couple of attributes here namely contract contract implementation uh the N data type symbol string and symbol short now let's go ahead and cover a few of these uh these two attributes reg are uh mainly pertain to telling the compiler to treat all the following syntax as a contract would be treated so um when it comes to the contract implementation it exposes all the publicly facing functions to the environment uh for processing through different mechanisms like testing uh static uh envir static function testing Etc so uh with EnV this data type is going to be responsible for accessing smart smart contract storage within the contract itself as well as uh data from The Ledger um so you'll see how we use this a little bit later when we're creating a key value uh kind of like storage mechanism for the smart contract symbol now symbol is a I don't want to say it's another term for string um but you can think of it as a string so there are two types of symbols uh short symbol which is a string of up to nine characters and then long symbol which is a string of up to 32 characters but the difference here is that long symbols actually require you to pass in the N data type before constructing them here on the next data type we have the string string is exactly what it sounds like um here it's going to be a concatination of letters uh symbol short is a function that we use to kind of just quickly create short symbols in this case we're going to create a short symbol for the word title now you see here on line five const title symbol equals symbol short title um we're just going to use this as kind of like a label for the key value system that we're about to set up so again you see const title symbol equals symbol short and then we're using the word title all right uh here on line seven you see the contract attribute followed by line eight Pub struct title contract so we're creating an empty struct and all sorond smart contracts will follow a similar pattern you see a contract attribute the empty struct with the name of the contract itself and Then followed by a contract implementation attribute and then the implementation of the actual contract so let's go ahead and start writing some functions here this is our title contract and the main purpose of this is to uh kind of illustrate the key value system when it comes to storage so I'm going to create a value uh for a key and then I'm going to go ahead and well I'm going to create the key value get her and Setter so we're going to be able to set a value to a key then we're going to be able to retrieve that value from a key so let's go ahead and say Pub function we're going to say set title this is going to take in two arguments we're going to say m of the type n we're going to take in a string and this is going to be for the title value we're not going to return anything so we'll go ahead and get right into the logic again referring back to the n data type up here you see M storage we have to go instance do set and then we're going to uh actually if you see set we're going to say set and title and then we're going to bring the argument from the title uh or bring in the argument title in from the uh the functions here or the uh the argument here so let's go ahead and compile this let's see if this works again you see and storage we're taking in the uh we're taking in the or we're accessing the smart contract storage here uh we have instance which is a certain type of data uh type for sorbon smart contracts of which there are three temporary persistent and instance and then you see the set method here where we're actually setting a value to the title uh to the title key and then the value will be title but it looks like we have some errors here unused variable signature length unused variable signature little literal cannot find type title in this scope okay public function string title and storage okay we got some we got some issues here so let's see what we got H so this looks like it was compiled function set title all right I'm just going to go ahead and do a quick sanity check I do have the correct function on the side here I'm also wondering if this is going to work all right let's go ahead and see what the issue was in the last set title and title okay not sure what the issue was here but let's go ahead and let's see if we can actually uh debug it side by side let's go ahead and find the difference see this see if this compiles it probably won't [Music] okay well I'm not sure what the issue was here but um long story short here is the correct function as you can see we see uh Pub function set title uh we're taking in two arguments one is the data type n uh the next is the data type string uh for our title uh we're accessing the smart contract storage Again by typing m.
- storage.

On July 24, 2024, the Stellar Development Foundation hosted "Build #BetterOnStellar: Getting Started in Rust", a community session for the global community. Builders traded notes on Betteronstellar, Getting, and Started.

hear me um my name is Julia Martinez senior developer Advocate and I'm super excited to get today's session kicked off where we will be learning the ins and outs of Russ smart contract development so I'll go ahead and kick it off with a quick introduction again my name is Julian Martinez senior developer Advocate and Common Man here at the Stellar development foundation once again over the next uh I guess half an hour to an hour or

Key discussion threads:

- Betteronstellar anchored the community session as speakers compared real-world examples.
- Practical demos highlighted how Getting applies to Stellar builders.
- Attendees outlined next steps around Started for upcoming releases.
