1. Kirckz discusses Meru, a Financial services app for Freelancers and remote workers in Latin America. [The slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fu4AkB0mrvOkK6UDFJHgKwCV-Ul4JRF-xPqTYJ3CQqw) detail how Meru stitches USD accounts, Blend, and its own anchoring stack into a non-custodial offering: clients get invoices, virtual cards, and local withdrawals while Meru sponsors fees and integrates with Blend for yield.

- Meru gives freelancers a USD bank account that connects to platforms such as Upwork/Deel, lets them hold dollars, issue invoices, and withdraw locally (including via MoneyGram partnerships).
- The team tackled wallet fee-bumping, passkey recovery, and Blend integration (Node/Python/Rust backend, Flutter/React frontend, SNS/SQS event architecture) to sponsor XLM fees and handle SEP-30 recovery.
- They plan to surface DeFi yield via Blend primitives, leaning on audited tooling, RPC definitions, and SDKs (`stellar_flutter_sdk` + `blend-sdk-js`) for a developer-friendly rollout.
