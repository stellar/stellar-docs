- hey everyone welcome to the open protocol meeting sorry for the slightly late start just a quick technical glitch as per usual um so the stellar protocol meeting in these meetings we discuss and plan for uh upcoming changes to the stellar protocol and today we're going to talk about something very exciting project jump cannon which is going to bring smart contracts to stellar um so just quick intro as most of you know stellar was launched in 2014.
- at the time there was a very deliberate design decision to keep things simple right so only support a fixed repertoire of transactions but at this point after a ton of feedback from the ecosystem it's clear there's a need for more flexibility so developers they're interested in building applications they're relying on submitting custom turing complete contra code right to run in the transaction execution phase of the network so essentially people want smart contracts so in march we officially kicked off project jump cannon and there's a link to the announcement in the meeting description and after a very thorough examination of the existing smart contract landscape we made a decision to build it on a webassembly run times wasm for short so if you want to know more about the selection process there's also a link to a blog called project jump canon choosing wasm and that will sort of help walk through that decision the evaluation that led us to where we are today but today we're actually going to start to get into the protocol changes necessary to like accommodate that decision so we're going to start by talking about the core advancement proposal cap 46 webassembly smart contract runtime environment which as you can probably guess by the title um specifies the lowest level code execution and data model components of a wasm-based smart contract system for the stellar network um once we talk about cap 46 we'll also start to ask some general questions about how smart contracts should interoperate with the network this is as per usual a technical discussion so if you want to keep up i suggest taking a look at the cap as well as the discussion thread about it those are both linked to in a meeting description and then if you're interested you can also join the conversation about smart contracts you can do that by participating in that thread that's linked to here or by joining the stellar developer discord which is where we're having all the jump cannon discussions so that the work is open the participatory we're doing you know can really follow along on the stellar developer discord okay cap 46.

This Jump Cannon kickoff focused on CAP-0046, the Wasm smart-contract runtime vocabulary. Grzegorz and the core team explained why the CAP looks unusual: it introduces the types, host objects, and XDR scaffolding that Soroban will lean on without yet wiring them into any user-facing transaction. Establishing that common language now keeps the follow-on caps smaller and lets client teams prototype against a stable ABI.

They also unpacked the host/guest split, detailing how contracts run in a deterministic guest environment while Stellar Core enforces resource limits, storage access, and serialization in the host. That discussion covered the value type hierarchy, how immutable objects flow across the boundary, and why the data model needs to be generic enough for future fee schedule updates.

Key discussion threads:

- CAP-0046 as a building block: defining XDR for Wasm entries, handles, and host functions while deferring transaction plumbing to later caps.
- The host-versus-guest contract boundary and how deterministic execution depends on a clear line between developer code and Stellar Core.
- Structuring SCVal and companion types so contracts can exchange complex data without breaking compatibility with existing ledger serialization rules.
