## [Public Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1219381314931917000)

This session focused on improving visibility and introspection around Soroban transactions and smart contracts. The discussion explored how richer transaction metadata can unlock better analytics, tooling, and developer understanding of on-chain behavior without changing contract semantics.

A major theme was contract discovery: making it easier to identify, authenticate, and reason about deployed contracts by standardizing metadata and exposing it through existing and future RPC interfaces. The group also connected these ideas to fee mechanics, emphasizing transparency around inclusion fees and trade-offs.

### Key Topics

- Transaction metadata enhancements
  - Proposal to expand TX meta to improve visibility and analytics
  - How richer metadata can support explorers, indexers, and developer tooling
- Read-only contract invocations
  - Explanation of read-only calls that guarantee no state changes
  - Motivation for safely querying contract state and behavior
  - Ongoing protocol discussions on enforcement and semantics
- Contract discovery
  - Motivation to improve visibility and authenticity of deployed contracts
  - Need to help developers and users identify what a contract is and where it came from
- Standardized contract metadata
  - Proposal to adopt a common contract metadata schema
  - Linking deployed contracts to source code and descriptive information
  - Use of `contractmeta` to embed metadata at build time
- Fees and inclusion cost visibility
  - Discussion of inclusion fees and surge pricing behavior
  - Importance of monitoring fees and understanding trade-offs in transaction submission
- RPC improvements
  - Early plans for a new RPC endpoint
  - Goal: provide better guidance and observability around inclusion fees
  - Enable developers to make informed decisions when setting fees
