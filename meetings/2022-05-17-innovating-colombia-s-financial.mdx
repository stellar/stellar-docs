- okay i think that we can we can start again uh good morning everyone in latin america welcome to today's panel that we call it innovating colombian financial system i'm gabriel bisama i lead international policy at the stellar development foundation and today we have three experienced panelists that we are going to discuss the opportunities and challenges of using blockchain technology for cross-border payments and specifically what we are going to discuss is how the use of blockchain technology and stablecoins can expand the access and usage of affordable financial services and how actually they could provide a positive impact to inclusion and economy by contributing reducing the cost of cross-border payments so i think that everyone here that connect to this panel they know that the average uh cost of of cross-border payments remains very high right now uh so it amounts to almost six percent of the amount that you send which is more than the double of the um sustainable development goals target that is actually three percent uh so so this high cost of remittances payments have real world impacts on individuals and small businesses so for example high costs impact migrants seeking to some money home for for their families also small businesses important products uh from foreign suppliers and uh non-profit organizations such as eight organizations that are actually there this person uh fans for humanitarian aid so blockchain technology and and the responsible design and use of of stable coins could enable more affordable cross-border payments including remittances but also b2b payments that finalize in in seconds and and actually cause fractions of a cent uh mainly due to the reduction of of intermediation so today we are going to get into the details of on on a project that we are doing in in colombia with two ecosystem partners of of the stellar development foundation uh and also we will have um diana from from the latin american development bank uh to speak a little bit about how to embed financial education into the consumer experience but before getting into uh the details and discussions with with the panelists i just want to give you a brief overview and intro to the stellar network for those who are not familiar with with it uh so stellar is an open blockchain with control capabilities for for issuers and what does this mean so actually is uh is a blockchain is a network that actually gives on the one hand controls to asset issuers that ensures safety and security of a permission or closed network but at the same time it leverage openness and interpretivity uh that foster competition innovation and inclusion and uh the some examples of this just to give you some some clear examples is is aml and cft features and and clovax so something that is called authorization require is is a flag that it could be when you when an asset is your issues an asset it could uh he could make sure that that it has this aml and cfd feature that ensures that a financial entity when he's distributing an asset identifies who is the holder of that asset and this would uh gives controls to actually to the issuer that that aml and cft regulations are being comply with uh so so we think that aml and cft is important but also clawbacks are important so if an asset issuer such as a regulated financial entity or a fintech or a digital wallet or even a central bank that issues a cbdc actually include this this flag on on the asset uh gives the possibility of uh to the issuer to recover the funds in the event of a fraud for example uh but this is not only relevant because of in the case of fraudulent transactions but also is relevant if for example any a user loss lose the the private keys so we think that that clawbacks are really important and just to step back a little bit and someday downstair uh it was established in in 2014 and so so actually it's one of the blockchains uh that is most established and it's designed or it was designed for for payments like the main use case right now on on seller is crossword payments but also we are working in other use cases such as cbdc's and uh using blockchain for distributing humanitarian aid uh since it launched the network process more than 2.6 billion transactions and currently is processing more than six million transactions in a day-to-day basis uh the other piece that is important if you would like to promote the use of blockchain technology that could uh as well promote financial inclusion we need to make sure that the technology is sustainable so one of the things that we would like to make sure is actually that the technology yeah it doesn't consume a lot of energy so we are in in the next couple of weeks we are going to to publish some research on on the energy consumption on standard and the data is is really promising so that is something that we are we are really happy of uh and it is supported by the sera development foundation which mission is to promote the access and use of financial services and actually the foundation is a non-profit organization uh and uh is is uh it's not a charity actually it pays taxes in the u.s specifically in california and uh the whole goal of the of of the foundation is to support the development of the network so with that i think that we can we can start but before starting actually uh this panel is is in led up to the textured startup weekend blockchain mexico city that is uh that is going to happen uh next weekend and actually this is an event that brings together the the community in latin america that is building uh solutions uh in finance but but not only on stellar in any blockchain so actually we are inviting those developers and startups and fintechs and others that actually are building products in latin america and if you have a good idea to solve uh any problem uh for for the target audience that that we work in terms of payments uh you are more than invited to attend uh in person or even virtually the uh the hackathon so actually there you have the link to to sign up so feel free to uh to do it and if you have any questions you can you can ask me or anki after after after this this panel so with that i think that now we are ready to to start the the discussion so uh first of all i would like to uh i would ask uh ivan to uh to introduce himself himself and and also provide a brief overview of unclapped and what is what is doing in latin america and specifically in colombia hey gabriel how are you how are you all thank you for for joining us uh yeah i am working in in a club here in in latin america we are we are connecting all latin american countries to the the stellar uh network uh through establishment we issue uh establishment for every currency every latin american currency uh so people could access to these global payment networks not only people but also any platform any business that needs or that finds an opportunity here to to transact worldwide uh i like the speed and almost free uh cool who could get that uh that that that tax is really really fast so we are we are working we started in argentina we we are working in in colombia and also in peru and we are under our road map is to to work on on other countries within this this latin america region so that is that is what is what we do uh we we are connecting every single latin american country to this global payment network thank you very much for that uh iman we are going to get into the titles of what unclub is doing specifically in colombia but thank you very much for the intro i mean do you want to introduce yourself and and provide a brief overview of inclusive and its products absolutely thank you very much for having us and it's great to be here with yvonne and the stellar team as well and we're really excited about pursuing the partnership to connect latime countries and the cross-border payments space weave inclusive you can see from our name we are all about financial inclusion and share that mission with don klopsteller and the ecosystem we are a hybrid fintech and regtech platform where we provide a full stack financial crimes compliance or anti-money laundering platform that enables all of the essential know your customer know your business uh anti-money laundering anti-fraud controls transaction monitoring and the like in one workflow and it's built to enable both traditional financial services companies compliance needs as well as decentralized financial services including blockchain ecosystems like the stellar network so we enable a number of other anchors across the platform uh globally to ensure that there's a consistent approach for know your customer anti-money laundering with our global framework we you can think of us as a organ orchestration layer that brings under one roof is to do everything from identity verification and validation legal entity verification and validation across the globe as other anchors and nodes on the stellar blockchain originate their clients either retail individuals or business clients that need to have these essential kyc kyb elements in place and then the associated transaction monitoring and other pieces of the anti-money laundering stack importantly we are very excited about our partnership with stellar because they recognize that there is a need for a consistency of approach in the anti-money laundering framework as many jurisdictions have different rules governing we are built to the global standards of the financial action task force and many in our company are actually former global regulators whether they be with the us or others by my part for example i spent the early part of my career at the u.s treasury department working with institutions like the fatf on anti-money laundering frameworks so the advent of the stellar ecosystem and blockchain enabling tools that that facilitate a much faster efficient cross-border payments ecosystem is exciting in that regard but they all need compliance in that regard we therefore are also an anchor on the stellar blockchain and and the fintech side is we provide connectivity for those payments into the us uh traditional banking and payments ecosystem ach payments wire payments and the like so we can connect with yvonne's team and the customers that they are working with to facilitate cross-border payments for household remittances small business payments and the like and enable on and off ramping for assets that are transacted on the stellar blockchain for example like usdc that may come inbound to counterparts to be paid in the u.s where we can then off-ramp to the u.s payment system and then push or pull funds using ach or wires and as well as outbound flows as well so we we perform two key functions we're a gateway uh between traditional financial and banking ecosystems in the united states to be able to hold funds in accounts with our partner banks in the u.s access those ach and wire rails and then be able to on and off ramp for payments using the global stellar blockchain ecosystem and working with partners like yvonne to really connect the latin american business and household community in their cross-border payments needs and by doing so we enable a very consistent approach by also providing some proprietary capabilities around compliance backed digital identity credentials for clients that come into the ecosystem that provides great efficiencies when we do kyc support because of these often are very redundant so we can issue and validate uh compliance-backed verifiable digital credentials for clients within that ecosystem so as different nodes originate their clients they can have one kyc gateway and be able to have a utility in the ecosystem while importantly also protecting their privacy and so the combination of these compliance tools with the the blockchain elements that associate payments flows between digital assets and fiat assets with this on and off ramp capability is where we sit and we're excited about uh participating in growing the ecosystem and really driving cross-border payments in a much more efficient but also secure and compliant way you very much for that uh amir and inclusivis is a really good example on on how um financial entities are connected to stellar i actually care a lot about aml cfd and compliance so i'm really happy to to to to hear uh all of all that i mean is going to to tell us today so moving forward diana do you want to introduce yourself and uh provide a beef overview of like half i think that most of the audience uh would know the the cafe but it would be great to hear that from you yeah thank you uh gabriella thank you for for the invitation to participate in the webinar um caf is a development back uh the development bank of latin america and uh we we are committed to improving the quality of life of all latin america's latin americans and caribbeans and our cap actions promote sustainable development and the integration of the region and we support uh we provide uh financial support and consulting services to both uh the public and private sectors in our shell shareholder countries uh which are uh 20 countries uh 18 countries in latin america and the caribbean plus spain and portugal in addition we generate a knowledge to strengthen our public policies in latin america and the caribbean in order to improve the quality and impact of the projects that we promote um i i actually uh work as the coordinator of the uh financial inclusion program which is a program uh within uh the uh private sector efforts that uh cafe is is working uh with uh all the countries uh in latin america and the caribbean thank you very much for that brief overview uh diana and it's it's a pleasure having you here as well and i'm making sure that you are involved in the project from a financial inclusion and also from a financial education standpoint that is that is something that uh that that is that is really important for us so um after this quick introductions i think that we can start with with the panel and we can get into the details on on the project that we are doing in colombia and just to give you a brief overview of that uh what we are uh doing with with unclap and amp inclusive is try to under pile up project try to gather data on how much is the cost of sending uh funds across water using uh the stellar blockchain um and uh we we are really happy to see the results after that in in terms of of the pricing and and the potential savings that actually someone sending money from from the us and someone receiving money from colombia uh can uh can can make uh use in uh using blockchain so um actually with this background i have the first question for for you uh amid is actually what do you think that are the benefits and opportunities of using blockchain and stablecoins for cross-border payments for someone who is living in the u.s and and is willing to send money to latin america for example to to colombia thank you very much for the question um the core really comes down to three benefits um cost efficiency as well as security right um the ability to leverage uh stable coins like usdc over the stellar blockchain enable near real-time payments between anchors on the blockchain on the ecosystem and those anchors connect directly to their clients and those clients can be individuals that hold wallets they're operating with a native application to a fintech provider in that home country life inclusive uh is doing for businesses and others in the us and onclop is doing across latam um the ability to on-ramp to usdc from local uh fiat currencies or quite frankly any other asset that's issued and transacted um whether they be stable coins or all coins on stellar provides a tremendous amount of efficiency so you can go from fiat to stable coin back to fiat in many ways much faster than you can send an international wire payment between two intermediaries that are then representing multiple banks or others between the ultimate client sender and ultimate beneficiary recipient and so you get both the the the speed and efficiency associated with that the cost efficiencies that are therefore enabled can streamline this because when you go through multiple intermediaries multiple correspondent banks with three five seven plus day settlement times you not only lose time to get that uh what what may be a small dollar payment for a household or even a large transaction value payment for a non-profit that is trying to provide organizations in need for humanitarian relief or corporates and legal entities trying to make payroll payments supply chain payments vendor payments and others you get a speed and efficiency as well as a cost advantage lastly and importantly the blockchain's underlying attributes give us certain capabilities from a security and compliance perspective the commitment to risk and compliance within the context of the stellar ecosystem uh helps benefit that while because we provide essential kyc kyb elements know your customer know your business elements and therefore issue unique digital credentials what that enables is that in individual uh context in those countries when they onboard a client an individual and they go through the identity verification document non-documentary background sanction screening processes many of these are very piecemeal and we can consolidate them through the inclusive ecosystem they it we can issue these credentials and now any node that is therefore needing to validate an individual or a business that's been onboarded and run through that kyc kyb process can do so near instantaneously and that is a significant hurdle both from an efficiency and cost perspective because anti-money laundering elements tend to be expensive and tend to be very redundant so this provides a an answer to the redundant applications of aml and kyc while also creating security by enabling these verifiable credentials that protect underlying privacy information whereas in the traditional financial services context when a sender sends money through multiple intermediaries to a recipient in a foreign country you have to disclose underlying account and personal information through that payment chain and one is able to do so now con um in in adherence to those compliance rules without having to attach the the very underlying privacy information and because the ledger is immutable you can search both transactions uh from an anti-fraud anti-money laundering perspective as well as ensure that there's no illicit activity that's happening in the system so the immutability of the ledger the transparency that it provides while also cr creating a privacy protection layer is inherently part and parcel of blockchain technology when combined in this ecosystem like through the stellar development foundation support of the stellar network and companies like uh like on klopp and inclusive now you get connectivity uh between asset issuance payments and the interconnectivity between stable coins and fiat currencies in multiple markets with the kyc anti-money laundering layer so net result is you get security speed and efficiency that's great um from a colombian perspective so actually someone who is receiving funds from the u.s to colombia ivan what do you think that are the main benefits of using uh blockchain and also stable coins for cross-border payments ah the the benefits amit has has saw a lot of the benefits and i deeply agree on what he said but i see here i see that this technology the honor from services that we provide the whole ecosystem and the protection that tools that uh inclusive is bringing to the to the to the network uh allows not only to receive uh to receive money for uh remittance but also to small business to transact worldwide i mean uh this is this is technology that not only allow us to help those people that couldn't or doesn't have access to to financial services or are paid too much for for getting money from abroad uh but also to small businesses to start uh offering their products and service uh to to other countries uh in in colombia the the uh on like others com other countries of the region of the latin region argentina and others uh the necessity is clear uh because of the lack of formal jobs there are a huge cash network that probably and that's also something that we should work on uh it's it's it's something that hurts the the people economy maybe if you are not if you don't have the enough financial education and that is where we want to to to work here uh maybe you don't realize how much how are you are you losing using uh traditional rights or maybe you are used to use that rights but using this technology using this uh this network uh it could benefit people not only to get uh get money from a relative in the u.s uh faster and cheaper but also to to start uh working on their personal economy i mean how to use money how to save how to how to uh how how you could offer your personal services like i don't know you could you could go through um i don't know a ternary or to a live streamer a gamer and this phrase this blockchain race allow people to start transacting worldwide but using our domestic currency uh or or the currency you want but at the end of the day if you when you need to consume and use local financial services for local payments or or whatever you need uh there is there is a way to to interact with between the the digital network and the the local financial system uh and that that is what we do we will represent the local currency and allow people to move from one world to the other world easily so i think i'm i'm pretty sure that uh there is a this is a next uh next job charter in our in our region uh when when talking about financial services and on financial opportunities for people but i i also like i look i also want to highlight the the benefits that small businesses or or freelancers or self-employed people could be benefit of this entire network not only people who are receiving money from abroad but also to to develop your economy as a and integrate yourself and provide your services worldwide and i think that is huge probably and i'm sure we have to we we have to uh work really hard on financial education that is a must to have here uh but this technology and this ecosystem uh have a lot to to to to do with people and as soon as the people start seeing and feeling the benefits of all this network sooner or later they will become more familiar with it and of course that that is a process and we start trying to demonstrate that using this this blockchain rails for for transacting and for using your money on and accessing financial services uh it's the first step for a huge other opportunities in a next few years this is really interesting thank you very much for that ivana and i think that you touch upon uh different uh issues that i would like to ask to to the anna in terms of personal finance and financial education so we we have spoken a lot about benefits and opportunities uh but in this context we're actually in order to send money for example from the u.s to colombia you need maybe a smartphone you need connectivity uh how how do you think that financial education and financial literacy and also digital literacy is relevant for for someone who is receiving money in in colombia and and how would you approach actually financial education in this context yes uh thank you gabriel um i think that uh we need to think to think uh first um uh what is financial education uh because um i mean just uh traditionally uh financial education programs have been built on the assumption that uh transferring uh information to financial consumers about how to use financial products would lead to better choices and improved uh financial health however uh evidence from numerous uh impact evaluations uh over the past decade suggests that this assumption is flawed um and there is a growing body of evidence showing that interventions designed using principles from with behavioral economics are more likely to improve people's uh money management behavior than other interventions so financial inclusion uh we we we at cap are working on programs uh on uh the improvement on financial inclusion and we see that this requires financially capable customers who actively use products for their benefits and um the ultimate goal of financial education programs is to help develop financially capable customers those with the with the attitudes the knowledge the skills and behaviors to make financial decisions to improve their lives and there is also evidence that shows that higher levels of financial capabilities are related to greater levels of financial well-being or financial health through financial attitudes skills and behavior such as a savings behavior previous own experience with the financial sector uh comparison among different financial institutions before acquiring a new financial product personal participation or involvement in the in the in the financial decisions of the household among others so we see that uh for example this project uh could benefit a lot um from uh incorporating financial education from this uh behavior perspective i mean uh taking into account uh the needs of the the customer needs and their behavior and incorporating uh these kind of notches that will will help uh the the customer or the remittance receiver uh to improve their uh savings behavior for example uh so we we see this as a as a very important opportunity uh to incorporate uh these uh financial uh education uh evidence into into into into this this product in in colombia yeah i totally agree with that i mean if actually you you need to make sure that when you approach financial education you can you you can help individuals and and adults to uh to improve their financial capabilities and and therefore their financial health by by changing behavior so i think that uh this is this is the the approach that evidence uh tell us and i'm happy to uh to hear that the latin american development bank is working on that as well and and can also contribute to to do this to this project so uh moving forward in terms of uh not only what is going on in colombia but but also uh what is going on in in the region i would like to to bail on on the answer on on that amit uh previously made in terms of of uh the offering of other products in in latin america so um the question that i have for you i mean is whether of inclusive right now is is planning to expand the offering of of financial services in latin america in addition to uh to this pilot that that is working with with angle app so if if you want to elaborate on that uh that would be great sure thank you very much um yes the short answer to that is yes and and in a couple different and distinct ways one is we want to make sure that first and foremost that we can provide uh the essential financial crimes compliance aml toolkit so that any organization that's building within the context of the stellar ecosystem has a you know truly a plug-and-play solution for their aml and kyc and kyb needs and that there's ecosystem efficiencies built in with some of the capabilities that we provide in particular with the digital digitally verifiable uh credentials that equally applied to individuals and small businesses like yvonne said in particular it's not just households and individuals that are trying to get access to uh to financial services but also small businesses that really is the engine of global job growth certainly the case in the us certainly the case in latam and if we can create more enablements for them in two or three distinct ways one especially in markets that have a number of different macro economic humanitarian or other uh considerations uh to review one is whether they be capital controls high inflation rates and the like individuals at the household level and organizations want to know that when they hold value that that value is secure and so to the extent that we can provide connectivity for organizations within the context of the lat time community like um uh unclop uh and others that can connect individuals to their therefore hold value in a u.s account that provides some stability with respect to that the the the insured accounts that we can provide through some of our bank partners the second is that there are a number of organizations including and built within the context of the stellar ecosystem that are also providing uh savings and or other higher yield um account structures so uh higher yield usdc for example where organizations and individuals can now hold value in much more stable ways that provide a little bit higher yield than say for example non-interest bearing or other accounts that that might happen the third is in the payment side and obviously that's a core value proposition with the stellar ecosystem driving down the cost of payments but really folks really want to be able to transfer value securely and in near real time and while some of the organizations may be legal entities corporate enterprises are less concerned about the multi-day settlement they just want to ensure that there is a a secure way to send value they certainly want to minimize the market and other volatility characteristics that some of the alternative coins offer and this is where stable coins like usdc play a very very large value having interoperability into local fiat systems is the fourth space and uh um congrats to the to the group and yvonne and and others like him that are trying to provide the ability to connect fiat um in local currency uh either as a payout or as a pay in to a stable coin ecosystem that now is interoperable and then fifthly i i should say is that what we are working to expand uh within within the context of the stellar community is obviously not only is there interconnectivity between latam and the us but there's greater greater interconnectivity uh between latam and africa africa and europe africa and the us and you now have organizations that are globally engaged uh we ourselves are a decentralized company we have individuals based all over the us but also in europe and elsewhere and these small businesses now have the ability in a digitizing economy even if you're five people 10 people to have individual contractors subcontractors vendors suppliers counterparts all over the world and that requires an ecosystem that is community bank like but in a global uh in a global and peer-to-peer functioning way that's exciting so as we have small businesses that enable an individual in rural africa or in europe or latam to transact just as an inter-company set of financial services or they're transacting with their beneficiaries vendors suppliers and other counterparties in their ecosystem like gamers like subcontractors like freelancers like small medium merchants and the like operating in these marketplaces those marketplaces want to secure value transfer ecosystem and they want to do so compliantly so those are the four or five ways that we are looking to expand these services beyond just compliance thank you very much for that that is impressive to to be honest and and i look forward to hearing more uh in a couple of months um ivan um do you want to share some details on on the pilot that that actually you are working with with inclusive and and also we are we are in a phase where uh where at some point we are going to work as well with the latin american development bank uh and uh basically if you want to also provide some uh some details on on the road map on in colombia in the short and medium term that would be great okay yeah uh yeah we we are working together with inclusive on build and building bringing a solution uh for remittances okay between us and colombia but people need to understand that what we are bringing at the end of the day is infrastructure so all other companies or developers can build solutions on top of this race but we what we are doing is just building brands compliance race and of course what we are doing today is working hand by hand with local regulators within within colombia because of uh its highly necessary to them for to get our best understanding of what we do and what how this this this blockchain race could help uh not only people but also the entire financial industry providing providing uh more financial products and services to the people so what we do is bring in uh bringing services bringing um bring bringing infrastructure okay so not only us today we we are working to to to bring a a remittances platform for colombians to get uh get money from their relatives in the us or send money to the us but once we we can prove that this rate this infrastructure is compliant is it's uh it's huge for for for the standard traditional uh remittances services uh much faster and cheaper for people we we will start working on letting they know that it is an infrastructure that any other company within colombia or within any other country because we are a huge network can bring products uh financial services on top of this infrastructure um and that is is what we are working today uh we are still not life in in colombia because of we need to have a huge understanding of of what we do with regulators and of course we we are we are working together with them and we are we are working to to to run the project within the the local uh regulation sandbox uh for for for them to have the the best understanding of what we do and of course as as as bigger and as a robust the project could be uh if we if we work together on this uh of course the the whole industry will be uh will get the benefits of this infrastructure um i assume i think that that probably in the in the next month uh we could launch the platform but again i'm a technical guy and and i i insist that i will i would love to see other companies within colombia or u.s to start thinking uh financial solutions to build on top of these blockchain rails we are working to to prove that is uh that it represents a huge benefit for people but uh please those companies or developers that are seeing this this panel please have in mind that you can you could you could bring your solutions on top of this uh network so that is that is what we are doing uh still working with regulators to make pretty sure that we are okay and we we we have the grant to to to have the because the the the local ecosystem with this with this technology and as soon as we we could move forward you know in a few months we will launch the remittances platform but and start working on on other other solutions or other fine financial services like local payments or uh worldwide payments uh whatever i i hope not being me who brings those solutions but other companies to build on top of the infrastructure we are bringing and that's that's the history and i'm really excited on what we what we are doing and and of course having a huge partners like the like like the caf and the stellar develop foundation uh it's it's huge and i'm really optimistic on that we will make uh really noise on the on the on the latin american uh economist and people economy thank you very much for that ivan i think that you mentioned something that is really important that is actually working together with regulators so actually these public private partnerships just to make sure that uh that you can not actually the technology not only the technology but actually the use cases are are developed in in in different kind of of economies so building on on that answer uh diana uh from a development uh perspective from a financial inclusion perspective how do you think that actually regulators and policy makers can design a landscape that is that would promote the use of of the the responsible use of technology for for bringing more more inclusion so so so do you have some some thoughts on on that um yes i think that um i mean working together with the regulator and um um trying to be i mean part of the uh regulatory sandboxes in in each country i think it's it is it is very important as as evangelist mentioned uh the work that uh he's been doing with the financial superintendency in colombia and the and the regulatory sandbox is is very important and i think that these partnerships are are are key uh in order uh i mean for for for for the uh the companies uh to align to to the regulation and and also for the regulators because they learn a lot uh on the these these innovative uh business models uh and they adore and they can adjust uh the regulations uh to that financial innovation so i think uh it is it is very important that is uh a win-win uh from from the both both sides um and i also uh think that uh also incorporating uh these these this aspect that we were talking about uh on financial education and consumer protection is key and for the regulator this is this is very important this is this is not only important uh to to the consumer but but also from the regulation uh point of view uh to incorporate uh these uh financial education and and the impact of the the usage of the product on the consumer protection and and also the financial health of the customer yeah i totally agree with that approach and what actually you you have said uh i have the i think that we are running out of time so i have the last question for for all of you maybe we can start with with amit and then we can continue with evan and and then with diana uh that actually we have been uh speaking a lot about cross-border payments and remittances and b2b payments uh what other use cases you envision that could be built not only on blockchain but actually in the financial innovation space that that would promote uh access and usage of financial services and and and actually contributing to those who are in informal economy to to start operating in the formal economy in latin america so i mean do you want to to go first sure there are a couple and obviously thematically we've touched on some of them already the the cross-border remittance use case is not only very important as it relates to household remittances and those small dollar payments that individuals are making um as some folks have have opined and there's a lot of data out of the world bank imf and elsewhere that showed that especially outbound remittances from the u.s to many latin countries and elsewhere in the in the world uh constitute very high percentage of even those countries gdp and the longevity for those households to actually get funds from from the united states so the income economy if you will is just massive i think it's worth worth re-emphasizing small business payments because like i said uh the the global engine of job growth is small businesses the number of small medium enterprises and micro enterprises is really responsible for 90 plus percent of global job growth and this comes back to the the changing nature of the job landscape where there are more contractors subcontractors freelancers doing work interconnected with companies all over the the globe that need a uh much more secure and and innovative financial services space small businesses are categorically seen as high risk by many traditional lenders so the not only the ability for those individuals that are themselves small businesses as a contractor or freelancer or what we call an independent worker but also those small businesses are competing for uh lending products uh and the extension of credit to just grow start and grow their businesses and so the the that's another product that that continues to be formulated within the context of fintechs as well as in blockchain enabled ecosystem so small dollar lending small business financing is massive uh to enable these companies to start and to grow and these can be enabled very easily in the same payments mechanisms that these blockchain networks uh provide like with stellar um and many of them need the appropriate due diligence uh to ensure that they've got the the background legitimacy and and effectively the worthiness to get that that um those products and services um and then the the third and fourth i would say is um while we often talk about the the inclusion aspects within the context of of private industry um the non-profit and humanitarian development sector cannot be overlooked here more and more of organizations are realizing that being able to donate in non-fiat assets is attractive we look at the conflict in ukraine within 48 72 hours the millions and millions of crypto assets that were donated on behalf of many ngos and individuals around the planet to support the cause in ukraine and this is not a one-off there are many organizations many uh countries frontier markets uh those in conflict facing crises that quite frankly it's much easier for them to get a wallet and have uh tokens deposited and transferred to their wallet than it would be for them to get any kind of fiat asset uh because of the absence of banking systems especially when you think about refugees and others which you're talking about tens of millions of individuals worldwide that that don't have access to them and then you add the billion or so people on the planet that are just not born with an id well no bank traditional financial services company sees them as a legitimate party in the ecosystem and this is where not only the blockchain from a compliance perspective digital identity perspective pays huge value but then the ability to then tokenize value and create an ecosystem where you can send value to them directly in a way that's secure and then the final piece i will just say because it's a little outside of the financial inclusion mandate but equally relevant the financial services ecosystem and payments ecosystem is in radical need of innovation anyway and that pays tremendous dividends to corporate enterprises imagine the hundreds of billions of dollars that are transacted between corporates uh you know on a uh daily monthly and yearly basis to be able to tokenize that financing be able to do it near real time and securely takes a lot of noise and rent seeking behavior that is in the traditional financial space with the number of financial intermediaries that blockchain ecosystems like stellar can really provide and so i think that that provides a much more inclusive secure economy and and i think that's where the future will be that's a great answer ivan i know that we are we have only a couple of minutes so if you want to yeah i i think i think uh more use cases could be local payments because of there are a lot of people that probably do not transact worldwide but they they they need and they deserve to have a way to use their money locally uh so it doesn't matter if they they they want to transact worldwide but using your money locally so it's also a great use case uh to use digital money and also what am i saying b2b uh b2b payments uh and b2c payments i imagine uh in a few years uh having go into a market and paying with uh with my phone with with a cure and the the the merchant will will have the money in their wallet instantly at no cost and i'm paying the the same way and i imagine uh i imagine that local payments b2b payments um and b2 b2c payments yeah totally agree with that um diana what do you think yeah very very quick uh i i think more on the on the financial innovation perspective uh i see more consumer-centric approaches or more consumer-centric products that that takes into into account i mean in the in the design are the needs of the of the different segments of population for example women uh products that are that have this gender perspective uh for example um and also uh that uh that includes uh one thing that i think it is it is important and and and and i didn't touch in my in in the in the first question uh which is uh the the the promotion of uh digital literacy uh because i mean uh as as a part of of the financial education programs is it is it is important to to pay special attention uh to foster the digital skills and knowledge of the of the population and and and the most vulnerable populations uh who are the ones that that traditionally uh have been excluded from the financial system and also lacks uh these uh digital capabilities and it is important uh to uh to to to close this gap and and not open another another gap as as we have on uh financial capabilities yeah yeah totally agree with that as well so um thank you very much for for joining uh this panel we have heard actually what are the benefits and and opportunities of of of using uh the blockchain technology and stablecoins and we have we have heard that security reduction of costs uh mitigating aml and cft trace abilities and our and our benefit that i that i i got here but also uh helping or contributing uh to small businesses to transition from the informal economy to the formal economy uh but also in terms of not challenges but but we also need to consider uh financial literacy and financial education in terms of of making sure that those uh receiving funds in a cross-border payments scenario have all the all the knowledge and all the capability in order to to use the financial services you know in in in a good way um so evidence uh tell us that actually you can you can play around with different variables or elements in order to make sure that the impact of that uh financial education schemes are are greater uh so so with that uh we are uh finalizing the the panel i would like to thank you for for uh participating today and and i'm looking forward to continue this conversation in in the nearly future so so thank you very much again for uh for the time
