The core CAP team deliberated on proposed CAPs:

1. Add a constructor to the Rust Soroban variant. [CAP](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0058.md)
   1. The team was concerned about a potential compatibility break, which Dima addressed. There were no further concerns.
2. Add the BLS12-381 curve and required field arithmetic. [CAP](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0059.md)
   1. The team was concerned about providing functions to verify invalid inputs. It is too computationally expensive to validate in the contract layer, so this may need to be implemented as a host function. Jay is looking for ecosystem feedback on use cases that require strict input validation.
   2. There were no further concerns.
3. Improve Soroban VM performance. [CAP discussion](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0060.md)
   1. The team commented on the accuracy of the measurement method, but the demonstrated wall-clock time benefits were considered promising.
   2. It was suggested to expose the performance improvements to contract developers, creating an incentive to optimize contracts and take advantage of the improvements.
   3. There were no further concerns.
