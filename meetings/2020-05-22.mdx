Nikhil Saraf introduces **Kelp GUI v1**, the desktop interface for Kelp—an open-source trading bot originally built for the Stellar decentralized exchange (and later extended to many centralized exchanges via the CLI). The focus of the talk is how the GUI lowers the barrier for non-technical liquidity providers by turning configuration-heavy market-making into a guided workflow: generate a starter bot, or create a custom one by selecting assets, setting spreads and levels, and wiring up price feeds.

He explains how pricing in the **buy/sell strategy** works by composing a numerator and denominator feed (for example, valuing XLM via an exchange feed while treating a “coupon” asset as a fixed $1). The GUI displays the derived mid price and lets users define multiple “levels” around that mid, which translate into ladders of bids and asks. A live demo shows creating two bots on testnet, connecting a fiat price feed (Currencylayer), and using “advanced” price adjustments (offsets) to intentionally misprice one bot so it trades through the other—illustrating how bots place, cross, and refresh offers over time.

Nicholas also emphasizes **operational hygiene**: if you quit without stopping a bot, its offers can remain on the orderbook, potentially filling unexpectedly. Stopping a bot should both halt the process and cancel outstanding offers so the market doesn’t retain stray bids/asks after you’re done.

### Key Topics

- What Kelp is (CLI + strategies in Go) and why the GUI matters for first-time market makers on the SDEX.
- Bot setup workflow: secret key handling, asset/issuer selection, and the “starter bot” vs custom configuration paths.
- Price feeds and derived pricing: composing numerator/denominator sources, sanity-checking quotes, and understanding how the bot refreshes prices on an interval.
- Market-making controls: spreads, multi-level ladders, order sizing, and how thin/no markets affect displayed spread.
- Advanced safeguards and tuning: correction knobs (offset % / offset), multipliers, and preventing bad quoting when price data drifts.
- Safe shutdown: stopping bots to cancel offers so you don’t leave live orders behind.

[00:00] Today we're going to be talking about the Kelp GUI, where anyone can create crypto. My name is Nicholas Har and I'm one of the developers for the Stellar Development Foundation. We're going to go over what is kelp. What is a Kelp GUI version one? We're going to see some screenshots and then we're going to go into a demo and then have some time for questions later on. So what is kelp? Kalp is a trading bot that has a command line interface. It was built for the Stellar decentralized exchange and later on we added support for over 100 centralized exchanges. You can customize existing trading strategies with configuration files. Today we have four trading strategies. You can create new trading strategies by

[01:00] Writing your own code. Gelp is written in Golang, So any trading strategies that you write would need to be written in Golang today, with the possibility of supporting more languages in the future. We open sourced Kelp in the summer of 2018. The Kelp GUI is a relatively newer addition to Kelp. It is a GUI to manage multiple cut bot instances. Today it does not work on centralized exchanges and only works on the Stellar decentralized exchange. We start off with just one trading strategy to make it easier for people to learn how the UI works. You can't create new trading strategies today, but in the future, any trading strategies that are created on kelp will automatically be supported by the UI. In addition to writing the back end for the UI in Golang, we added support for React for the front end.

[02:00] The UI was open sourced in the summer of 2019, and only last month did we release the first release candidate of the UI. We have an integration for the CCXT REST server which gives you native access to data from all of those 100 exchanges directly into the UI, without any additional installations. You can download it as a desktop application and very soon you will be able to run it in a hosted test net environment as well. So this is what kelp look like when you first load the application. You have two options. The first one is to autogenerate your first test bot. This is for people who are first time users of kelp and gives them a starter bot that they can use. We have a video that we uploaded with the blog post.

[03:00] Announcement of the kelp y. That walks you through creating your first test bot through auto generation. The second option is to create your own bot, which gives you a little more controls over the parameters of your bot. On the top left, you can see the version being used for this UI and you also have an option to quit the application when you're done using it. This is a screen to create a new bot or to edit an existing bot. You enter your secret key over here and you can see the corresponding public key. You enter the assets that you want to trade. For XLM you don't have any issuer, But for all other assets you have an asset issuer Coupon. Out. Here is just a token asset that we use. This could represent anything. It is just a test market.

[04:00] This is the price feed section for the buy sell strategy, which is the first strategy that you are allowed to use on the UI. The price feed allows you to set the prices for the base asset and the quote asset described on the previous page. The base asset is always set as a numerator. In this case, because our base asset was XLM, we've chosen to price it as the XLM USDT price from Binance under the centralized exchange section, And you can see a sample price out here in the screenshot. For the denominator, we're going to price the coupon asset as one unit of US dollar. So we use the fixed value of 1 0 Again, coupon here is can represent any asset. For the purposes of this video and this demo, we're going to be treating it as a US dollar.

[05:00] This box out here tells you what the final calculation is of your price. You can see how the price is derived. We basically take the price of the XLM coupon market, We take the price of the numerator divided by the denominator and then we get the final price. The sentence makes it easier to understand how you are pricing the asset, which we will go into more detail in the demo At the end here. We have some levels that tell you how you can price the different levels that spread out from the center mid price that has been set over here of 06192. Once you've created a few bots, this is how your kelp application or your kelp forest is going to look like. We have the first autogenerated bot of George

[06:00] The auspicious octopus. We've created two more bots: Harry the harmless habuka, and Jerry the unsightly shrimp. If you take a look on the left side, you can see the markets and the balances of these bots for those tokens. So George has about 9 799 99 lumens and 1 0 coupon tokens. Similarly, Harry has is trading in the Bitcoin and USD market and Harry has no balance in either of those markets. And Jerry is trading in the Lumen BTC market and has close to 10 000 lumens. The spread for both of Harry and Jerry are negative one because no market exists, whereas George is currently running and has created a market with a spread close to 0 20 This spread out here does not necessarily indicate the spread that

[07:00] George is creating, but it is the spread of the market. You can also see how often the bot is updated. This is a check on the last time that we got information about the spread and the bids and the asks for this given bot. This typically runs about 5 seconds by default. For the UI, If you click on the three button menu over here, you have the option to select to see the offers and the market for this given bot and also the. To edit the bot: if it is in the stop mode, You could also delete the bot if you wanted. Let's go ahead and see a demo of how the bot works. So I've started up the bot in my machine and we see the first screen out here.

[08:00] So I'm going to go ahead and create the. first bot manually. So we have Madison, the glamorous sawfish. Let's create a new secret key. So the bot will automatically create a new secret key for us and create the relevant trust lines, So we don't have to worry about that. Let's trade in the USD and euro market. Now we are trading on the test network out here and, for simplicity, let's use the default asset issuer that we have. So I'm going to paste that in both of these token issuer spaces. Now, one advantage of using the default asset issuer is that the bot is going to create

[09:00] And fund the account with 1 000 units of each of these tokens. Now, if we go to the advanced settings, we can see how often this bot runs, So by default it runs once every 60 seconds. For the purposes of this demo, let's change this to 6 seconds. We also have a randomized delay by default which is set to 15 seconds. Let's set that to zero for now. There are some more advanced settings out here which I won't go into detail for this video. When we want to price this market, let's try and set the best price for the USD token. Now, because this is a dollar and we're generally using the dollar denominator values, we can actually just use a fixed price of one.

[10:00] However, for the denominator, we're pricing the euro token. For that we actually want to use the price of the euro. So let's go to fiat, which uses the currency layer API. Let's select euro. Now you notice that it says that the price is missing. It also has an error message out here that says that we have an invalid API key. Of course, because we don't have an API key out here. So I've signed up for a free account for currency layer. So I'm going to go ahead and use that key. I'm going to refresh this price And, as you can see, the price is updated. It's always good to do a sanity check on the prices that you get over here, because these are the prices that the bot is going to see when it's running on a continuous basis. 1 088

[11:00] As a price for the euro makes sense because a euro is worth more than a dollar. Now, one thing to note about these price feeds is that the this price that you see out here is not the price that is hardcoded into the bot. The bot is going to run the same query at every time interval that it runs, which we previously set to 6 seconds. So it's going to get a price that moves with the market, as you have set for this price feed. So this is a very active and dynamic price feed. As you can see, we run the calculation of taking the net price that we will get, which is1 US divided by 1 0888 for the euro price, which gives us 0 91844 The sentence helps explain that, which is: you are valuing one unit of the US dollar at 0 91844 units of a euro. This makes sense

[12:00] Because a euro is worth more than a US, dollar. Now we come to the levels. By default, the bot starts out with four levels- Why don't we change these amounts to be 50 just for the purposes of this demo? And it's being set at a spread value of 0 1 from the mid price, Which means that the bid ask spread is 0 2 here, 0 3 here, 0 4 and 0 5 So this bot is now in the process of initializing, which means that the application is creating the necessary trust lines and issuing the relevant assets to the new secret key account

[13:00] That we created. This usually takes a little bit of time, and it seems like we're done So. As you can see, we have a th00and units of the of USD as well as the euro. And if we hover over to this I icon, we can see the asset issuer And the spread, of course, is negative one, because we don't have a market yet. Now let's create a second bot that is going to compete with the first bot before we start any of them. So we're going to follow the same process, but I'm just going to do this a little quicker. We're going to set this to be around the same time interval just for the purpose of this demo.

[14:00] Writing our sanity checks. We get about the same price. So that's right. We can just leave this at 100. That's fine. Now we want these bots to compete with each other. Now, normally we would not force these bots to compete, but I'm trying to show a specific example out here which allows this, the second bot, to purchase all of the US dollars from the first bot. So I'm intentionally mispricing the second bot.

[15:00] I do that by adding a 0 05 cent offset to this bot's price. Now, usually this advanced setting section is there to correct any prices that I might see. So, for example, if I was to go to the Google website and find a price for a token, and that's the one I chose to use. Or if there was a price that my bank was giving me, and I wanted the currency layer price feed to come closer to that. We have a way of adjusting the price feed once we receive the price feed, by setting the offset percentage, which can be a negative value, and the offset as well, which can be a positive or negative value, and this allows us to make any corrections in the price that we get. So in this video I'm misusing this advanced setting intentionally just for the purposes of this demo. Let's go ahead and create this bot.

[16:00] So Madison was the first bot that we created and Joshua was the second one. If I click on show market, it's going to open up the screen on the second window. Let's see that. Now you can see we have the USD euro market for the same token issuer, but there's no market. Let's start the bot for the first part, which is Madison. This is the one that is priced correctly. What we're going to see is that there are some bids and asks placed against this bot, So you can see that the bot is pricing this asset at close to 918.

[17:00] Now let's start the second bot. What we're going to see is that this th00and USD balance is going to get trained out and the euro balance is going to increase for Madison, whereas Joshua is going to see an increase in the USD balance and a decrease in the euro balance. So what is actually happening is that Joshua is being priced- if you look at the mouse cursor on the right side over here- and the asks of Joshua are hitting against- the asks of Madison, which are then crossing over, and then we get some trades. So this is being run once every 6 seconds. So pretty soon we will see the entire amount getting trained. You can also see out here that we have

[18:00] Two additional bids at 96, which is higher than Madison's bids. The reason is because Joshua now has enough dollars to be placing these bids, but Madison is not able to consume them, So Joshua's bids would then lie on the orderbook. So it looks like we're about done here. Madison has 0 2 left and Joshua has pretty much the entire amount of the 2 000 USD initially allocated for these bonds. You can also see that the bids and the asks have changed depending on how these orders were placed and consumed.

[19:00] Now getting back to the curl window. So we are now ready to stop these bugs and quit the application. But before we quit the application, we should be very careful to hit the stop button, Because if we don't do that, then these bots will- although they will be stopped running these orders of one bid, four asks and four bids and zero ask would still remain on the orderbook, which would then potentially see some trades happening without us having expected it. So it's always important to stop these bots. Let's go ahead and do that. In the process of stopping these bots, the application kills the bots as well as deletes the offers associated with the bot. As you can see, these bids and asks have gone to zero And the spread has gone back to negative one, as you can see in the window.

[20:00] So, in summary, we went through what is scalp, what is the kelp GUI version one, some improvements that we would have in the UI, the screenshots and a demo of how you can create two bots in the UI to trade against each other. Let's go into some questions.

[21:00] Thank you everyone for attending this session and I hope that you all learned something about the cali today. Thank you,
