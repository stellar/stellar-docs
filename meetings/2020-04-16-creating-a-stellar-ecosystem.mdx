Lisa Nestor moderated the first virtual roundtable focused on codifying a “send/receive” SEP so anchors can pay each other on behalf of end users. She explained how SEPs move from community discussions to GitHub pull requests, why this proposal builds on SEP-6/24/10, and the expectation that anchors pre-negotiate rails before exposing the feature inside their wallets.

Tempo, SatoshiPay, and Cowrie then pressure-tested the draft with real remittance scenarios: where KYC should live, whether SEP-12 still helps, how to request refunds or renames when a cash pickup fails, and which API statuses wallets need to handle pending compliance checks. The group aligned on keeping the interface small while leaving room for compliance-as-a-service providers and future merchant flows.

Key discussion threads:

- Definition of a send/receive SEP: why anchors need a standard endpoint, how it reuses SEP-6/24 semantics, and which pieces (user onboarding, bilateral agreements) live outside the protocol.
- Handling KYC data: when the sending anchor can store and reuse customer info, if SEP-12 still adds value, and how third-party compliance providers might plug in.
- Edge cases to support—refunds, pending statuses, cash rename requests, and high-value transactions that require proof of funds from downstream partners.
