Marta Lokhova translated SCP into an intuitive walkthrough. She zoomed out from whitepapers to explain quorum sets, thresholds, blocking sets, and statements, then used simple diagrams to show how federated voting moves a node from “I’m not sure” to “I confirm” on a transaction set.

With that foundation she treated SCP as a funnel: nomination keeps proposing candidate transaction sets while the ballot protocol prepares and commits one value, even if nomination continues in the background. The talk closed with guidance on thresholds (67% across orgs, lower within your own nodes) and where to dig deeper.

Key discussion threads:

- Plain-language definitions of quorum sets, blocking sets, and why statements are the building blocks of consensus.
- Federated voting rules (vote, accept, confirm) and a step-by-step demo of how blocking sets force lagging nodes to catch up.
- How nomination and ballot phases interact, why nodes start ballot work optimistically, and practical advice on configuring quorum thresholds safely.

all right hi everyone my name is Marta and I'm a software engineer on the stellar core team and today I'm here to talk to you about the stellar consensus protocol we're briefly going to go over the agenda so first we're gonna have some motivation for this talk why are we even doing this and what are the things that we're going to cover we're then going to have a quick recap on chorim's and what they are and
