- hi everybody um actually can you allow me to present my or to to uh share my screen here or the host i can help you share from my end if that's okay i think i can okay i can share as well um great welcome everybody as as gift said we're going to introduce you um to dfs lab but more importantly the boot camp and what to expect from the event coming up and um inca from stuller is also going to say a few things about how bootcamp fits into their the community fund and also you know a little bit about what to expect from their side so here's our agenda we'll give you kind of a quick overview of sdf and it's something fun little bianca and then i'll give you a bit more about um the boot camp so just to just to kind of quickly give you an introduction to who we are at dfs lab we um we're an early stage investor in the african tech scene we invest very early uh often at precede in startups that are digitizing the african economy so we invest in um a lot of uh marketplaces e-commerce b2b e-commerce social commerce uh and everything along kind of the the uh the value chain of commerce in in africa and we we have kind of a uh we're a very research driven thesis based investor and our belief is that you know while a lot of attention is being paid to fintech and some of the other areas that investors are excited about we think the real prize is actually using some of those tools to digitize the economy root and branch and go from kind of cache based and offline to digital based and online so you can you can tell because of that belief you can probably understand why you know we're very aligned with stellar because i think they have kind of a similar uh belief around you know digitizing the economy and making finance uh seamless and online and all that so um and we're as an investor we're very um hands-on we don't call ourselves an accelerator program because we don't do batches with kind of a fixed curriculum we actually focus on the individual needs of each company but we're very very hands-on we spend um we have you know a few folks dedicated full-time basically to supporting our portfolio companies and and um we're basically there to help them usually go from the early precede phase to um to their first seed round that's where we generally tend to intervene and um we um can't say too much about it yet but there's more coming in the partnership area between us and stellar uh around you know how we can help support more companies with more funding and things like that so i i can't say too much about it yet but should be some exciting stuff coming up in the future so um that's us we have uh we have team in in nairobi uh that's that's gift and also joseph who who's um there as well but we also have people in kenya and south africa i'm in paris steven other partners in san francisco and we bring a whole host of different skills um i won't go into everything but i think that gives you a little bit of a an intro to who we are as an organization um i could do you want to take over for a sec and give us a little bit more background on stellar and the community fund sure thing yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah so uh for everyone who doesn't know me and it's neon desk my name is ankur and i'm a program manager at the steli development foundation or sdf or short bar we're going to say a lot of abbreviations today sdf scf so just preparing you for that and so sdf is a non-profit uh organization with a mission to create equitable access to the global financial system and as a non-profit we shepherd the development and growth of stellar which is a decentralized open source layer one blockchain network that connects the world's financial infrastructure so stellar is really a back end so to speak to power apps and services where anyone can issue store transfer and trade all sorts of assets um seller also has built-in like account logic for creating accounts and assets signing transactions and tracking balances overall um like stellar is really purposely designed to streamline financial services and really unlock the world's economic potential by making money more fluid markets more open and people more empowered um so there is like an exterior is an open source which means that anyone can build whatever they desire on the network with no application or permission needed and speaking of building on stellar i lead a program called the stellar community fund or scf for short the second abbreviation which is an open application a grant program hosted by us that serves us the springboard for many businesses and developers building on stellar to turn their concepts into tangible products and services based on input from the stellar community um we've actually it's quite an old fund like we're together with our predecessor it's been around since about like 2016 and has distributed almost 200 million xlm which is stellar's native currency uh to hundreds of seller-based projects based on community input so that's pretty exciting um you know what's different i know that there are many grants out there for for blockchain so what makes us different three reasons um so on at scf all kinds of use cases and project scope sizes are welcome and where other grants may primarily focus on innovation on traditional like services scf also funds like d5 nfts community education and developer tool projects also the community is actively involved in guiding and supporting the projects as well as voting for the projects they want to see earn a grant um also fun fact scf grants have no strings attached so this means that grant recipients decide how to spend their grant and don't need to pay anything back so pretty pretty sweet i would say um so saf really operates biannually in form of rounds and right now the scf is welcoming submissions for its 11th iteration it's been 11 rounds already with a total excellent pool of 8 million so any developer team or company building on seller can submit to the scf and request funding up to about like 200 a thousand dollars worth of xlm which depends on their project's code aside from funding participating in scf allows you to gather useful feedback from the community gain traction in the ecosystem and also opens up unique opportunities for growth so yeah and for the first time ever let's uh let's skip let's go to the next slide jake yeah for the first time ever uh submissions that uh get selected to participate in the scf and are eligible to participate in boot camp can announce now participating sorry can now participate in a virtual startup bootcamp from november 1 to four that will really like kick start their journey on stellar or even if you're already in stellar ecosystem like help with a particular problem that you haven't been able to solve before with the help of experts and facilitators from both sdf dfs lab and the community um so yeah over the course of a few days participants will work with these facilitators to find a problem storyboard a solution and develop a rapid prototype before getting feedback from the stellar community fund um from the Stellar community uh but jake will tell you much much more about that um just so you know before if you want to get considered for participation submit your style based project to the staff before september 25th and this is a little uh over a week so it's really coming up uh so that is the deadline before september september 25th um also i saw some questions in the in the um in the q and a section here on the zoom so definitely add your questions there and we'll have a little um a q a session like right after um everything like at the end of the session right um that's all from me and uh yeah jake take it away thank you okay um yeah that uh that was great so so yeah i'm gonna give you kind of um an overview of what to expect if you if you come to this event and um we're really excited about it we we always we've done a couple of these with um stellar already in the past and they're super fun for us because we get to see new companies who are you know often new to stellar they're trying to create you know some kind of an innovation or crack some difficult challenge in the financial services space and uh it's a very kind of a intense interaction where we really get to go deep in what they're trying to build what their challenges are you know etc we get to meet their team and all that kind of thing and so we really like them and i think i think the seller team does too for the same reasons you know if you just really get to dive in and for us it's also great that we get to be hands-on with each company so we're not we're not just kind of like lecturing about you know the future of fintech and all that kind of stuff when you go to a normal conference the the boot camp is really uh you and your team coming and doing work in a really intensive but structured way with help from a whole bunch of different people us experts stellar etc so it's not it's definitely not something you want to think about like a typical conference or something like that it's really you working on your product which is um you know which is what you should be doing if you're running a um so i'm going to start with kind of just high level you know almost like the philosophy of a design sprint right so some of you uh probably done design sprints you know we didn't we didn't invent them and uh we won't be the last to use them um but we have kind of our own version of the design sprint that we do and um the real idea is that you test and prototype a solution in just five days and um you start with um you know a problem um you you you define you know the challenge that you're trying to overcome and then we have kind of a step-by-step process once you've uh defined that problem to go from there to a realistic prototype that you can put in front of users and get their reaction and that's the critical thing about a sprint the design sprints is you're trying to avoid building an actual product which sounds weird right like why why are we teaching you or why are we encouraging you to avoid building product everyone else is telling you yeah build product that's the most important thing but um what's important is actually to build product that people want and this approach of a design sprint is a way to fast forward into the future and say okay how are people reacting to this product before we've actually built it so we don't have to waste the time building it if they don't react in the way we hope and it's a it's a great methodology there's a few links here you can read more about it i encourage you to do that but that's the fundamental philosophy of what we're trying to accomplish with this and and you'll be surprised how realistic a prototype you can build so um here's here's the process now some of you have done um you know sprints based on the sprint book which we had to link to on the last slide uh or some of the other methodologies this will look a little bit different but it's okay you know a lot of the same steps are there and the same fundamental outcome is is there so because because we kind of have limited time and we're planning to we're assuming that there's going to be a large number of participants we're going to try and have each participant team define the problem they're trying to solve before you show up so that'll be important to know is that you know spend a little bit of time before we start on day one actually figuring out and defining a problem we're going to send you some exercises to do to make sure that you've actually done that because it's actually kind of a common problem we see with product designers and founders where they'll say oh i know what the problem is but they actually haven't thought it through in enough detail to to really have a high resolution version of the problem so that's what we're going to ask you to do before before the event starts um day one will then be to say okay um let's take the problem that we have map out what the sort of you know original customer journey is and um and think through where in that customer journey we might want what do you sort of current or or standard you know industry standard customer journey and then where in that customer journey or that that sort of experience do we want to intervene with the prototype that we're creating today right um so that's day one it's really mapping out the problem in high level detail and and figuring out where we want to intervene uh day two and i'm going to show you some examples of each of these in in in the next few slides so basically you'll come up with a map and i'll show you the map in a second right um day two you're gonna focus on which solutions uh you you you know you wanna use in your intervention and you're gonna generate actually a whole bunch of solution ideas um you know so you kind of widen the funnel of ideas before you then narrow down on which which which particular one you think is the best and that process of widening and creating new ideas we have a whole bunch of um well not a whole bunch but we have a few steps uh and exercises to do to make sure that you really stimulate your creativity and bring in you know the best ideas from the team and make sure that you don't jump on the first idea that comes you know comes to mind but you actually explore really deeply this set of ideas space in your head that you know sort of the set of the possible if you will and then we have a similar set of exercises where okay now all the team has kind of put all the ideas out there now we're going to narrow down using some anonymous voting and some ways of giving feedback that try to avoid biasing the solution based on who's the most convincing or who the feedback comes from often you know people uh think that you know because the ceo uh said oh i like this one then that's what we should do and at the end of the day the ceo probably has to make the decision uh but we do think that it's better to make sure that that everyone's kind of perspective and thought process is kind of treated equally in the initial part so that you you know you kind of narrow down the designs based on best thinking and not on who's you know the most senior or the most convincing you know some people just have a great way of putting it but that may not be the best idea so uh so so day two is really going to be about um focusing down on okay what's what's the uh sort of product approach and solution that we want to create uh the next step after that and that's kind of end of day two going into day three is uh first you're gonna storyboard your your prototype they're pretty high level of detail now people always want to resist this they you know they found their idea on day two um they want to jump right in and build it but we really really uh push back on that it's not a good idea and um the reason it's not is because basically when you jump in and try to build something you think you know what you're building because you've got this idea in your head but that idea doesn't have enough detail uh to actually be a coherent uh feature on your product and so what happens is you start building you build you know part a and part c and part f and then you realize you gotta fill in the other stuff and as you start to fill in the other stuff that you weren't thinking about you know when you just kick the thing off you realize that i've got to redo part a because it doesn't fit together better you know it didn't fit together well or doesn't make sense now that i've thought through part b and you start creating kind of a non-linear problem to solve where now everything is interrelated and you have to change this when they have to change this and slows you way down um and you end up having to often sometimes just completely restart and do the whole thing from the beginning right most of you probably experience that at some point when you're dealing with a complex system like a product right so what we say what we say we encourage people to do is spend the time it only takes a maybe two hours to really create a detailed storyboard that says okay at each step here's what we're going to do right there's going to be a button that button is going to take you here you know it's going to you're going to do something you're going to put in some data you're going to whatever you're going to do right all that stuff will be thought out including pretty high level detail on content if there is any so if there's wording if there's text if there's images you can say okay we need an image here we need to you know we need some wording here then you go into the um then you go into the prototyping phase you've got a really detailed map you know that says hey you're going to do it's just like a recipe that you follow and you are going to be so much faster in building your prototype if you've got that recipe laid out or that storyboard so and then in the prototyping phase that'll be day three and it'll actually kind of uh you know go beyond day three a little bit uh you'll have a bit of extra time on day four as well um where you'll be prototyping you will um have uh support from us uh but in particular you have support from the stellar team there'll be some uh engineer folks who you know know the apis and and all the all the ins and outs of the of all the different seller technology so that you know you won't get hung up trying to read through documentation and things like that i mean their documentation is actually quite good of course but um but in any case they'll be folks who can help you you know live in person as well uh and um there's gonna be the whole community and i'm gonna get into that uh in a second this is just kind of the sprint aspect there's gonna be a kind of a whole extra layer around all this uh which is the community part of it so once you're done with your prototype you're gonna get in uh you're gonna then test it with um with users and that's um actually something new we're doing this time if any of you were at the previous boot camp we didn't do that but it's it's supposed to be a integral part of the sprint it's very it's actually the most important part in fact it's it's really why you do a sprint a design sprint in the first place um which is to you know find out what people think and uh again we're gonna have to we're gonna have kind of an integrated integrated uh process where um people from the community can be your user uh and give you feedback on how you know how the experience goes when they use your product or test the feature or what have you um and so you're we're gonna do some workshops on how to how to do that testing in a way that doesn't bias your user it's very easy to bias someone who's uh who's testing a product or a feature and they're kind of looking at you see like you know how do you feel when they do x or y they don't want to hurt your feelings if it's clear that you're the one who built this thing you know they don't want to say it's terrible or that they don't like it or they give you a bunch of really positive feedback but it's not you know it's not real it's not their gut it's not their real gut reaction so um and there's a lot of other ways you can buy us uh you know by the way you present it by the way you talk about it by the way you know the situation you put the person in so we've got uh we're gonna we have a workshop plan where we're gonna give you some tools so that you uh know how to do a user uh test session with a prototype and how to collect the feedback and how to organize that feedback into sort of a useful output so um so that's that's the basic uh sort of step-by-step process of the sprint itself and um you know it like i said it's it's um it's a lot of fun it's very kind of both draining and energizing because it's pretty intense there's a lot of steps and and you you use in your brain a lot and you kind of kind of dump out all your creativity and make decisions and then build stuff it's pretty cool um and what we see is that often within the within the within each company not only does it help you know really rapidly go from uh you know some particular problem you're having with your user base or your you know user experience or whatever it is or you're trying to you know improve um or if you're or if you're fundamentally new maybe maybe you're just trying to build a very very very basic first version of the product if you don't have one yet um it really you know it definitely helps do that really quickly and in a way that like i said is based on user feedback and so much more validated and much more likely to result in the final product that you built you know being useful and liked by your users but it's often also a way because you spend because you're so focused and intensively working on your product um and you're doing it in the context of seeing a lot of other teams do their products think through their challenges and solutions etc you're interacting with a lot of people who you don't interact with on a daily basis but who are you know experts in this area um you know our mentors and facilitators us the stellar team the community members you're gonna have some really i think most of the time we see teams having these really interesting kind of revelations about their strategy their product you know their pathway to market their distribution all those other things that don't necessarily fit directly into the storyboard that you know or the product that you're prototyping but that fit in around it so it's a it's a it's a really valuable uh process i think and we see a lot of companies um getting a lot of value out of it i wanted to just kind of quickly give some um some examples just to illustrate what i was talking about so remember i talked about first day you draw out the pathway the user pathway and uh and then you figure you figure out where you want to uh focus and intervene so this was a this was one from a customer who was doing a cash in cash out at a mobile money agent network in kenya and um you can see kind of all the different process steps that are going on you know they're entering their number they're talking to the agent and i won't go through everything and then the team wanted to forward on uh sorry wanted to focus on these two areas that are circled in green so that was sort of the end of their first day basically of sprint they came out you know this is this is what they come up with there's there's other steps and other things they created um but um you know this was kind of the main final output and it basically guides the creation of their solutions the following days to say okay we know we know the process that where we fit in and we know what we want to change that's essentially what you come out of day one with um and what we're going to do we're still we're still kind of fine tuning how we're going to have the interactions with the community members and things like that but we are going to we are going to find a way that you can sort of present and show this to the community probably via discord and either get feedback people may vote on which which kind of problem uh you know you know problem diagram and problem choice that they like the best um et cetera et cetera so we're going to have some kind of like really cool ways where you can interact with the stellar community and really get you know even more feedback and more ideas and more more more sort of expert help with what you're doing so this is the output of day two or it's one example anyway and what you can see here is we got this three three pages i think each one is supposed to be a uh looks like an app screen on a phone maybe and um you know you're you're you're just kind of going through a sign looks like a sign up process right there's a sign up button on the first page and then uh there's a you know looks like there's some marketing lingo on the second page so it's kind of an onboarding process right uh the next one is maybe a text message based uh interface so anyway you know i i don't know exactly what this storyboard was supposed to be but it was supposed to be an onboarding process for a savings app and um you can also see how there's these blue and pink dots you're probably like why why are those all over the place so that's part of one of the steps in the process is people on the team and also other people outside of the team can vote on which things they like best and which things they like um you know that they think should go into the final version of the prototype and um that's non-bonding you know it's kind of like a thumbs up on facebook or claps on on medium you know it's just kind of like people express their opinion and that gives you kind of this heat map of like oh boy there's a bunch of dots over here on the you know in some part we should probably keep that and there's no dots in this upright no people didn't seem to care about that part so maybe we can cut it out or something like that um and eventually you'll have a couple of these because each you know there'll be more than one of these storyboards initially as remember i said we're going to first start with a bunch of ideas and then narrow it down eventually the the decider on the team will um will they make a choice and they may choose one storyboard or one sort of uh three three page you know thing or they might reconfigure and mix and match you can do whatever you want but the idea is to use this heat map and the feedback that you've got from the team to kind of choose okay we're going to do this particular idea for an onboarding or for a transaction process or whatever you're doing um yeah so that's the first thing that again community is going to get involved here too same same as before we're still kind of fine-tuning how exactly that's going to work but they're you're going to be able to kind of show and get feedback on some of this stuff and we're going to have i think some prizes and voting on like you know best best ideas and things like that so so um day three i believe will produce this storyboard so this is an example of storyboard i was talking about it's not super pretty um you can see but it gets the job done so essentially these are supposed to be a series of app screens you know you can see the wireframes and um in a few cases they uh just photographed hand-drawn diagrams and put them straight in there that's totally acceptable and cool um then they also put you know you can see kind of the step-by-step um uh with the yellow sticky notes where each one kind of says you know what's happening at each step and uh you get a little bit of the kind of the menu options and things like that and you know basically it's kind of like a transaction flow on some level and so this is you know um doesn't have to be that you know that you don't have tons and tons of detail as long as you know what's happening on each page and all the pages that you have to build and how they kind of interconnect to each other you know that's that's what you need to get done and once you have that then it's really easy then you just you know then you're just heads down you're building um the other thing we usually do is um wire diagram for the transaction process that's happening on the back end and that's you know where uh you're gonna be interfacing with um the different parts of the stellar system and you're in in your own you know your own system as well uh if you have one and so um this usually helps kind of clarify both the information and money flow if you know if it's a financial transaction of some kind uh that's happening on the back end not everyone needs to do one of these but most people do it's usually a valuable exercise doesn't take very long but again same idea it's basically you're trying to just map everything out so that you go to the building mode you're not drawing the you know the the blueprint diagram as you build at the same time right you have the blueprint then you build now i mentioned and alluded to some of this stuff earlier but uh one of the things that's really cool about this boot camp is and we're really excited about anyway um is uh we're introducing a bunch of new features and things we haven't done before and um um part of the idea was you know when stellar came to us and said hey you know we've done smaller boot camps before we have a lot of one-on-one stuff but we really want to make it so that each company has a chance so so that a we can bring in a lot more companies and make it more available to the entire sort of community fund uh participants um and folks who are applying and we want to make it so that it interacts so that all of them get to interact and the process is interactive with the entire community which is which is super cool it was a little bit daunting i have to say i think it was like hey guys you know go do go do that and you're like yeah that's gonna be complicated but actually it turned out it was a great idea and uh we're really excited that we that we did it because now we come up with a whole kind of a new system that we think will do those two things a lot better and it's gonna be a lot of fun so a few things to expect from this new approach one is as i've mentioned a couple times there's gonna be help from community members to test ideas get feedback get advice etc and the community members are gonna be kind of like activated and online and available and and kind of looking in you know on what's happening we're like i said we're still exact mechanisms for that are still being developed but one one thing we're trying to do is pair each team with a community member that has relevant expertise and a desire to kind of maybe some you know passion for the area that they're building on and um sort of pair you so you get you get an extra person on your team to kind of give new ideas and help move the process along and and be just like on a sounding board and things like that so that should be pretty cool you get to meet someone new from the community uh another goal of this and like i said you'll be showing uh the outputs of your process as we go along to the community and getting feedback um but but you also of course being at the end kind of showing your final product is a great way to expose what you're doing to the broader community remember the the scf awards uh are are a choice by the community itself not not just the the stellar team and so you really you know you want to expose people to it make sure they know what you're doing and that'll help a lot when it comes time for the for the voting on you know potentially on your project um we've created a bunch of self-directed modules and videos for each step of the sprint process so normally in the past basically i would go up and explain everything uh and then you you know you the sprint participants would do it and with a facilitator now we're trying to make it so you don't need to have a facilitator and you don't need to have me talking to you um although we will have some points where you know myself or somebody from stellar we'll we'll jump in and just kind of talk to the whole group um but we're trying to make it a lot more self-directed so some teams will probably be able to go a little bit faster some may you know want to take more time in a particular area and so make it a lot better for everything for the suspense you won't be forced to move along at the same speed as everybody else we're also going to have kind of some fun gamification quote unquote where you know as the community sees what people are doing uh we're going to kind of create some ways for them to react and and you know promote certain ideas or teams uh ID you know products um we want it to be positive and inclusive not you know like there's no down voting there's only uploading but um you know and there'll be a lot of ways in which to get recognized not not just like you know does everyone like this or not but like you know the most improved or the kind of the coolest ideas in different different kind of categories and all that kind of stuff and uh stellar has been generous enough to give small amount of money for cash prizes so some of the winners in different categories are going to take a little bit of cash home in your pocket it's not not you know not tons not it's not retirement money but um you know just a small amount to kind of like uh get people's blood going a little bit make sure everyone's engaged and uh trying to put your best foot forward we're also gonna have global time zone coverage so basically uh you can do this sprint from anywhere in the world and we will have facilitators available at least one um facilitator and hopefully one uh technical person available at all times basically which should be exciting and a lot again it'll allow us to have companies from all over you know entrants from all over the world who participate uh and to be a lot more participants last time i think we had nine um and this time i don't know how many we're gonna have but it's looking like you know 30 40 1950 so um so yeah it's gonna be exciting it's gonna be uh it's gonna be cool there's gonna be a lot of different ideas and products and cool new technologies so we're definitely looking forward to it so after all that um you know this slide just kind of gives you the very basic boil down boiled down version of what to expect you come in with an idea and a problem you want to solve and you leave with a validated prototype product and maybe some cash so it's a really valuable uh experience and if you've ever done a sprint um you'll know what i mean because almost everybody who goes through them is like oh i'm gonna do another one right away uh and if nothing else you'll learn the methodology and um and you'll take it home with you and you can you can do it again so um gift i'm gonna hand it back to you thanks everybody i don't know do we shoot you guys want any questions or other questions maybe that i should answer i haven't been um so yeah there are actually a bunch of questions on the q and a chats but um let's give room for emmanuel to um share their experience as i mentioned earlier emmanuel um was a past you know participant at one of the bootcamps we had and you know also one of the winners same with the crop the cash team so they will pretty much be sharing what their what their experience was like as well as um maybe also give us a bit of you know what they've been up to since the boot camp um so yeah over to your manual should i um should i stop sharing are you guys gonna go on video so people can see you live or sorry gif we lost you should i stop sharing yes you can stop sharing yeah where are you guys okay i can go now yes you can all right awesome thank you so much gifts um thanks so much i felt like what would coffee came while he was giving the presentation a lot of um um you know not started like just how many months um by the way my name is aristic manuel i'm the ceo and the co-founder of link we are building with three crossroads premise infrastructure for africa we are opportunity to be part of the dfs lab and um bootcamp um probably at the beginning of the year around april really was really fun experience for us i you know i told when i spoke to anchor last i was like um that was the highlight of the year for us really got the ball rolling borrowing towards us building products towards relieving us going going going to market um i think with my for my team i think one of the things we would really um always remember were um really stepping back really taking a breath of the whole experience right to really understand because when we came into the bootcamp we had built just a piece of stuff around on the stellar blockchain so we're quite confident we're like okay you know what we can you know skip the chase and go straight um to day three or you know the fourth day five to them would be but um you know we had an awesome facilitator i was really able to walk us through day by day from the springs we got to ask ourselves the toughest questions from the sprints to the crazy eights i think crazy eights uh whenever we get crazy ate and it really um made us understand what we are building who are building for so until today um one of the the things that we were able to take out from the boots camp really informs our decision even around product deployments even around understanding ui ux and really trying to understand okay yeah if you have a button there um would that be a ux problem or how long um is your solution compared to maybe an existing solution so you're really thinking about things we went down to marketing so for us was a um really fun experience a great one we got to learn a lot anything just i think it was a week yeah really week um my team really um you know said okay this week we're really going to put our minds in i think after the first day and we really saw how it was but i think it lasted from um 12 p.m at 10 to 5 p.m so it can be a bit exhausting but trust me after after after the full week we're able to absorb a lot out of it learn like we felt like we even knew anything and then from there it really um was a springboard through everything we're able to undo today in fact after me after that i'm just probably or two months later who are part of um the stellar community fund which is by the way like you know doing something together i would put some really awesome stuff and we're winners of that too as well so um yeah so my experiences throughout the bootcamp i would say like like i said the bootcamp was a highlight for us um and really was that a major springboard to most of the things we're able to do today we've had awesome partnerships since after the boot camp with companies in financial space and other financial spaces um in crypto space in and out of africa to really help us enrich our mission like Stellar was beautiful because weather payments still was built for payments and and when you have Stellar helping you really solve those difficult problems and payments in africa and then you have the boots can really shaken in that your idea to really make you understand the things you should really do you're in the right place so yeah thank you very much thank you so much emmanuel um that was really really you know great a great um experience rundown um i'm sure a lot of you know other to be participants would get you know a really good insight on what to expect thank you so much for also taking the time to you know come share your experience um so yeah over to you marvellous uh okay um good day everybody i'm marvelous aquinola a cropster crash member and a participant of the stellar bootcamp around april um in crop to catch a season prospective opportunities at the early stage and seeing through them is one important thing we do not joke with uh the knowledge of having to integrate into our existing platform was mind-blowing a lot of deep thought needed to be put in place i'm forced to see the opportunity that comes with it and to see how we can mitigate the challenges to recommit to get the challenges of integration into our existing platform and also to use to use the use case challenges considering our major targets being mostly uneducated the experience generally was intriguing and challenging at the same time given that there are a lot of there are a lot to achieve and in a little period of time but i would say every time spent was worth it it was an exercise that fostered teamwork as it presented an avenue for us to learn and as well as to network with other people and one thing i admit about the old boat campaign is the watchword that says um get started not perfect and trust me during the process starting this 20 process of starting your imperfections with made perfect and nothing i particularly enjoyed was the structure of the bootcamp especially when uh with the way we had to go from conceptualization of a solution to the implement implementation of what is said of the cell solution and it should be alive by saying we were not faced with a bit of challenges at the very inception of the old project but uh with the help of our personal structure gifts and the moderator of the program rk we were able to get answers to every of our questions although it is expected that every participating member of the team should be in a common room so as to share ideas and be readily available for discussion it is also noteworthy to mention that there was convenience the exp convenience experience weapon space in a boat camp was very great and my take on with after the whole boots camp is that everybody's idea is very significant it doesn't matter how important you may feel our ideas are it will cost us nothing to actually share it with others who knows it might be the spark that is needed to light up other people's idea and i cannot mention how lenient and patient and also optimistic the project anchors at dls towards every individual team so i'd like to say thank you for the opportunity and i wish everyone aspired the very best thank you very much thank you so much marvelous um thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us i see that um some questions have already been answered on the q a already so if you perhaps might have dropped your question um you can go back to the q and a section and just read the answers i see anchor went off like she went off you know to [Laughter] to keep the keyboard running by answering your questions so yeah just feel free to go back there to check um i think we're at this stage where we pretty much just um have the floor open um for closing remarks and um since you know a bunch of the questions has already been answered on the q a um chat so yeah over to you um jake and anka yeah i actually uh thank you jake for answering i think there is a comment as i was reading through everything yeah i think there's a common thread it's like especially like for existing or like you know that because like scf right it's not only for new projects that are completely new to stellar um but it's also for those who are already a bit further ahead or even a bit further and are like you know submitting a new product on stellar for example that they're thinking about so jake um like kind of like is like how would the approach be different for these different types of um can they also still like get value can people that are existing also still get value out of the boot camp yeah totally and actually the boot camp in the design square methodology works across any uh level of organization we've um we've done with unicorns who have massive product suites that are already you know processing billions of dollars per year and uh they still you know they have product challenges as well they can define a problem that they want to solve they have you know somewhere in their product flow something's not working the way they want it to work they want to you know ideate test some new things build a prototype of that new feature the cool thing for companies that already have some version of a product built is often you can use either screenshots or if you've already done some prototyping you can modify those prototypes so you get really realistic prototypes sometimes being embedded in stuff that already exists within your product and then just test something that's new relative to what you've already built so yeah definitely doesn't matter what stage you're at this is definitely useful still even if you're further on yeah yeah i would i would agree it's like it's just a methodology it's not just like oh it's not just kickstarting your um uh product and stuff because obviously like you cannot just like build a whole product in a week but it's really like singling out this like most pressing problem uh that you choose to solve in those few weeks and then you get facilitators like that have experience you get community like ecosystem partners that might be able to help you and you can get um like developers on stellar helping helping with answering any type of like challenges technically that you encounter so um yeah like another like thing that i noticed here is that people are like oh are you like building a proof of concept or like an mvp after um after the like bootcamp so jake like what do you what do you generally see bootcamp participants walk away with after participating in the bootcamp well they're usually building a prototype and i and with the with the proof of concept on the back end so uh it's like usually kind of a design you know some sort of design front end and that uh creates a user experience and that can be done in all kinds of different medium you know figma power we use powerpoint um anything you know really just depends what you're comfortable with or where you and uh and then usually it's got a proof of concept sort of technical integration on the back end so that you can actually make the the machine and the machinery that needs to work behind the scenes kind of just at least do the basics right now it's not performance ready and that kind of stuff but you're just yeah proof of concept on the back end side so it's a combination of those two things and um the you know the idea is that that really helps you move you know in only three days you've been able to test both the validity with the customer facing um you know sort of prototype uh design experience prototype and then also test the technical validity so it's really that's the idea is that it's very accelerated way to be able to make a decision as to whether that's the way you want to go or maybe didn't work out how you thought and you avoid having to build a whole you know minimum bible product before before knowing that it's not going to work yeah that makes a lot of sense um i'm i'm uh trying to uh let's see uh answer everything i think we we answered most of those things um let's see how many oh yeah so for the amount of projects we are aiming about um like to see if we can get about 30 to 40 for the boot camp depending on how many submissions we get we just have to see uh usually like for an entire like scf round we're trying to get around 50 because that's usually the maximum amount um someone can review like at all it's already a lot trust me um but for like and that will be like you know until the final october that uh 30 deadline but we're expecting to have most of our submissions before the boot camp because the bootcamp can really elevate your uh presence in the stellar community fund round um yeah i mean i think uh i think i think that makes sense is anyone if anyone has any last-minute questions put them into the q a now maybe we'll be able to answer them but uh jake i'm gonna give the floor to you well um we don't uh not much else to cover there's a few things here on the screen you can see um some next step stuff there's some links and i think we're going to share this powerpoint if i'm not mistaken so but um you know definitely go read more about the stellar community fund obviously if you're applying you should read about it um but it's a really cool concept that stellar has come up with the whole community fund idea so um go take a look and learn more uh complete your submission before september 25th to be considered for the boot camp and um plan to come and give it all if you are participating if you're selected to participate so um yeah that's hopefully giving you all good sense of what to expect and and what are the motivations and why what you would get out of it and why to go and yeah i hope to see you all there awesome bye guys thank you emmanuel and marvelous too and thank you to your festlab team for participating thank you for bringing looking forward hi hi everybody

On September 16, 2022, the Stellar Development Foundation hosted "Info Session for SCF#11 Startup Bootcamp", a session for the global community. Builders traded notes on Info, Startup, and Bootcamp.

hi everybody um actually can you allow me to present my or to to uh share my screen here or the host i can help you share from my end if that's okay i think i can okay i can share as well um great welcome everybody as as gift said we're going to introduce you um to dfs lab but more importantly the boot camp and what to expect from the event coming up and um inca from stuller

Key discussion threads:

- Info anchored the session as speakers compared real-world examples.
- Practical demos highlighted how Startup applies to Stellar builders.
- Attendees outlined next steps around Bootcamp for upcoming releases.

[00:00] Hi everybody. Actually, can you allow me to present my or to share my screen here, or the host? I can help you share from my end. If that's okay, I think I can. Okay, I can share as well. Great welcome everybody. As gift said, we're going to introduce you to DFS Lab but, more importantly, the bootcamp and what to expect from the event. Coming up, and inca from Stellar is also going to say a few things about how bootcamp fits into their, the community fund, and also you know a little bit about what to expect from their side. So here's our

[01:00] Agenda. We'll give you kind of a quick overview of SDF- and it's something fun, little bianca- and then I'll give you a bit more about the bootcamp. So just to kind of quickly give you an introduction to who we are at DFS Lab. We we're an early stage investor in the African tech scene. We invest very early, often at precede, in startups that are digitizing the African economy. So we invest in a lot of marketplaces, e-commerce, B2B e-commerce, social commerce, and everything along kind of the value chain of commerce, in Africa. And we have kind of a. We're a very research driven, thesis based investor and our belief is that, you know, while a lot of attention is being paid to fintech and some of the other areas that investors are excited about, we think the real prize is actually using some of those tools to digitize the economy, root and branch and go from kind of cache based and offline to digital based and online.

[02:00] So you can tell. Because of that, belief, you can probably understand why you know, we're very aligned with Stellar, because I think they have kind of a similar belief around, you know, digitizing the economy and making finance seamless and online and all that. So, and we're, as an investor, we're very hands on we don't call ourselves an accelerator program because we don't do batches with kind of a fixed curriculum. We actually focus on the individual needs of each company. But we're very hands on we spend. We have, you know, a few folks dedicated full time basically to supporting our portfolio companies and we're basically there to help them usually go from the early precede phase to their first seed round. That's where we generally tend to intervene and we can't say too much about it yet. But

[03:00] There's more coming in the partnership area between us and Stellar around. You know how we can help support more companies with more funding and things like that. So I can't say too much about it yet, but should be some exciting stuff coming up in the future. So that's us. We have team in Nairobi. That's gift, and also Joseph, who who's there as well. But we also have people in Kenya and south Africa. I'm in paris, steven, other partners in san francisco, and we bring a whole host of different skills. I won't go into everything, but I think that gives you a little bit of a an intro to who we are as an organization. I could do you want to take over for a sec and give us a little bit more background on Stellar and the community fund? Sure thing, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, so for everyone who doesn't know me- and it's neon desk. My name is ankur and I'm a program manager at the steli development foundation, or SDF, or short bar. We're going to say a

[04:00] Lot of abbreviations today: SDF, scf- so just preparing you for that. And so SDF is a non-profit organization with a mission to create equitable access to the global financial system and as a non-profit we shepherd the development and growth of Stellar, which is a decentralized, open source layer, one blockchain network that connects the world's financial infrastructure. So Stellar is really a back end, so to speak, to power apps and services, where anyone can issue, store, transfer and trade all sorts of assets. Seller also has built in like account logic for creating accounts and assets, signing transactions and tracking balances. Overall, like Stellar is really purposely designed to streamline financial services and really unlock the world's economic potential by making money more fluid, markets more open and people more empowered. So there is like an exterior is an open source,

[05:00] Which means that anyone can build whatever they desire on the network with no application or permission needed. And speaking of building on Stellar, I lead a program called the Stellar community fund, or scf for short, the second abbreviation- which is an open application, a grant program hosted by us that serves us the springboard for many businesses and developers building on Stellar to turn their concepts into tangible products and services based on input from the Stellar community. We've- actually it's quite an old fund, like we're together with our predecessor. It's been around since about like 2016 and has distributed almost 200 million XLM, which is Stellar's native currency, to hundreds of seller based projects based on community input. So that's pretty exciting. You know what's different? I know that there are many grants out there for

[06:00] Blockchain. So what makes us different? Three reasons. So on, at scf, all kinds of use cases and project scope sizes are welcome and where other grants may primarily focus on innovation, on traditional like services, scf also funds like DeFi, NFTs, community education and developer tool projects. Also, the community is actively involved in guiding and supporting the projects, as well as voting for the projects they want to see earn a grant. Also fun fact, scf grants have no strings attached, so this means that grant recipients decide how to spend their grant and don't need to pay anything back. So pretty sweet, I would say so. Saf really operates biannually in form of rounds, and right now the scf is welcoming submissions for its 11th iteration. It's been 11 rounds already with a

[07:00] Total excellent pool of 8 million. So any developer, team or company building on seller can submit to the scf and request funding up to about like 200 a thousand dollars worth of XLM, which depends on their project's code. Aside from funding, participating in scf allows you to gather useful feedback from the community, gain traction in the ecosystem and also opens up unique opportunities for growth. So, yeah, and for the first time ever, let's skip, let's go to the next slide, jake. Yeah, for the first time ever, submissions that get selected to participate in the scf and are eligible to participate in bootcamp can announce now participating- sorry, can now participate in a virtual startup bootcamp from November 1 to four. That will really like kick start their journey on

[08:00] Stellar or even, if you're already in Stellar ecosystem, like help with a particular problem that you haven't been able to solve before, with the help of experts and facilitators from both SDF, DFS Lab and the community. So, yeah, over the course of a few days, participants will work with these facilitators to find a problem, storyboard a solution and develop a rapid prototype before getting feedback from the Stellar community fund, from the Stellar community, But jake will tell you much more about that. Just so you know before, if you want to get considered for participation, submit your style based project to the staff before September 25th, and this is a little over a week, so it's really coming up. So that is the deadline before September 25th also. I saw some questions in the, in the Q&A section here on the Zoom. So definitely add your

[09:00] Questions there and we'll have a little a q, a session, like right after everything, like at the end of the session. Right, that's all from me and yeah, jake, take it away. Thank you okay. Yeah, that was great. So yeah, I'm gonna give you kind of an overview of what to expect if you come to this event. And we're really excited about it. We always. We've done a couple of these with Stellar already in the past and they're super fun for us because we get to see new companies who are, you know, often new to Stellar. They're trying to create, you know, some kind of an innovation or crack some difficult challenge in the financial services space, and it's a very kind of a intense interaction where we really get to go deep in what they're trying to build, what their challenges are, you know, etc. We

[10:00] Get to meet their team and all, etc. We of thing, and so we really like that kind I think the seller team them, and for the same reasons. You know, if you just really get to dive in- and for us it's also great that we get to be hands on with each company, so we're not just kind of like lecturing about, you know, the future of fintech and all that kind of stuff. When you go to a normal conference, the bootcamp is really you and your team coming and doing work in a really intensive but structured way, with help from a whole bunch of different people- us, experts, Stellar, etc. So it's not- it's definitely not- something you want to think about like a typical conference or something like that. It's really you working on your product, which is, you know, which is what you should be doing if you're running a. So I'm going to start with kind of just high level. You know almost like the philosophy of a design sprint, right? So some of you probably done design sprints. You know we didn't invent them and we won't be the last to use them. But we

[11:00] Have kind of our own version of the design sprint that we do and the real idea is that you test and prototype a solution in just five days. And you start with: you know a problem, you define, you know the challenge that you're trying to overcome, and then we have kind of a step by step process, once you've defined that problem, to go from there to a realistic prototype that you can put in front of users and get their reaction. And that's the critical thing about a sprint- the design sprints- is you're trying to avoid building an actual product, which sounds weird, right, like why are we teaching you or why are we encouraging you to avoid building product? Everyone else is telling you, yeah, build product, that's the most important thing. But what's important is actually to build product that people want, and this approach of a design sprint is a way to fast forward into the future and say, okay, how are people reacting to this product before we've actually built it? So we don't have

[12:00] To waste the time building it if they don't react in the way we hope, and it's a great methodology. There's a few links here. You can read more about it. I encourage you to do that. But that's the fundamental philosophy of what we're trying to accomplish with this and you'll be surprised how realistic a prototype you can build. So here's the process. Now some of you have done, you know, sprints based on the sprint book which we had to link to, on the last slide or some of the other methodologies. This will look a little bit different, but it's okay. You know a lot of the same steps are there and the same fundamental outcome is there. So, because we kind of have limited time and we're planning to- we're assuming that there's going to be a large number of participants- we're going to try and have each participant team define the problem they're trying to solve before you show up. So that'll be important to know is that, you know, spend a little bit of time before we

[13:00] Start on day one, actually figuring out and defining a problem. We're going to send you some exercises to do to make sure that you've actually done that, because it's actually kind of a common problem we see with product designers and founders where they'll say, oh, I know what the problem is, but they actually haven't thought it through in enough detail to really have a high resolution version of the problem. So that's what we're going to ask you to do before the event starts. Day one will then be to say, okay, let's take the problem that we have, map out what the sort of- you know, original customer journey is and think through where in that customer journey we might want what do you sort of current or standard- you know industry standard- customer journey, and then where in that customer journey or that sort of experience do we want to intervene with the prototype that we're creating today, right? So that's day one. It's really mapping out the problem in high level detail and figuring out

[14:00] Where we want to intervene. Day two- and I'm going to show you some examples of each of these in the next few slides. so basically, you'll come up with a map and I'll show you the map in a second right. Day two, you're gonna focus on which solutions you know you wanna use in your intervention and you're gonna generate actually a whole bunch of solution ideas, you know. So you kind of widen the funnel of ideas before you then narrow down on which particular one you think is the best. And that process of widening and creating new ideas we have a whole bunch of- well, not a whole bunch, but we have a few steps and exercises to do to make sure that you really stimulate your creativity and bring in, you know, the best ideas from the team and make sure that you don't jump on the first idea that comes, you know, comes to mind, but you actually explore really deeply this set of ideas, space in your head that you know sort of the set of the possible, if you will. And then

[15:00] We have a similar set of exercises where, okay, now all the team has kind of put all the ideas out there. Now we're going to narrow down using some anonymous voting and some ways of giving feedback that try to avoid biasing the solution based on who's the most convincing or who the feedback comes from. Often, you know, people think that you know, because the CEO said, oh, I like this one, then that's what we should do, and at the end of the day, the CEO probably has to make the decision. But we do think that it's better to make sure that everyone's kind of perspective and thought process is kind of treated equally in the initial part, so that you know you kind of narrow down the designs based on best thinking and not on who's, you know, the most senior or the most convincing. You know, some people just have a great way of putting it but that may not be the best idea. So day two is really going to be about focusing down on, okay, what's the sort of

[16:00] Product approach and solution that we want to create. The next step after that- and that's kind of end of day two going into day three- is first, you're gonna storyboard your prototype. They're pretty high level of detail. Now, people always want to resist this. They, you know they found their idea on day two. They want to jump right in and build it, but we really push back on that. It's not a good idea, and the reason it's not is because, basically, when you jump in and try to build something, you think you know what you're building, because you've got this idea in your head, but that idea doesn't have enough detail to actually be a coherent feature on your product. And so what happens is you start building, you build, you know part a and part c and part f, and then you realize you gotta fill in the other stuff. And as you start to fill in the

[17:00] Other stuff that you weren't thinking about, you know, when you just kick the thing off, you realize that I've got to redo part a because it doesn't fit together better. You know it didn't fit together well or doesn't make sense. Now that I've thought through part b and you start creating kind of a non linear problem to solve, where now everything is interrelated and you have to change this when they have to change this and slows you way down and you end up having to often sometimes just completely restart and do the whole thing from the beginning. Right, most of you probably experience that at some point when you're dealing with a complex system like a product, right? So what we say we encourage people to do- is spend the time. It only takes a, maybe two hours to really create a detailed storyboard that says okay, at each step. Here's what we're going to do. Right, there's going to be a button. That button is going to take you here. You know it's going to. You're going to do something. You're going to put in some data. You're going to. do, right, all that stuff will be thought out, including pretty high level detail on content, if there is

[18:00] Any. So if there's wording, if there's text, if there's images, you can say, okay, we need an image here. We need to. You know we need some wording here. Then you go into the prototyping phase. You've got a. really detailed map, you know, that says, hey, you're going to do it's just like a recipe that you follow and you are going to be so much faster in building your prototype if you've got that recipe laid out or that storyboard. So, and then in the prototyping phase, that'll be day three and it'll actually kind of, you know, go beyond day three a little bit. You'll have a bit of extra time on day four as well, where you'll be prototyping. You will have support from us, but in particular, you have support from the Stellar team. There'll be some engineer folks who you know the apis and all the ins and outs of the, of all the different seller technology, so that

[19:00] You know you won't get hung up, so that read through documentation and things like that. I mean their documentation is actually quite good, of course, but in any case they'll be folks who can help, you know, live in person as well. And there's gonna be the whole community and I'm gonna get into that in a second. This is just kind of the sprint aspect. There's gonna be a kind of a whole extra layer around all this, which is the community part of it. So, once you're done with your prototype, you're gonna get in. You're gonna then test it with users, and that's actually something new we're doing this time. If any of you were at the previous bootcamp, we didn't do that, but it's supposed to be a integral part of the sprint. It's very, it's actually the most important part. In fact, it's really why you do a sprint, a design sprint, in the first place, which is to, you know, find out what people think. And again, we're gonna have kind of an integrated process where people

[20:00] From the community can be your user and give you feedback on how you know how the experience goes when they use your product or test the feature or what have you. And so you're, we're gonna do some workshops on how to do that testing in a way that doesn't bias your user. It's very easy to bias someone who's testing a product or a feature and they're kind of looking at you see, like you know how do you feel when they do x or y. They don't want to hurt your feelings if it's clear that you're the one who built this thing. You know they don't want to say it's terrible, or that they don't like it. Or they give you a bunch of really positive feedback but it's not. You know it's not real. It's not their real gut reaction. So, and there's a lot of other ways you can buy us. You know, by the way you present it, by the way you talk about it, by the way you know the situation you put the person in. So we've got, we're gonna. We have a workshop plan where we're gonna give you some tools

[21:00] So that you know how to do some tools, test session with a prototype and how to collect the feedback and how to organize that feedback into sort of a useful output. So that's the basic sort of step by step process of the sprint itself and you know it, like I said, it's a lot of fun. It's very kind of both draining and energizing, because it's pretty intense. There's a lot of steps and you use in your brain a lot and you kind of dump out all your creativity and make decisions and then build stuff. It's pretty cool and what we see is that often within the within each company, not only does it help, you know really rapidly go from you know some particular problem you're having with your user base or your you know user experience or whatever it is, or you're trying to, you know improve, or if you're fundamentally new, maybe you're just trying

[22:00] To build a very basic first version of the product. If you don't have one yet, it really you know it definitely helps do that really quickly and in a way that, like I said, is based on user feedback and so much more validated and much more likely to result in the final product that you built. You know being useful and liked by your users. But it's often also a way- because you spend, because you're so focused and intensively working on your product and you're doing it in the context of seeing a lot of other teams do their products, think through their challenges and solutions, etc. You're interacting with a lot of people who you don't interact with on a daily basis but who are, you know, experts in this area. You know our mentors and facilitators, us, the Stellar team, the community members. You're gonna have some. Really. I think most of the time we see teams having these really interesting kind of revelations about their strategy, their product, you know, their pathway to market, their distribution, all those other things that don't necessarily fit

[23:00] Directly into the storyboard that you know or the product that you're prototyping, but that fit in around it. So it's a, it's a really around it. So it's a really valuable process, I think, and we see a lot of companies getting a lot of value out of it. I wanted to just kind of quickly give some examples just to illustrate what I was talking about. So remember I talked about first day- you draw out the pathway, the user pathway, and then you figure out where you want to focus and intervene. So this was a, this was one from a customer who was doing a cash in, cash out at a mobile money agent network in Kenya, and you can see kind of all the different process steps that are going on. You know they're entering their number, they're talking to the agent and I won't go through everything. And then the team wanted to forward on- sorry, wanted to focus on these two areas that are circled in green. So that was sort of the end of their first day, basically, of sprint. They came out. You know this

[24:00] Is what they come up, know this other steps and other things they created, but you know this was kind of the main final output and it basically guides the creation of their solutions the following days to say, okay, we know the process that where we fit in and we know what we want to change. That's essentially what you come out of day one with and what we're going to do. We're still kind of fine tuning how we're going to have the interactions with the community members and things like that, but we are going to find a way that you can, we are present and show this to the community, probably via Discord, and either get feedback- people may vote on which kind of problem you know problem diagram and problem choice that they like the best, et cetera. So we're going to have some kind of like really cool ways where you can interact with the Stellar community and really get, you know, even more feedback and more ideas and

[25:00] More sort of expert help with what you're doing. So this is the output of day two, or it's one example anyway, and what you can see here is we got this three pages. I think each one is supposed to be a looks like an app screen on a phone maybe, and you know, you're just kind of going through a sign- looks like a sign up process, right. There's a sign up button on the first page and then there's a- you know, looks like there's some marketing lingo on the second page. So it's kind of an onboarding process, right. The next one is maybe a text message based interface. So anyway, you know, I don't know exactly what this storyboard was supposed to be, but it was supposed to be an onboarding process for a savings app. And you can also see how there's these blue and pink dots. You're probably like: why are those all over the place? So that's part of one of the steps in the process is people on

[26:00] The team and also other people outside of the team can vote on which things they like best and which things they like. You know that they think should go into the final version of the prototype and that's non bonding you know, it's kind of like a thumbs up on facebook or claps on medium. You know it's just kind of like people express their opinion and that gives you kind of this heat map of like: oh boy, there's a bunch of dots over here on the. You know, in some part we should probably keep that. And there's no dots in this, upright. No, people didn't seem to care about that part, so maybe we can cut it out, or something like that. And eventually you'll have a couple of these, because each, you know, there'll be more than one of these storyboards. Initially, as remember, I said we're going to first start with a bunch of ideas and then narrow it down. Eventually, the decider on the team will they make a choice and they may choose one storyboard or one sort of three page you know thing, or they might reconfigure and mix and

[27:00] Match. You can do whatever you want, but the idea is to use this heat map and the feedback that you've got from the team to kind of choose. Okay, we're going to do this particular idea for an onboarding or for a transaction process or whatever you're doing, yeah, so that's the first thing, that, again, community is going to get involved. Here too, same as before. We're still kind of fine tuning how exactly that's going to work, but they're you're going to be able to kind of show and get feedback on some of this stuff and we're going to have, I think, some prizes and voting on, like you know, best ideas and things like that. So day three, I believe, will produce this storyboard. So this is an example of storyboard. I was talking about it's not super pretty, you can see, but it gets the job done. So essentially, these are supposed to be a series of app screens. You know you can see the wireframes and in a few cases they just photographed hand drawn

[28:00] Diagrams and put them straight in there. That's totally acceptable and cool. Then they also put, you know, you can see- kind of the step by step with the yellow sticky notes, where each one kind of says: you know what's happening at each step and you get a little bit of the kind of the menu options and things like that, and you know, basically it's kind of like a transaction flow on some level. And so this is, you know, doesn't have to be that. You know that you don't have tons and tons of detail, as long as you know what's happening on each page and all the pages that you have to build and how they kind of interconnect to each other. You know that's what you need to get done, and once you have that then it's really easy. Then you just you know, then you're just heads down, you're building. The other thing we usually do is wire diagram for the transaction process that's happening on the back end and that's you know where you're gonna be interfacing with the different parts of the Stellar system and you're in your own. You know your own system

[29:00] As well if you have one, and so this usually helps kind of clarify both the information and money flow. If you know if it's a financial transaction of some kind that's happening on the back end- not everyone needs to do one of these, but most people do. It's usually a valuable exercise, doesn't take very long. But again, same idea. It's basically you're trying to just map everything out so that you go to the building mode. You're not drawing the. You know the blueprint diagram as you build at the same time, right, you have the blueprint, then you build. Now I mentioned and alluded to some of this stuff earlier, but one of the things that's really cool about this bootcamp is- and we're really excited about anyway- is we're introducing a bunch of new features and things we haven't done before. And part of the idea was, you know, when Stellar came to us and said, hey, you know, we've done smaller bootcamps before, we have a

[30:00] Lot of one on one stuff, but we really want to make it so that each company has a chance, so that a we can bring in a lot more companies and make it more available to the entire sort of community fund participants and folks who are applying, and we want to make it so that it interacts, so that all of them get to interact and the process is interactive with the entire community, which is super cool. It was a little bit daunting, I have to say I think it was like, hey guys, you know, go do that. And you're like, yeah, that's gonna be complicated, but actually it turned out. It was a great idea and we're really excited that we did it because now we come up with a whole kind of a new system that we think will do those two things a lot better and it's gonna be a lot of fun. So a few things to expect from this new approach. One is, as I've mentioned a couple times, there's gonna be help from community members to test ideas, get feedback, get advice, etc. And the community members are gonna be kind of like activated and online and available and kind of looking in, you know, on what's happening. We're, like

[31:00] I said, we're still exact. We're, like that are still being developed. But one thing we're trying to do is pair each team with a community member that has relevant expertise and a desire to kind of maybe some you know- passion for the area that they're building on and sort of pair you so you get an extra person on your team to kind of give new ideas and help move the process along and be just like on a sounding board and things like that. So that should be pretty cool. You get to meet someone new from the community- another goal of this and, like I said, you'll be showing the outputs of your process as we go along to the community and getting feedback. But you also, of course, being at the end kind of showing your final product is a great way to expose what you're doing to the broader community. Remember, the scf awards are a choice by the community itself, not just the Stellar team, and so you really you know you want to expose people to it, make sure they know what you're doing, and that'll help a lot when it comes time for the voting on,

[32:00] You know, potentially on your project. We've created a bunch of self directed modules and videos for each step of the sprint process. So normally in the past, basically I would go up and explain everything and then you know you, the sprint participants, would do it, and with a facilitator. Now we're trying to make it so you don't need to have a facilitator and you don't need to have me talking to you, although we will have some points where you know myself or somebody from Stellar, we'll jump in and just kind of talk to the whole group. But we're trying to make it a lot more self directed so some teams will probably be able to go a little bit faster. Some may, you know, want to take more time in a particular area, and so make it a lot better for everything, for the suspense you won't be forced to move along at the same speed as everybody else. We're also going to have kind of some fun gamification, quote, unquote- where, you know, as the community sees what people are doing, we're going to kind of create some ways for them to react and, you know, promote certain ideas or teams, ID, you know, products.

[33:00] We want it to be positive and inclusive, not, you know, like there's no down voting, there's only uploading. But you know, and there'll be a lot of ways in which to get recognized, not just, like you know, does everyone like this or not, but like you know the most improved or the kind of the coolest ideas in different kind of categories and all that kind of stuff. And Stellar has been generous enough to give small amount of money for cash prizes. So some of the winners in different categories are going to take a little bit of cash home in your pocket. it's not, you know not tons, not, it's not retirement money, but you know just a small amount to kind of like get people's blood going a little bit, make sure everyone's engaged and trying to put your best foot forward. We're also gonna have global time zone coverage. So, basically, you can do this sprint from anywhere in the world and we will have facilitators available- at least one facilitator and hopefully one technical person

[34:00] Available at all times, basically, which should be exciting- and a lot again it'll allow us to have companies from all over, you know, entrants from all over the world who participate, and to be a lot more participants. Last time, I think we had nine, and this time I don't know how many we're gonna have, but it's looking like, you know, 30, 40, 1950. So, yeah, it's gonna be exciting, it's gonna be cool. There's gonna be a lot of different ideas and products and cool new technologies. So we're definitely looking forward to it. So, after all that, you know, this slide just kind of gives you the very basic boil down, boiled down version of what to expect. You come in with an idea and a problem you want to solve and you leave with a validated prototype product and maybe some cash. So it's a really valuable experience and if you've ever done a sprint, you'll know what I mean, because almost you'll know

[35:00] What I mean, because almost everybody who goes through them is like, oh, I'm gonna do another one right away and, if nothing else, you'll learn the methodology and you'll take it home with you and you can do it again. So, gift, I'm gonna hand it back to you. Thanks everybody. I don't know. Do we shoot you guys want any questions or other questions? Maybe that I should answer? I haven't been, So, yeah, there are actually a bunch of questions on the Q&A chats, but let's give room for emmanuel to share their experience. As I mentioned earlier, emmanuel was a past, you know, participant at one of the bootcamps we had and you know also one of the winners, same with the crop, the cash team. So they will pretty much be sharing what their experience was like, as well as maybe also give us a bit of you know what they've been up to since the bootcamp. So, yeah,

[36:00] Over to your manual. Should I stop sharing? Are you guys gonna go on video so people can see you live? Or, sorry, gif, we lost you. Should I stop sharing? Yes, you can stop sharing. Yeah, where are you guys? Okay, I can go now. Yes, you can all. Right, awesome, thank you so much. Gifts- thanks so much. I felt like what would? Coffee came while he was giving the presentation. A lot of you know not started like just how many months. By the way, my name is aristic manuel. I'm the CEO and the co-founder of link. We are building with three crossroads premise infrastructure for Africa. We are opportunity to be part of the DFS Lab and bootcamp, probably at the beginning of the year around April, really was really fun experience for us. I, you know

[37:00] I told when I spoke to anchor. I, you know like that was the last. I was like that was the highlight of the year for us- really got the ball rolling, borrowing towards us building products, towards relieving us, going to market. I think with my for my team, I think one of the things we would really always remember were really stepping back, really taking a breath of the whole experience, right to really understand, because when we came into the bootcamp, we had built just a piece of stuff around on the Stellar blockchain. So we're quite confident. We're like, okay, you know what we can, you know, skip the chase and go straight to day three or, you know, the fourth day- five to them would be. But you know, we had an awesome facilitator. I was really able to walk us through day by day, from the springs- we got to ask ourselves the toughest questions, from the sprints to the crazy eights- I think crazy eights- whenever we get crazy ate- and it really made us understand

[38:00] What we are building, who are building for. So, until today, one of the things that we were able to take out from the boots camp really informs our decision, even around product deployments, even around understanding ui, ux and really trying to understand: okay, yeah, if you have a button there, would that be a ux problem? Or how long is your solution compared to, maybe, an existing solution? So you're really thinking about things. We went down to marketing. So for us was a really fun experience, a great one. We got to learn a lot- anything just. I think it was a week, yeah, really week. My team, really, you know, said, okay, this week we're really going to put our minds in. I think after the first day and we really saw how it was, but I think it lasted from 12 p m at 10 to 5 p m so it can be a bit at 10 to 5 p m so it can be a bit exhausting. But trust me, after the full week we're able to absorb a lot out of it, learn like we felt, like

[39:00] We even knew anything, and then from there it really was a springboard through everything we're able to undo today. In fact, after me, after that I'm just probably, or two months later- who are part of the Stellar community fund, which is, by the way, like you know, doing something together, I would put some really awesome stuff, and we're winners of that too as well. So, yeah, so, my experiences throughout the bootcamp, I would say, like I said, the bootcamp was a highlight for us and really was that a major springboard to most of the things we're able to do today. We've had awesome partnerships since after the bootcamp with companies in financial space and other financial spaces, in crypto space, in and out of Africa, to really help us enrich. Our mission like Stellar was beautiful because weather payments still was built for payments and when you have Stellar helping you really solve, those difficult problems and payments in Africa, and then you have the boots, can really shaken in that your idea to really make you

[40:00] Understand the things you should really do. You're in the right place. So, yeah, thank you very much. emmanuel. That was really- you know- great, a great experience rundown. I'm sure a lot of you know other to be participants would get you know a really good insight on what to expect. Thank you so much for also taking the time to you know, come share your experience. So, yeah, over to you. Marvellous. Okay, good day everybody. I'm marvelous aquinola, a cropster crash member and a participant of the Stellar bootcamp around April in crop to catch a season prospective opportunities at the early stage and seeing through them is one important thing we do not joke with. The knowledge of having to integrate into our existing platform was mind blowing a

[41:00] Lot of deep thought needed to be put in place. I'm forced to see the opportunity that comes with it and to see how we can mitigate the challenges, to recommit, to get the challenges of integration into our existing platform and also to use the use case challenges, considering our major targets being mostly uneducated, the experience generally was intriguing and challenging at the same time, given that there are a lot of, there are a lot to achieve and in a little period of time, but I would say every time spent was worth. It was an exercise that fostered teamwork, as it presented an avenue for us to learn and as well as to network with other people. And one thing I admit about the old boat campaign is the watchword that says: get started, not perfect, and trust me during the process starting this 20 process of starting your imperfections with made perfect. And nothing I particularly enjoyed was the. Nothing I particularly

[42:00] Enjoyed was the structure of the bootcamp, especially when, with the way we had to go from conceptualization of a solution to the implement, implementation of what is said of the cell solution. And it should be alive by saying we were not faced with a bit of challenges at the very inception of the old project but with the help of our personal structure, gifts and the moderator of the program, rk, we were able to get answers to every of our questions, although it is expected that every participating member of the team should be in a common room so as to share ideas and be readily available for discussion. It is also noteworthy to mention that there was convenience- the exp- convenience experience- weapon space in a boat camp- was very great and my take on with after the whole boots camp is that everybody's idea is very significant. It doesn't matter how important you may feel our ideas are. It will cost us nothing to actually share it with others. Who knows it

[43:00] Might be the spark, that is, who knows it might be the spark that is needed to light up other people's idea. And I cannot mention how lenient and patient and also optimistic the project anchors at dls towards every individual team. So I'd like to say thank you for the opportunity and I wish everyone aspired the very best. Thank you so much, marvelous. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us. I see that some questions have already been answered on the Q&A already. So if you perhaps might have dropped your question, you can go back to the Q&A section and just read the answers. I see anchor went off like she went off, you know, to Laughter to keep the keyboard running by answering your questions. So, yeah, just feel free to go back there to check. I think we're at this stage where we pretty much just

[44:00] Have the floor open for closing remarks and since you know, a bunch of the questions has already been answered on the Q&A chat. So, yeah, over to you, jake and anka. Yeah, I actually, thank you, jake for answering. I think there is a comment as I was reading. through everything. Yeah, I think there's a common thread. It's like especially like for existing or like you know that, because, like scf, right, it's not only for new projects that are completely new to Stellar, but it's also for those who are already a bit further ahead or even a bit further and are, like you know, submitting a new product on Stellar, for example, that they're thinking about. So, jake, like kind of like is like, how would the approach be different for these different types of? Can they also still, like, get value? Can people that are existing also still get value out of the bootcamp? Yeah, totally, and actually the bootcamp in the design square methodology works across any level

[45:00] Of organization. We've done with unicorns who have massive product suites that are already, you know, processing billions of dollars per year and they still, you know they have product challenges as well. They can define a problem that they want to solve. They have, you know, somewhere in their product flow something's not working the way they want it to work. They want to, you know, ideate, test some new things, build a prototype of that new feature. The cool thing for companies that already have some version of a product built is often you can use either screenshots or, if you've already done some prototyping, you can modify those prototypes so you get really realistic prototypes, sometimes being embedded in stuff that already exists within your product and then just test something that's new relative to what you've already built. So, yeah, definitely doesn't matter what stage you're at, this is definitely useful still, even if you're further on. Yeah, I would agree, It's like it's just a methodology. It's not just like, oh, it's not just kickstarting your product and stuff, because obviously, like, you

[46:00] Cannot just like build a whole product in a week, but it's really like singling out this like most pressing problem that you choose to solve in those few weeks. And then you get facilitators like that have experience. You get community like ecosystem partners that might be able to help you, and you can get like developers on Stellar helping with answering any type of like challenges technically that you encounter. So, yeah, like. Another like thing that I noticed here is that people are like: oh, are you like building a proof of concept or like an mvp after the like bootcamp? So, jake, like, what do you generally see bootcamp participants walk away with after participating in the bootcamp? Well, they're usually building a prototype and I and with the proof of concept on the back end. So it's like usually kind of a design, you know, some

[47:00] Sort of design front end and that creates a user experience and that can be done in all kinds of different medium. You know figma power, we use powerpoint. Anything you know really just depends what you're comfortable with or where you, and then usually it's got a proof of concept, sort of technical integration on the back end so that you can actually make the machine and the machinery that needs to work behind the scenes, kind of just at least do the basics. Right now it's not performance ready and that kind of stuff, but you're just, yeah, proof of concept on the back end side. So it's a combination of those two things and the. You know the idea is that really helps you move. You know, in only three days you've been able to test both the validity with the customer facing you know, sort of prototype, design experience, prototype, and then also test the technical validity. So it's really that's the idea is that it's very accelerated way to be able to make a decision as to whether that's the way you want to go or maybe didn't work out how you thought and you avoid having to build a whole, you know, minimum

[48:00] Bible product before knowing that it's not going to work. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I'm trying to- let's see- answer everything. I think we answered most of those things. Let's see how many. Oh yeah, so for the amount of projects we are aiming about like to see if we can get about 30 to 40 for the bootcamp, depending on how many submissions we get, we just have to see. Usually, like, for an entire like scf round, we're trying to get around 50 because that's usually the maximum amount someone can review like at all. It's already a lot, trust me. But for like, and that will be, like you know, until the final October, that 30 deadline. But we're expecting to have most of our submissions before the bootcamp because the bootcamp can really elevate your presence in the Stellar community fund round. Yeah, I mean,

[49:00] I think that makes. I think I think that makes sense. Is anyone? If anyone has any last minute questions. Put them into the Q&A now. Maybe we'll be able to answer them. But, jake, I'm gonna give the floor to you. Well, we don't not much else to cover. There's a few things. Here on the screen you can see some next step stuff. There's some links and I think we're going to share this powerpoint, if I'm not mistaken. So. But you know, definitely go read more about the Stellar community fund. Obviously, if you're applying, you should read about it. But it's a really cool concept that Stellar has come up with the whole community fund idea. So go take a look and learn more, complete your submission before September 25th to be considered for the bootcamp and plan to come and give it all if you are participating, if you're selected to participate. So, yeah, that's hopefully giving you all good sense of what to expect

[50:00] And what are the motivations and why, what you would get out of it and why to go. And, yeah, I hope to see you all there. Awesome bye guys. Thank you, emmanuel, and marvelous too, and thank you to your festlab team for participating. Thank you for bringing looking forward. Hi, everybody.
