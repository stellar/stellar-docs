First we take a look at look at Stellar Lab, a lot of features and improvements have been added since we did a Stellar Lab presentation last year. Stellar Lab is a powerful tool for everyone developing on Stellar.

We are looking for community feedback on the Upgradeable Contracts SEP, and will present the details of this proposal.
