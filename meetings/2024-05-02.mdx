This session featured a walkthrough of Stellar Plus, a JavaScript library presented by Fifo that aims to streamline development across the Stellar ecosystem. The discussion focused on how the library brings together common Stellar and Soroban workflows into a single, composable interface for developers.

Ecosystem feedback highlighted the breadth of functionality covered by Stellar Plus, including account and asset management, WASM-related operations, and Soroban RPC utilities. Participants discussed how this approach can reduce boilerplate and improve developer ergonomics for building applications on Stellar.

### Key Topics
