This session introduced and walked through **Sorobil**, a developer tool designed to make Soroban contract costs and limits more visible and understandable. The discussion focused on how developers can move beyond opaque failures and instead see exactly which protocol limits a contract invocation is hitting.

Using real examples, the presenters demonstrated how Sorobil integrates into local development workflows, helps decode XDR, and provides actionable insight into why transactions fail or become expensive.

### Key Topics

- Sorobil cost visibility tool
  - Overview of the Sorobil CLI/package and its goals
  - Inspecting Soroban contract execution costs in a developer-friendly way
- Measuring contract limits and costs
  - Understanding which limits (CPU, memory, ledger reads/writes) a contract touches
  - Capturing a snapshot of all limits exercised during an invocation
  - Using this data to guide contract optimization
- Local development workflow
  - Deploying contracts and testing invocations against the unlimited quickstart environment
  - Using an unconstrained setup to explore worst-case behavior safely
- XDR decoding and failure analysis
  - Decoding transaction XDR to inspect low-level execution details
  - Using Sorobil to understand why transactions failed
  - Bridging the gap between protocol-level errors and developer intent
- Practical debugging and optimization
  - Identifying cost drivers early in development
  - Utilizing the Sorobil tool to decode XDR and understand failed transactions.
  - Using visibility tooling to avoid surprises when moving toward constrained networks
