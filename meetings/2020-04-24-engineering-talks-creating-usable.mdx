Colton Perdew used this engineering talk to focus on usability instead of protocol minutiae. He outlined the “hard stuff” newcomers hit—on/off ramps, key management, the DEX, anchors, and trustlines—and argued that wallets should treat SEPs as the layer that abstracts those details so product teams can focus on clean user journeys.

He walked through concrete tactics: rely on SEPs (federation, mnemonic derivation, SEP-30 recovery, SEP-6/24 for anchors), wrap the DEX with purpose-built interfaces, narrow the experience to one use case at a time, and educate users before they even sign up (Lobstr’s onboarding screens, localization, etc.). The talk closed with resources such as the Dev Digest for developers who want to follow ongoing SEP work.

Key discussion threads:

- Why SEPs matter when building usable apps—federated addresses, mnemonic backups, SEP-30 recovery, and standard anchor flows.
- How UI decisions (Stellar Laboratory vs. a focused wallet vs. vertical apps like SatoshiPay or Vega) affect whether mainstream users understand the value proposition.
- The role of education and localization: showing value before sign-up, translating copy for target markets, and curating documentation for new developers.

okay I think we're live what's up everybody welcome to this week's edition of stellar engineering talks my name is Colton I'm the community manager here at the cellar development foundation and I am NOT an engineer but I will pretend to be one for the next 30 minutes or so for the sake of conversation this week I'll be talking about creating usable stellar applications and I also wanted to give a reminder that this is a series that
