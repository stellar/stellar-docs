This AMA captured the state of Project Jump Cannon midway through 2022. Justin, Tomer, and Leigh shared the tentative roadmap: experimental futurenet access today, a local sandbox experience landing this month, full testnet late in Q4, and mainnet shortly after validators finish their year-end freeze. They also teased the kinds of apps already scoping deployments-AMMs, lending markets, and tooling for DAOs.

Audience questions zeroed in on developer experience. The hosts described the evolving Rust SDK, upcoming docs, how testing works inside the host runtime, and what it will take to build L2 systems (rollups, DAOs, hybrid apps) on top of Soroban. The conversation served as a reality check for builders planning their first contracts.

Key discussion threads:

- Target timelines for sandbox tooling, futurenet, public testnet, and mainnet activation plus how naming of the network will be decided.
- The types of applications Soroban unlocks compared to today's fixed operation set (custom AMMs, lending, DAOs, trusted bridges).
- SDK maturity, testing harnesses, and the long-term vision for layer-two constructions such as zk-rollups anchored to Stellar.
