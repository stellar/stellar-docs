[00:00] Hi everyone and welcome to this week's Stellar Developer Meeting. This week at Stellar we just concluded the the latest cohort in the incubator collaboration we have with Draperu and I thought since we just wrapped this up and 20 teams teams graduated from from the incubator program I thought it could be interesting to invite someone who went through the program last year. So today I have the the founder of Flashback in the studio. So yeah, please introduce yourself and let us know what you're working on. Hello guys. So my name is Briu. So co-ounder of flashback. And so yeah we were part of this first and initial batch for the draper cross ster unbug program, which was I

[01:00] think between yeah November 2024 to February 2025. And so yeah some just a bit of background about myself. So I have PhD in computer science mainly in machine learning artificial intelligence. So I did, that for seven eight years. Big patient with in AI and all you can use AI you know with cloud technologies and the fact, that today AI is very related to cloud technologies. I got very curious about what we call the decentralized physical infrastructure network the cloud storage cloud computing sovereignty data protection etc etc and of course since 2016 I discovered the cryptocurrency space initially with project like lisk and arc. So very old project I would not say I'm no g. But close to

[02:00] And yeah, I discovered the blockchain more kind of patient and since March 2023, I decided to start my entrepreneurship journey start to to build my first solution, which was a decentralized storage network. Trying to in fact build something for fast data retrieval. Because if you are trying. If you already tried you know fon iwave it's made for archival data. But once you want to do what storage and to use it in a very frequent way is not very compatible for this kind of usage. So we wanted to step and to try to build something there. But you know building solution going through for one year and a half we understood like we talking with thousand of I was hundred and thousand of funders with different conferences par blockchain week ETH progCC progCC token 2049 we discover quickly, that yes

[03:00] in fact flashback was born from an simple problem it's a vunderlooking problem everyone is facing, that. But yeah. If you want custom I have a small presentation to help people to go through. Through. Yeah let's let's go to the presentation. Presentation. Okay. Okay just to be sure it's PDF. Okay, it's loading. Here it is. Okay. Okay. So, yes, Flashback is an AI power code defecification solution.

[04:00] So we want to be this unified interface for developers and companies to be able to diversify with centralized and decentralized cloud providers. We want make we want to make it cheaper, simpler and more flexible to you to deeper your data storage and in fact make the mic cloud journey something, that you can start at the beginning of your entrepreneurship or. When you want to start to build a project. So in fact basically we have the large vendors you know Google cloud AWS Microsoft Azure they are fast and reliable we know them well they have a lot of stacks. But the thing is, that they're very expensive I think we know we as a developer we know this me of. If you want to justify your please you just have to say AWS it's very well known very difficult to understand all you are doing your expenses is and at the same time most of the company. When they started to deploy with one provider they depose. So much solution on

[05:00] the top, that they have this fun looking issue, which is the major issue today. Because it doesn't allow you to be great easily to another provider. So you're stuck with the bunder and the other side we have the decentralized solutions more affordable more privacy rel compliant and low cost. But think, that fon for virus. They're using the blockchain technology and they're using a lot of protocols and decentralized consensus, which makes the system more slower. And so at the same times very difficult for developers to know the tax and or to build efficiently with this solution. So yeah for a company very quickly at the beginning of the journey you can spend hundred hours even more spend a lot of money to deploy with one or two or three different providers to build your own infrastructure it can be up to 25% of your revenue you're going to

[06:00] inject in fact to develop this at the same time DP technologies very interesting technologies. But it's only 0.1% of the market size. So I would say, that it's still a niche, that can be explored by people. But people do not have the time to explore them. So it is why we have decide to build flashback. So with flashback you can do a cloud divers it's cloud diversification platform. So in fact you're going to have three different advantages. The first one you will be able to reduce your cost. Because by deploying on flashback what you can do is indeed play with centralized providers quite expensive. But sometimes play with decentralized providers you can have this easy access to deep technologies. We want to make it very easy like you connect you deploy your bucket. with this providers, which are some specific services on the top to deploy buckets. And. Then of course we want to make the

[07:00] mutual deployment seamless not only for large companies. But at some time for startups for five coders anyone, that want to indeed start at the beginning of the development of of their technology to have a multi cloud approach. And so to not to get right the bundle looking issue. Issue. I think it's mainly for the main presentation. But what I can do is perhaps. If it's okay to make like a little live demo of the platform. Sure, let's do, that. Okay, let's go. deos is always fun. Live demo is always fun, you know. Yeah, it's let's let's see what's u Okay, I can share the screen and just get used to the system. just to be sure, that I will share my work. Can I share my work screen? Okay, let's go like this. It would be easier. Because we're going to jump between my spider and

[08:00] Okay, great. So, So, this is the platform. Very simple. So with the platform of course you can read about the platform. So it's platform.flashback.tech tech and of course you can learn more you have a documentation I just open here the documentation you can go through the documentation documentation a lot of information about indeed what we are building why we're building this you have introduction storage want to make it as transparent as as informative as possible for people and of course you have some guides to help you to create your buckets repository configure with the system uploaded on the files. So today we are focusing on the optic storage, which is the first layer. I will say, that any kind of cloud solution. But indeed in the future want to have

[09:00] more features according to what developers can bring us in term of feedback and information what they want to have in this platform. So feel free as well to to to give any kind of feedback. You have a lot of API references. If you are more in depth of indeed interacted with our flashback API. So we we are trying to make it this as flexible as as possible for developers and indeed being able to to to play with the platform in the best way. So let let me of course you can sign up with your Google or GitHub account. You couldn't create otherwise you know email password it's okay and of course login. So in this case I'm going to log with my Google account just a few time and here

[10:00] of course you have the platform. So the the platform platform made we try to make things very simple to understand what's going on at the same time on the microord level. So the idea is to abstract the fact, that you're going to work with different code providers or to provide you all the information to understand how you can interact with different code providers. So you have an overview page where indeed you can have some links to the documentation you need and to start your journey with the platform. Some statistics transfer packet activity. So the packet activity is part of the cloud storage where we have the repository and buckets. So let's see the buckets. So I won't go deep in term of what is a bucket I think people who already are using no AWS or GCP or some S3 compatible solution can

[11:00] indeed understand what is a bucket. So here in fact it's with we are starting kind of flashback buckets to connect your buckets from AWS or GCP to the flashback system. So very briefly I want to go far. But for instance. If you are using AWS you can have different buckets. So here you have like three or four different buckets and indeed you can indeed find this bucket here. So two connects. Connects. Let's see. If we can just cancel this one for instance. Deleted sure. If it's going to work. Ah okay. Thank you. So to connect a bucket you have different ways to connect your bucket. You can connect your bucket with GCP AWS Azure. So Azure is bit different. So every provider has its own concept of all you can store you can do object

[12:00] storage with the cloud. So today we tested these five providers. You can find FCON. So we're using in fact through FCON we're using AAV, which is an S3 compatible provider on the top of Finch system is S3 compatible. But feel free as well. If you subscribe to the platform and want to try it to test the the other S3 compatible providers. Yeah, you can try I know there is some pinata stuff like this. So feel free to get your API key stuff like this and to set up your system. But for instance. If you're using. And then IWS. So let's see, I'm going to give a label for my my bucket and see look. I'm going to create a new bucket on my account. This way I can show you, that can work. So let's create a bucket on my AWS account. Oh, come on. You prepare

[13:00] everything to be log and you're log out. Huh? So, let's see. If we can go fast. Sign inh. No way. See later. Just want to skip for now. Now. Of course, always set up a lot of security there. But yeah, let's create a bucket. Okay. So, we're in the we're going to create a bucket, that say like the thieves thieves AWS buckets and PH blah blah blah We're just. So you can go through these different stuff depending on you're working with its. But of course for us and for the purpose of the demonstration we're just going to create the bucket directly. Here we are. And. So this field bucket I can just keep

[14:00] the name here. So it's good to there is some information to provide of course in the platform to be able to set up your buckets. But you need let's say, that it's my VSS buckets buckets fivebs fivebs here some stuff. So yeah. If I show you my secret and access key the I'm not sure I'm sharing my work screen, right? So, yeah, I can pause it for a moment. If you want. Oh, yeah. Just. If I can just this way. Yeah, in this way I can just perfect. Thank you, custom. Thank you for my privacy. So, let me find my keys and information like this. So there is a delegation system as well where you can delegate instead of indeed

[15:00] setting up the API keys and the secrets where we have to store it and to split it in different servers. You can use a delegation system, which allow you in fact to not share with us this kind of secrets or to keep a kind of a better security for you and your privacy. Okay, just a minute. Just this one. Okay, I'm just going to copy paste. Just one second. Of course, my computer is slow. Okay. And this one. Here we are. Okay, you can share again my screen. I think you're custom. So you see my screen normally. Yeah.

[16:00] Okay. We. So we said key secret key in this way. I can create my packets and too many requests. What did what did I do? Do? Okay. No worries. It's part of the test. Instant navigation. So what we're going to do is, that we are we're assuming, that you create your account. You can do, that with GCP as well. So same for GCP you have all the information to provide and according to what you you want to provide it's I have a sound from my side Kirsten I don't know. If you have the same you have one okay no I have a strange sound in my ear anyway. So depending on the different information you have to provide. So Google cloud storage is different information. So of course the best is to refer to create the bucket for instance to get the information or

[17:00] or to create the bucket. So there some information to provide to connect your bucket with with a solution. So once you indeed provide your bucket. So it's create your bucket you have this status in fact we're using a technology, which called the bridge node. You can as well find some information in in the documentation. So we explain what is the bridge node and indeed the purpose of the bridge node. So we have some region we're covering. So the bridge node is mainly in fact a system, that allow us to interact with the different providers. It's our AP technology and it's where in fact we can get and collect different metrics of your different buckets. And. So of course once you create your buckets you can create what we call a repo. So we have we we have created I created this morning in different buckets and of course you have this repo. So. When you want once you want to

[18:00] create a repo you can call it any names you want like repo 6 five like this you can add one or two packets different. Because let's GCP one create okay okay I should disconnect in fact I think. So anyway. So I continue say, that you just yeah yeah it's anation. But it's okay it's part the yeah it just went live. This this this this just went live and you already told me, that anyone who use it you would appreciate feedback. Because it is in the very early stage of being live. So. If if any of you try it out I know feedback is very appreciated. Appreciated. So these things happen. Exactly. We have a button to give a lot of feedback. So feel free to give any kind of feedback. Indeed it we we started to develop this in fact

[19:00] just straight after the the. So all this concept since February. And then we want to add this Stellar concept of the pin we have. But we can come come back on it later. And so in fact. When we once you have a repo in fact and the repo allow you to indeed have your different buckets. So you have the GCP AWS buckets and you can create to API keys. So here I create an API keys, which allow me in fact I will try to make it a very simple demo. If it's working to test any storage. But indeed for instance. If I want to store. So I have a repo I provide some access key secret key. So of course I did it in in JS and stuff like this and of course. If we can make this little example we are going to transfer this genus bill. I

[20:00] took the the text of the genus bill, and now we're going to create the genus bill and copy eight. So let's go. Here we are. So right. Now we're storing with an S3 endpoint to S3 buckets. So we can see, that we store something. We can always check, that is working. But. If we're looking the second AWS buckets, we should probably see this. We have a lot of test P8, which is here. But of course what is very funny is to see. If in our you know Google buckets from an S S3 endpoint we can get something there. So we're going to copy paste in term of bucket name, which is great. Because GCS and AWS is using some same wording. So let me go on the platform. You can find in fact duplicate

[21:00] names directly on the report details. So. So this one is the GCP one. I'm going to copy paste and and here we are. Good. Cut and we're going to send this same copy to the GCP. So we have an S3 end points and we're sending to DCP. Okay, thanks to in fact this bridge node, which is this address. Okay. So we can check it is do don't log out please. Okay. And here we are. So of course alpha vision right. Now I just show you with an S3 endpoints to store with

[22:00] GCS and AWS. You can try with Azure through the the tutorials. You can indeed provide some feedback. If it's working or not. It's a truly alpha vision. We're going to do a more stable vision in September with indeed more better UI and some improvements such as the private bridge nodes. Because today the bridge nodes are hosted by Flashback. But the idea indeed is to to to let you to be able to deploy this node in your tenants. And. So to manage your your strateging my screen should work like this. Okay, perfect. So it's globally all about the presentation about this little live demo with all the bugs we got. But

[23:00] yeah, of course it's still an alpha vision, an improved beta vision for for for flashback and our road map is very simple. We want indeed stabilize all of this. It's always a complex features. If it was simple you will have this everywhere. So we decided to take this challenge and and thanks to Stellar, we we have this chance to indeed push it with Stellar. We have this in the Stellar community fund for the one who are interesting. There is in fact a second product and feature called the flashback DP where in fact we as you can see in fact with this platform you interact with the platform with the service level of cloud providers. So of course it's still still the services but. If you want to interact with I would say data centers or in a higher privacy model you the the flashback DP will allow you in fact to interact

[24:00] with the data center is going to ask is hardware a software connect is bridge nodes. And then connect to the DBN marketplace. And so the Stellar is going to play a big key role there. Because we're going to deploy all smart contract with Stellar to indeed manage as marketplace as the same times to collect thanks to our bridge nodes to our smart contracts all the quality of services agreements and all the metric related to, that. So in the marketplace what you're going to find as a consumer you're going to connect to the flashback DPIN platform. You're going to find different offers from different providers. You're going to select the ones you want. Then these ones are going to give you thanks to the bridge note, which is S3 compatible and stuff like this. We believe, that they're going to use you know like system like Mio. So they are going to give you an API keys and stuff like this. So you can

[25:00] already interact with in in S3 in a very easy way and of course. Then once you decide and you have the right agreement with the storage providers we deploy all of this in the smart contract. And then we operate and the bridge is going to say okay this is the quality of services of the storage with the consumer speed I mean upload download speed latency stuff like this and according to the quality they agreed to increase the reputation score of contract on earth as a providers as well. And then it's where you start to have a bit of tokconomics and stuff like this. So it's what we we want to achieve with Stellar and normally we should have the first trench one delivered within the next weeks. So it's our next goal right now. That's super exciting and and I think it's it's really interesting. It's an interesting use case for for for smart contracts. just before we went on

[26:00] the call here, we were talking about there's a lot of focus on on DeFi applications on on chain and and more like working with tokenization and real world assets and. But but this is a very to me is a very untra untraditional blockchain project. But. But you have taken some of the elements and applied, that in in a project, that or a product, that you don't usually associate with with blockchain and I think, that's super interesting. Love to see more of, that. It's it's interesting to see these kind of use cases where you are thinking huh, that that was not obvious to use blockchain in, that way. But it works really well. So it broadens the the the scope of what you can do and how you perceive blockchain. So yeah, super interesting. Interesting. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Indeed, it's I would say, that for the the ecosystem. If people are very curious about this kind of technology, it's the deep technology finally. So

[27:00] the central physical infrastructure network some people are indeed deploying their own blockchain and their own protocol stuff like this. For us, we prefer to use the existing existing blockchain and to build in fact with smart contract. Which is great with Stellar is in fact the flexibility. I mean we first in Rust, which we have a preference in rest. Sorry Goland. But yeah we have a preference in Rust. The Stellar kit kit is very nice and and the thing is, that with all the programs you're doing like with the university is great. Because indeed you can discover the ecosystem and to you can truly develop something real. Great. Yeah. I don't know. If there's any questions from anyone watching. But otherwise I say this was this is super great to see this demo. I remember talking to you about this about a year ago and I

[28:00] thought this is an interesting use case. I would love to see, that in real life and here we are. You launched the the first version and yeah I I've been playing around with it and I think this is super interesting and everyone who plays around with it. If there's any. If you find anything u I think I know, that that you're very u you're very appreciative of of feedback. It is the it is early days of the platform. So yeah, please forward any feedback you may have. I think we have a question here from from Matias. It also raises awareness from other nonblockchain orient corpse and orgs to start thinking of integrations to make things more efficient. Yeah, I think this is a good example of, that. Exactly. Exactly. And I think we blockchain is AI cloud storage it's very demanding in term of I think, that that's put for the blockchain. So it's why it's maybe comparative is not. So developed

[29:00] because there are still a lot of things to do around blockchain in term of scalability to make this kind of use case more and more applicable with the blockchain. Yeah, we see a lot of focus on on AI not just on tooling. But also like implementing both blockchain and AI in the same application where it makes sense how are you using AI. I know. If I see on your website you do mention AI. So in what way are you using AI in your application? Application? Yeah. So it's true, that. If people go through our website we don't do not mention. So much about decentralized technologies and stuff like this. And indeed. Because it's like for us a kind of motor and people you know see the design of the car and not specifically the motor inside. But in our AI we are going to I mean from the AI we're going to develop we have different steps of the we're going to have the first step is could be a chatbased recommendation system. Because basically most of the

[30:00] developers v coders even exper people with expertise sometimes needs do as well to to see how they can leverage in the best way the platform. So we're going to guide people. So chart to understand what they are looking for in term of multi cloud configuration. If they're looking for a micro configuration. If they have some credits or we can help them to reduce the cost and sometimes to take all the benefits of this wide ecosystem, which is extremely fragmented today. And. So it's going to be the first version of AI and indeed with the use AI needs data. And so AI can't do a lot. If you don't have a lot of people using the platform. So it's why I'm pushing people to indeed try and use the platform. Because this AI is going to indeed learn more about your patterns and more learn about all you you can do with the

[31:00] platform. And then improve your recommendation in real time saying like oh yeah you are using this kind of storage, you're doing everything in odd storage with AWS. While in fact we can see, that 50% of your data are not used in a frequent way. So you are just being a lot perhaps you can just be great part in StarJ or FON and reduce the cost. And so it's where the AI is going to intervene in your journey with the platform and what we want to achieve with AI for decentralization. It's you know decentralizing AI is always complex is more perhaps what we are looking at right. Now is perhaps on the privacy level perhaps on providing all the is doing certain recommendation stuff like this. But right. Now the decentralized AI is still kind of a baby in in the crypto space. Yeah. I noticed something you said, that you're not really advertising. You don't really write, that you, that that you use blockchain.

[32:00] and I think, that's actually it it's it's interesting. Because I see blockchain as a technology just like many other technologies. It's not necessarily necessarily, that that the users don't really it's it's information, that if. If you have a really nice imple implementation, that doesn't really have where users don't have to jump through a lot of hoops, that we usually see in a lot of blockchain applications. It's not really relevant. How you choose to solve the the problems is is not you use technology. In this case you use blockchain. I love to see it be more normalized, that blockchain you don't need to put it up as a big banner you're using blockchain like more normalized using blockchain in different kinds of applications. So I think, that's, that's interesting yeah we have a question more from Matias he asked what you think about awe

[33:00] a good question aweave is extremely nice in term of volat of course it's made for this I mean it has been designed for this I know, that there is they're doing more and more kind of development on the top of the protocol there right. Now to indeed diversify with other other storage type like storage and or at least storage perhaps our wave is a bit expensive from my u point of view specifically. If you want to store NFTs. So you know very small portion of data the cost for a terabytes is very specific application at least for the main the core protocol of code I know, that they're working on different angle and trying to simplify or doing what the cloud is doing finally. So I think the next evolution they're going to do can be good I think it's

[34:00] they got the same issue, that Fon got in the past. Because Fon did this protocol very interesting consensus by the way. I mean it's very the math behind it is it's beautiful. I mean they did something very very nice zero knowledge applic too too slow and I don't know all people know about, that. But you have to. When you store your data with fon you have to unlock a portion of gigabytes you have to seal it. And then in seal it. So this mechanism, that prove, that you're somebody hosting your data at the same time it's very slow to retrieve the data. So they have to work on a lot of systems and you know to accept certain central centralized process to make it faster. But anyway it's it's part of the blockchain journey I believe, that more

[35:00] and more the blockchain is going to evolve the best it would be in term of u decentralization for storage and computing and more great well thank you so much for joining today for me It's it's it's been fun to be a tiny part of this journey. I've followed you along the lines since we on the side since we met first time last year and see, that you you launched the product and yeah, it's great to see. So everyone please go check it out and yeah, thank you again for for joining this week. Week. Thank you very much guys. Thank you everyone for for joining. We'll be back again next week.
