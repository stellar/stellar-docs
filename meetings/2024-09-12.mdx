The Dev Experience team presented recent Stellar CLI enhancements aimed at simplifying smart contract development and testing. The session focused on reducing friction when working with contract IDs and improving reproducibility in local test environments.

Through live demos, Nando showed how aliases can replace long contract IDs in day-to-day CLI usage, and how ledger snapshots enable developers to capture and reuse a specific ledger state when writing and running tests.

### Key Topics

- CLI contract ID aliases:
  - Installed the Hello World example to show aliases.
  - Showed examples of how contract IDs are often passed as CLI parameters, such as in `invoke` (copying the ID string or using command substitution).
  - Demonstrated how to deploy a smart contract and create an alias.
  - Demonstrated how to invoke a smart contract using the alias.
- Ledger snapshots:
  - Creating a snapshot of a specific ledger state
  - Using snapshots in test cases for deterministic behavior
  - Improving repeatability and reliability of local contract tests
- Documentation updates:
  - New command-line examples tailored for Windows users
  - Introduction of a CLI recipe book with common workflows
