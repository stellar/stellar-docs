Dev Experience team member Nando Vieira presented the CLI alias and snapshot features:

1. Alias
   1. Installed the Hello World example to show aliases.
   2. Showed examples of how contract IDs are often passed as CLI parameters, such as in `invoke` (copying the ID string or using command substitution).
   3. Demonstrated how to deploy a smart contract and create an alias.
   4. Demonstrated how to invoke a smart contract using the alias.
2. Snapshot
   1. How to create a ledger snapshot.
   2. How to use the snapshot in a test case.

Toward the end, Nando reviewed the developer documentation, focusing on newly added command-line examples for Windows users and a helpful CLI recipe book.
