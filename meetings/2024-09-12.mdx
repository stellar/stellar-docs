Developer Experience team member Nando Vieira introduced the CLI features alias and snapshot:

1. Alias
   1. Install of Hello World example for showcasing alias
   2. Showed examples of how contract IDs are often passed as parameters in CLI commands like invoke (copying ID string or command substitution)
   3. How to deploy a smart contract and create an alias
   4. How to invoke the smart contract with the alias
2. Snapshot
   1. How to create a ledger snapshop
   2. How to use the snapshot in a test case

Towards the end Nando went through the developer documentation, with focus on the added command line examples for Windows users, and a useful cookbook for CLI commands.
