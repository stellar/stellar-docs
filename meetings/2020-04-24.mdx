Kolten led this Engineering Talks session with a focus on usability rather than protocol mechanics, framing the discussion around how developers can make Stellar applications approachable for people who are new to blockchain. He described the main obstacles users face—key management, on/off ramps, trustlines, anchors, and the DEX—and argued that most of this “hard stuff” should be abstracted away so users can focus on clear, understandable actions.

The talk emphasized that Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) are the primary tool for achieving this abstraction. By treating SEPs as an application-layer standard rather than core protocol changes, teams can build interoperable products that evolve over time while delivering simpler user experiences. Colton illustrated how narrowing scope, simplifying interfaces, and educating users up front can dramatically improve adoption without sacrificing the power of the network.

### Key Topics

- Why usability is a major barrier to adoption, especially for developers and users who are new to blockchain.
- Treating SEPs as the glue between apps and the network, enabling interoperability without exposing protocol complexity.
- Federation (SEP-5) and mnemonic phrases as ways to reduce user anxiety around public and private keys.
- Account recovery via SEP-30 as a critical usability improvement for lost keys without handing control to third parties.
- Anchor standards (SEP-6, SEP-24, SEP-26) that let users move between the real world and Stellar without leaving their wallet.
- The progression from raw tools (Stellar Laboratory) to wallets, and finally to single-purpose apps with focused use cases.
- Examples of simplifying experiences through vertical apps like SatoshiPay, DStoq, and Vega.
- The importance of onboarding and education: showing value before sign-up, clear messaging, and localized translations.
- Encouraging developers to both follow existing standards and participate in creating new ones as the ecosystem evolves.

[01:00] Okay, I think we're live. What's up everybody? Welcome to this week's edition of Stellar engineering talks. My name is Colton, I'm the community manager here at the Stellar Development Foundation and I am NOT an engineer, but I will pretend to be one for the next 30 minutes or so for the sake of conversation. This week, I'll be talking about creating usable Stellar applications and I also wanted to give a reminder that this is a series that we're planning to do on a bi weekly basis, so every other week we'll have an engineer from SCF come on and talk about whatever they're working on, sort of internally at the foundation. So before we get started, I want to give a little background on this talk and why we thought it might be a good idea to host it. So lately within the ecosystem team, we've been thinking a lot about how we want to onboard developers into the ecosystem, whether that's, you know, developers who aren't native to the blockchain space. We're developers who are just thinking about creating financial applications or whatever, and a lot of them, whenever they first start

[02:00] Working with Stellar, they don't completely understand some of the usability implications or they don't understand some of the technical aspects. So creating a resource like this as a sort of way for them to have something to reference and look back on to understand what they should be considering with building Stellar applications is sort of the basis for this talk. So let's see if I can change slides here. Yes, so basically, also before we get started, I wanted to spend some time defining usable. I understand that usable means many different things to many different people. Right, we have all these different applications within the Stellar ecosystem. They all serve different user bases, they all have different use cases and so usability kind of means a couple of different things across different services. So rather than think of this as like a set in stone definition for what usability means, I'm more of just trying to create a baseline for understanding what sort of makes applications usable or how to give your application a better chance of being usable within this Stellar

[03:00] Ecosystem. So we also need to understand why Stellar can be hard to use, especially for people who aren't super into the space, right up there, encountering your applique for the first time. What are the some of the things that they can have trouble with? And some of these things include going from the real world to the blockchain, right, we all remember that first time, like how do I get my hands on this coin? Or how do I use a stable coin? Also, things like public and private keys are extremely difficult. They're not really something you're used to in your daily life. And there's constant. There's this concept of decentralization, right? What does that even mean? Where is your app on the spectrum, etc. There's things like security. So, for the first time, a lot of users are responsible for their own security: maintaining their own private keys, making sure they send their funds to the right place, etc. And then you have things that are Stellar specific, like the seller, decentralized exchange, anchors, trust lines, lumens, and so you can take all this stuff and bundle it up and just

[04:00] Call it hard stuff, right? So how do we create applications that abstract away all this hard stuff and make use cases? I'm easy to understand and easy to use for, you know, the average person who's not into the black gene space. So I mentioned all these hard things. What can we do about it? The first thing is create and use standards. So within the Stellar ecosystem, we have what are called Stellar Ecosystem Proposal, or steps, and essentially these steps provide a set of standards for developers to implement when building Stellar applications. And these are things that evolve over time with the needs of the ecosystem. These are things that evolve. It's new use cases pop up and these are things that also evolve as technology improves. So steps are not this thing that's like set in stone on the protocol level- disease. They're these things that are constantly improving for developers to use. And the way I like to think about steps are just this category of sort of protocols that exist on top of the network. So oftentimes- and we're describing Stellar and some of its functionality- a lot of

[05:00] People confuse that for functionality of the network. But really it's just a standard that we choose to follow to make that functionality possible. So think about steps is this thing that exists on top of the network, in between applications and Stellar itself. So it is possible for applications to just directly interact with the network without you know implementing any of the steps. But the problem lies and that you might be able to use the network but you might not be able to interoperate with other applications in the space, right like you might not be able to send a federated addresses, you might not be able to work with anchors, etc. So it's really important that if you're building an application in the space that you know mind the standards, try to follow the standards, pay attention to the standards and try to implement them whenever you're thinking about ways to build your application and serve users in the best way possible. Oh, I went too far. So some examples of what you can sort of do with SEPs or what problem steps can solve, are

[06:00] Things like set to the Federation protocol, so you have a standard where, basically, we can map human readable addresses to Stellar addresses. I know a lot of you probably remember the first time you sent any significant sum of money from. You know whether it's your exchange account or your wallet, and you're typing in a public key manually and you are super scared that you might have forgot. You know your fur. You might have forgot one character or one letter or whatever and if you mess up you lose all your money. So what better a federated addresses do is turn these public keys and to human, readable addresses, like on key base where you have colton star key base do or whatever. This is super easy to send to a friend, super easy to read if you're a user. And basically it just takes the stress away from you know dealing with public keys. So whenever you're building applications, thinking about, okay, how can I make the stress of public and private keys easier to handle for my users, and federated there are the Federation protocol. It's

[07:00] One way to do that. Another way is do something called SEP 5, which is a way of just defining how we should derive key pairs. And so one of the things that key SEP 5 lays out is this way to represent secret seas or private Keys as mnemonic phrases. So mnemonic phrases are basically like just a list of 24- 12 to 24 words. I believe that basically represent a private key. So if you're moving from one application to another, you don't have to copy and paste or write down this super long and secret key that you might mess up, but rather you can just write down human readable words and the kind of go behind. This is just: I have something that users can resonate with. Right, like it's hard to write down the super long string of characters, hope you don't forget a number and then you're screwed forever. So you want to come up with a way to make words easy to write down and easy to digest, so that if I mess up like, let's say, I misspelled deposit and I'm trying to move my secret key to some

[08:00] Application to another application. I can figure out that- a misspelled deposit- but I can't figure out that I forgot a character in my secret key. That's much harder. So the other thing to mention is, like, this is something that's constantly evolving, right, and this is like the benefit of doing things through SEPs rather than trying to change them at the core protocol level. So there's also a step in the works called SEP 30, which is basically multi party key management of Stellar accounts. So this is a protocol that basically defines a way for an individual to regain access of a Stellar account if they lose their private key. So in the event that you lose your private key, which is a huge usability problem, not only in the seller ecosystem but in the blockchain ecosystem as a whole, you can find a way to recover that key without giving control of the key to a third party, right? Because if controlled, if a third party has controlled the key, then that means they can steal your money if they wanted to. Hopefully they don't, but it's

[09:00] Possible. So coming up with different ways to make you know private keys and public keys easier to manage for users is an extremely important thing to think about when you're building your Stellar applications. Then next, we have standards for anchors and clients to interoperate with each other. Right, this problem of going from the real world to Stellar, or to any other blockchain for that matter. Right now the current flow is like you go to a coin base or you go to buy Nance, go to a coin base, or you go to buy Nance or whatever. You create an account, you have to buy some coin and then you send that coin over to your wallet and then you can maybe transfer it to a different coin and then send it to your friends, and then you have to go back to coin base and then try to get it out. So there's this like super convoluted process of going across different applications just to achieve a goal, and so we've created standards here in the Stellar ecosystem that try to solve that problem, such as: I accept six at point four, SEP 26, and so basically, this allows you to go from the real world to your Stellar wallet without ever needing to

[10:00] Actually leave your Stellar wallet. An example of this is in practice. You can see. I think all Lobstr, our wallets, StellerX, etc. All of you support it. But an example on Lobstr here is that I want to deposit USD for Maker USD into my account, I just click deposit, I fill out some information, I click continue and boom. Anchor USDA interface loads up within my wallet. I never have to leave. And so the benefit of this is that you can all of a sudden Interop- interoperate with many sort of anchor services or on off ramp services inside of your application without ever needing to force your users to leave, and so basically, we can make all of our services on Stellar interoperate with multiple services, rather than like having to form a partnership with just wire right, you can choose a whole bunch of acres that you want to work with within your payment service outside of

[11:00] Standards. We can also sort of simplify the experience, we can make stuff that's easy to use. Some of you who might have been in the space for a long time- might know back in the day, maybe the only way to sort of send or receive stuff like Bitcoin is through the command line. And, of course, like no, I don't think payment applications are going viral through the command line any time soon. So we have to make these things easy to use, right, and so, first steps to do stuff like that or what tools like Stellar laboratory? Right, you create a wrapper around the entirety of the functionality of the network and, well to, Stellar laboratory is a super useful tool. It's not something that you would consider like for mainstream views, right, it's not something that you want to give to users and be like all right, cool, now you can send payments or make trades or whatever. So, while this is a step in simplifying the interface, it's not quite there yet, right, so we have to go a step further, and that's where things like crypto while it's come in. So they take the complexity of the network and

[12:00] They put it in a to easier to understand. Wrapper then say, like something like several laboratory, but even still, crypto Wallace can be pretty daunting, right, the use case is not immediately obvious for those who don't appreciate the complexity of the network or completely understand what they're trying to get out of it. So, by presenting all of this information users, it can help a little bit, but it might still be complicated for some. And so what can we do about that right like? It seems like we're out of solutions here, but we're not. We can actually continue to simplify until we simplify it use cases. So, if you think about where we started, we simplified the interface for interacting with the network and then we simplified use cases for interacting with the network. And an example of this is something like Satoshi Bay. Right, the only aspect of seller you're really exposed to when using Satoshi pays micro payment service is sending transactions on the network and then receiving transactions on the network. They don't expose you to a bunch of different

[13:00] Functionality. It's literally as simple as deposits and lumens haze pay for some content, nothing crazy. Additionally, we see this explored through things like D stock, where, instead of focusing on the payments aspect of Stellar, they focus on the decentralized exchange aspect of Stellar. So now you can decide: ok, I need to buy and sell stocks. I just need to know the price and I just need to say how much I want to buy and sell and boom, I can do it right there in the interface. So I take away all of the complexity of deciding what I want to do by just presenting one single use case within the app. And another example of this is Vega. So Vagos, the dollar savings app that we're working on internally here at SEF, and essentially it just lets you send and receive different local currencies, as well as exchange in and out of those local currencies, but you're not exposed to a bunch of order bucks, you're not exposed to a ton of public and private keys. A lot of the stuff is abstracted away so that your overall experience using the application is

[14:00] Super easy to understand, and so, again, we want to expose users to as little as possible about the network. Hone in on one thing that you want your application to do really well and just focus on that. It's not really necessary to support all of the functionality on Stellar, because it can be a lot to handle. as a developer. It's also a lot to handle as a user, and then the a lot to handle as a user, and then the next thing we can do is educate users. So you want to let users know what they're getting up front. One of the things that I find a lot of services guilty of, especially in this space, is that people will understand the value proposition right away. That's oftentimes not the case, and so you want to make sure that you can present that value proposition to them. Some examples of this in the real world are, say, like key bases homepage. So key base is an extremely powerful chat application but it's it can be difficult to use if you don't know what those value propositions are,

[15:00] And so you have their home page where it. kind of goes through all of the functionality that's available to you and why you might want to use that stuff. And then another example on the right is something like robin hood. And what's interesting about this example is like, if you're downloading robin hood, you probably know what you're getting before you download it, and so essentially, I know what I was gonna get before I create an account. But they still take the time to educate me anyway. So, for example, they do these four slides where they talk about: you know you can invest in socks, it's secured, you have free stock trading, etc. They let you know what you're getting before you even click signup or before you even click login. So recreating this flow within your Stellar applications is just as important, right? Not everybody understands Stellar's value proposition. of interoperability and so making sure that they understand those up front, always good to do. An example of this in the Stellar ecosystem- and I

[16:00] Think is one of the better examples, is Lobstr. So before you create a Lobstr wallet, they actually present you with these four screens, very similar to robin hood, where they tell you exactly what you're gonna get up front. Right trading platform. I can manage my assets- sick. That's exactly what I want to do. So when I create my account, I know exactly the functionality that I'm looking for and I know exactly how I'm going to use the app before I even get started. And then, additionally, they've spent some extra time to translate their app into other currency or other languages. Rather, so, if you're creating an application that's global in nature, which is absolutely possible on Stellar- you want to make sure that your service can actually onboard those users. Right, you want to make sure that it's translated for the target markets you're going after. You want to make sure that everybody can interact with your app- that you say should be able to interact with your app. Unfortunately, our community is sort of global in nature, and so it makes that process of finding people to do these translations really

[17:00] Easy. Right, you can pay a handful of community members to come knock out translations and next thing you know, you can serve markets all around the world and easily onboard those users without any confusion. So, to wrap this thing up and keep it kind of short and sweet- the three things we went over is sort of following standards, following and creating standards. This is really important. It's really important that if you're a developer and you're creating a use case and there's some standard that you think can be derived from it, that you participate in conversation and that you do your best to try to come up with standards for doing things, and then it's also important that you do your best to follow these standards. They're there for a reason: they'll make your life easier as not only a developer, but it'll make your life easier as somebody trying to launch a product that's interoperable with other products within the seller ecosystem. And you can find these in the Stellar GitHub repo. They're all there. There's about 30 ish of them or something like that. So if you're building an app on Stellar, make sure

[18:00] You're going through those, understanding them, understanding which ones makes sense for your use case and all that good stuff. Additionally, we want to simplify the experience, like I mentioned. So simplify interfaces right. Remove the stuff that's not necessary, abstract away the stuff that's really hard and then hone in on a use case. Find out what's you know. What are you actually trying to accomplish with your application? Is it a payments application? Maybe a little bit of both? What features do you need to present to your users and what features do you need to remove? And then, lastly, educate users right. Show them where the value is, show them what they're getting up front and make their lives easier whenever they're using your applications. You don't want to just dump an application with a ton of functionality on them that they'll never understand how to use. And that's it. So that's pretty much all I had to touch on throughout this whole presentation. I just wanted to go over some basics of

[19:00] What to consider when you're getting started on Stellar, and how you can sort of scour the ecosystem to find resources that can make your applications usable. I don't think there were any questions. If there are any, feel free to ask them really quickly and we can, I can try to answer them. But other than that, if you have any further stuff, you can't get ahold of me on key base. My username is just Colton. Additionally, you can find me on medium. I write a weekly newsletter called the dev digest, or basically I cover all of this kind of stuff. So if you're interested in the latest conversations around ecosystem standards, I cover that. If you're like, if you're curious about the latest developments in the ecosystem, I cover all that stuff. So if you're interested as a developer and keeping up with the stuff that's going on within this, our ecosystem, you can easily do that just by checking out my medium. And then there's also some base. There's basic stuff such as like introductions to trust lines, introductions to path payments, all that good stuff.

[20:00] So if there's no questions, I guess we can call it a little early. Thanks everybody for tuning in and remember to tune in. I think next week we're doing a set browned table and then the week after that we'll be doing another engineering talk. So thanks everybody for coming by.
