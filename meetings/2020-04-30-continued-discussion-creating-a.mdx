- my name is Lisa Nestor and I work on our ecosystem strategy team at the stellar Development Foundation and I will be providing moderation support during our discussions today so the the topic on the table for this virtual round table is a direct send proposal this is a discussion continued from exactly two weeks ago on April 16th and we will be talking through and finalizing the the direct send proposal first however I'd love to give just a little bit of background on what a SEP is this is a stellar native term and so SEP stands for stellar ecosystem proposal so steps are publicly created open source documents that live in a github repository and they facilitate the creation and eventual adoption of technical standards within the stellar ecosystem so steps are really a dynamic way of introducing standards and protocols utilized in the ecosystem built on top of the stellar network and in particular as new use cases evolve throughout the stellar ecosystem new steps help to formalize those use cases and make them increasingly easy to implement and streamline between various participants so specifically today we're going to be talking about the direct send sep people are also referring this referring to this as a send receive set and the purpose of this set is really to enable Fiat de Fiat payments that would be facilitated between two anchors we also think of this as being a set to support more traditional style cross-border payments in which a sender execute the transaction to receiver and a foreign destination and really wants that receiver to just have funds arrive in their bank account they don't really want to interact with a wallet or a digital asset themselves so like a remittance or a business payment the transaction is executed and the receiver can just the funds to date there have been some initial decisions made around this up and we've linked to the the specific github pull requests there and so to move forward let me quickly introduce our participants today we have four different companies from the stellar ecosystem representatives from each of these companies that will be joining us so we have Anthony from tempo we have Andy from Satoshi pay blue bemy from Kaori claudio from inclusive and Michael from SDF so thank you all so much for joining us and being patient this morning and so finally this is what today's agenda will be we are going to work hard to talk through each of these line items so if you're in the stream feel free to kind of follow along with us and with that I will hand it over to Michael from SDF to help kick things off thanks thanks Lisa okay so really quickly can't go back to the agenda yes so last week we talked a lot about the happy path for this proposal I think we got it to a really good place we had some updates from from the conversation and I think that we're pretty happy with where it is for the happy path where it's simply two anchors that have you know good financial partnerships or our financial institutions themselves and then what we're going to talk about today are some additions that might be become a part of the set or might become a part of an additional set then make it possible for a lot more parties to participate in this this network of Fiat to Fiat rails so the the first thing I'm talking about is a well is a multilateral kyc then if inclusive is going to give us a an update about what that is and I think the general idea here is it makes a much easier way for multiple parties to share kyc data so everybody doesn't have to duplicate efforts and people who might not be able to get involved previously can through this through this process and then we're going to talk about how non-custodial applications so noncustodial wallets can start to execute these directs and transactions so I'm going to pass it over to clutter you apologize if I pronounced that incorrectly no that's fine that's fine thank you you're closer than this at them from us - so what we are doing at the Cruces and what we are trying to achieve with multilateral kyc and what's let's say our role in the interstellar network so maybe you want to see if they're focusing on compliance checks KY c KY b and c DD continuous due diligence monitoring and reporting but multiple k was motivated kyc as a little bit of background and maybe already touched in the last discussion like each anchor for each payment right has to do a kyc on the sender the said if we are talking from bank or anchor set which is on the agenda and also the receiving anchor from the regulatory point of view also needs to put a YC on the on the sender right and the center and cross on the on the receiver so can we see multilateral also how we are calling its EDD connect basically we will enable through our guess product which is also late guy based to share this information in medicine formation are referring to the KYC data without any personal information attached to it right so as an example for example let's say one anchor from Europe wants to do payment to an anchor from Nigeria for example right and the anchor from Europe already onboard it let's say the sender using our chests api's and then also Canada from diner from Nigeria he's using our our cassock that's right so when the anchor from Nigeria will do the center kyc basically we are not performing another KFC check basically we are just sharing the existing data and let's say report and history of the center which was already made for the anchor from Europe right so basically this is Casey Casey connect OCD connect right and what this brings it to the table it brings I think cost deductions right because it reduce costs it also makes the process more efficient right because but just by enabling sharing data also this process is almost instant like it doesn't involve the basic LSE check Nativity church doesn't involve too much manual interaction but of course it can be extended with checks which will involve some let's say offline processing in case of you know you want to do extra due diligence on a certain entity or individual also this is multilateral AIC is not let's say enforcing an anchor to just you know do kyc in a single way basically it just you just try to provide the framework but each anchor can have its own particularities for example to extend kyc its own services or whatever you know third-party tools they are using right what else so we already starting discussion I think our CEO is in contact with most of the bankers which are present right now in the call to to agree upon let's say requirements and use cases which all of us try to fulfill on the stellar Network so yeah and we are more than welcome everybody else wants to join this is huge initiative okay this exciting two reasons I think what this gives us at least a sorry about seasoning okay so this excites me for two reasons one is what you said you mention it as cost savings and I think it's more than that I think it enables you know the cost savings come from right now every anchor kind of has to be a specialist in the KYC of every region which is obviously a huge cost and also just it's not going to happen so this kind of says you know this one company's going to focus on kyc in different regions and now everybody else doesn't have to so that's a cost savings and it allows you know no no company is going to be able to have a team large enough to really work all over the world and the second thing that it does and correct me if I'm wrong here this is this kind of goes to the the last point in that subsection was it enables people who may not be able to do actual kyc people who are not financial institutions such as Satoshi bei this will allow them to kind of offload the KYC process on to conclusive so when they start a process they can get kyc done through a regulated institution like inclusive and all the other parties in this multilateral agreement can accept it and that will that will regulatorily allow a Satoshi paid to start creating these transactions so we you know there's two things blocking them one is the technical way does it fit into the second one is the regulatory way will other parties accept payments that originated from a noncustodial wallet so am I correct in saying that this this will solve those two problems yes you're right you're right we provide everything everything you said and that's room so basically that's that's our mission you know to provide easy access to to compliance services and also you know to banking integrations and then yes also from outside that sounds like that's what we're aiming for cool to hear from the anchors does that make sense from your perspective I'm just kind of given how you typically handle your responsibilities anchors to myself how much access we have two simple kyc processor and then as long as we have you know like access to the data and so on and so forth we could probably still meet the regulatory requirements saying that yes we did do this kyc we didn't have access to the KYC data and when you do your own processing like you just said this is only in your own home country right so you still don't need to specialize in kic for other countries just yourself yes perhaps to meet the referee requirement in Honduras diction reckon each of us in country specific and in this multilateral agreement is that something that's allowed we're a receiving acre can pull the data down or is it obfuscated behind a token to have the actual data to meet arranged to meet the regulatory requirement so it can't be obfuscated we have to have access to my data and insert the situation required to share that data with directly interests of for example if there's a little vest or something like that they would need to see the actual basis so bright we confiscated we means actually access it in the current situation where we process it ourselves moving we you know we would actually process and store my data so it wouldn't be a office cater to sighs my regulate so cardio is that something that's possible with your scheme yeah so basically just to make things a little bit clearer you like you know for example energy that you have the data you want to do the KYC check on it right so what you will do you will just call us and we will just see if those person were already kyc it right and we have a report on them and of course only if the institution like the anchors that you are participating in this one are billing to share the information about them right because each country might have its own degree place you know in a certain card any country maybe you are not allowed to share the KYC information even though if it's not a personal information right so basically each anchor will will own the personal information yes we will also have it but you will get back the the KYC data right so we will not get anything over skated on it right okay any data that shared from one anchor who's part of this multilateral agreement that data can then be pulled down by a receiving anchor who is also part of the agreements exactly it's a full data sharing agreement it's not like it's not like we're just saying what we trust that conclusive did it so we're we're cool with everything we can actually pull whatever we need down yeah yeah exactly cool okay that that sounds it sounds like it solves the problem from from Kyra's end I don't know if Anthony from tempos and does that sounds does that sound right to you does this sound like it'll solve any problems from your end it could there's EU regulation and it's going in place where they have to be authorized by the EU central bank as a kyc provider so that's something where if inclusive would have to get this authorization from the EU yep yep and they and it's right now I don't think they've actually approved anybody there's a bunch of companies in application process but that's the current state in EU and then we're also doing it in Japan and in Japan it's a little bit more lenient they don't require this sort of artificial intelligence on me on the passport and ID or ID and we typically consider the EU to be kind of one of them the more strict jurisdictions is that correct that's my understanding specifically Japan and Germany in Switzerland strictest okay and then France comes right after I would say okay cool and then I mean the nice thing about that is that's inclusive bread and butter is to get authorized by all these places so that everybody else doesn't have to so okay it sounds like to me that scheme does solve the the regulatory issues with satoshi pay another noncustodial waltz being able to you know get kose data into the system and to be trusted from that end Lisa can you share a link to that agenda could I could pull up I think the next thing that we talk about is the technical aspects of it so I guess we can look at some more these questions so the the strict we're asking if the strategy works for everybody it sounds like assuming that inclusive gets authorization from EU to provide this kind of data that this will actually solve a lot of these problems we asked about if there's any geographies or scenarios where this may break down and we kind of talked about how you know in Europe things are stricter but it doesn't it doesn't break down as long as as long as the providing company can can get authorized in that geography and then if we're looking at edge cases where this may not work I think one of the edge cases is the case where the receipt actually needs some more data so you know I'm imagining the situation where a sending client comes in in a very lenient state provides you know some data that might get them access to their their originating countries regulations but once you're trying to send the summer and EU the case it might be that they need more information there they're much stricter and so I'm curious how inclusive would imagine is working do we do we ask the receiving anchor to collect more data or does conclusive say okay well now that you're going to be you we're gonna have to collect more data do we have an idea how that work yes so we had a we had a talk and discussion internally about these and to be honest it depends it depends on the customer right because each customer has as its own needs but how we want to address it is like each customer will let's say like a compliance customer of ours can't define its own list of extra fields they want to collect right besides our core fields which we provide by default for doing my C's KY based on individuals and entities right and this this is how how we are ticket to bleed and of course if for example a field to make sense for us also to include it by default in the core fields we can do this and for example I think I can give an example as a result of the discussion we had with Kaori for example they they requested to have a custom field called the BGN a bank coordination number which is specific to Nigeria and to validate this field we have to integrate a specific API from from Nigeria to do that right and then we have an internal internal discussion and what we decided is this is that look this is a core field for philosophy because not only covering is with all the entities or any rituals from Nigeria and need this kind of validation if you want to offer them the the compliance check they need right in that specific country and region so that's one saying it depends on the case on the case right because if if something is can be made as a core field we will include it as a core field and it's enabled by all the countries so if a customer from a certain country or something region right if it's something specific let's say not to a country or region but to a company or entity or individual it can be addressed but to configuration so we we thought on this and at least these are these are the two directions we want we want to go if it makes sense so when the POC is originally being provided when an originating anchor initially collects the data are they collecting that data with the knowledge of where it's going to go so that they can say you know they can tell you hey we want to send this baby you what do we need to collect or do they just collect the data for their own region and send it to you and then wait around in the process the receiving anchor will then ask you for the data yeah okay so how I see this process is that I think to the steps which are available on the on the stellar protocol like each anchor will define its fields he needs for kyc care might be right so basically when this information is exchanged between anchors you know each anchor will not like for example maybe as an anchor which is using secrecy as compliance provider maybe will interact with an anchor which does music it doesn't use conclusive compliance right and this is and 50 to correct me if I'm wrong this is embedded in the intercepts right to the fields you you can share between anchors so each anchor should be responsible to to configure these fields even if it's a constant field for example and maybe it's not on the I think it's set 9 which has the list of the fields right it still can be requested to this exchanging of fields right and yeah of course if it's viable for you also can be also added on that list right okay so it sounds like it's it's the responsibility of the originating in here to make sure that they're giving you enough data so but exactly and of course some of the fields can be made off from some of the tea fields can be made required right so you can have this flexibility right to jump away the fields cool does anyone else in the edge cases where that scheme might fall apart Oh because it sounds okay but generally what we do because well for the first time you might not necessarily know all his intended jurisdictions Mike gave you my mother everywhere intends to send she going forth but what we tend to do is as we got a client we would say we would often which countries or which region I mean sending two intense eccentric now in the future kind of thing and based on that for example if you have payments that are going to Europe or to include Europe as one of their destinations then we would try and acquire the KYC to make the information required for Europe if it's the u.s.
- we were trying to quite finish so we take no responsibility as an acrobat engaged payments to get the correct information for correct destination and it's business-to-business payments and there's very involving onboarding process we can ask the client front that okay are you going to meet with the US Rep against the name of the European which and that means we can we have a better idea of what can when submission it would meet for the destination okay yeah I think that's all make sense there's also the case where for example for a very large transaction we might you know the recent anger might need extra data and I think this is fine the way that it would work is in the step right now the descending a Turk I checked the status the transaction periodically and it might find out about there is actually more data needed so in this case would they provide it directly to the anchor or would they provide it to inclusive and until the anchor we've updated they're kind of kyc profile with with extra data that you needed I actually don't think it matters I think both ways would work just fine I think from my perspective and at least how we are placed right now I think is the anchor responsibility because basically having seen these-- Cruces with his compliance service sit under the anchor is not exposed to the anchor right because all the all what you get exposed to the anchor is just the API definitions which are guided by the spiceps right so in any set right now there is no mention of inclusive no mention of a compliance engine right so basically the anchor is responsible to integrate with inclusive through a set right a set which collects the chaos information at least this isn't if I'm seeing things right now maybe in the future can is everybody else still here I'm still here yeah I think we got a just a little yes delay there okay I do have one or two comments or questions so I kind of on topic one of them is you know Michael we historically had a compliance a compliance service or compliance server as part of the stellar ecosystem stack did you all consider using that and why or why not yeah I think that step 3 I'm just gonna pull it up real quick there there were aspects of it that we used for sure and there were aspects of it that didn't quite work this is a good question and I think I should put some information about the I the answer is I would need to go back and kind of collect the answer to that I don't I don't have it offhand I do know that we referenced if you're talking about step 3 we referenced it in a lot of ways but there were a lot of hiccups to it that made it more difficult its Anthony I can I can I can add to that because we were using it quite a bit to compliance ever it's a lot the this new implementation is a lot simpler and cleaner and this the compliance server was a little bit compliment complicated to implement and it's a little bit different from these from the other except 24 so this will keep everything kind of in with one authentication mechanism SEP 10 and one kind of signing of the data gotcha that makes sense today great and so one other comment that all I'll bring in before we jump back into things you know we're talking a lot about sharing kyc data between anchors can anyone speak to how we ensure that this data is treated securely as part of this process I mean you know how how does a consumer using an anchor know that any personal information they share is going to be treated securely throughout this kind of anchor - anchor can we see exchange process so I think there's there's there's a few aspects of that to look at one is technically how is this actually secured and but I think the more interesting question is business-wise you know we are sharing data between entities so how do we ensure you know that your personal data doesn't get sent to some shady anchor that you know it steals it and does whatever with it so from the technical side I think you know everything's obviously encrypted I think this about this set makes it clear that this has to be all of our steps basically say you have to use HTTPS so everything is cryptid over the wire everything is authenticated using SEP 10 was a cryptographically secure way to say that only authenticated people can access this so people who are part of this network have all agreed on a public key with each other so that they can authenticate with each other so I think it's safe to say that for all reasonable intents and purposes this data can only be accessed by the parties who are involved in this agreement now the interesting part of the question is how do we know who's part of this Agreement how do we know who can actually access our data and I think the answer to that is you know anyone who's part of this multilateral agreement knows who else is part of this agreement so you are you know as a user you're giving your data to a company that you trust if if you're giving your data to a company you don't trust like all bets are off so you know you've kind of entered into this by saying I trust Howry to deal with my data and implicitly you're saying I also agree that the people that calorie shares this data with I also trust but we do get into kind of a more you know that that's a that's a much bigger leap does anyone else have any thoughts on kind of that the trust story here involved with personal data yes so from my point of view or our point of view I think it would make a lot of sense if the user would sign something like a piece of data that says I want to or I agree to share my data with anchor X so also anchor X can later odd ZK was he provided conclusive can later proof that the use of was was informed about that is that the data is going to be shared because I signed that piece of data so it's it's like in a contract between two parties yeah I think it's a much clearer story when you know a user comes to calorie puts in their data clearly they trust carry with the data and then they actually go to send the money and it says we're gonna go through tempo I don't know if the UI actually tells them what they're going through but pretty much this thing I want to put my data in for this this this transfer from you know between these two companies so I trust that these two companies will will treat my data properly the the question that comes up is since we have this multilateral agreement can a third company come in and just request you know request Michael Feldstein data from from conclusive you know if a kind of sketchy company gets so there's I guess there's two questions here that I have for the the conclusive product is does every party be that's already involved in the multilateral agreement have to agree to a new party entering and then second question can any party at any time just requests data that's been entered into this pool or is it only possible when a user agrees that you know they want that's the other party they want involved with their data mm-hmm so sorry for dropping off but they have some internet issues so so it depends to ask you a question because I think it depends on the under regulations for example in the u.s.

Lisa Nestor reconvened Tempo, Cowrie, SatoshiPay, Inclusive, and SDF to lock down the “direct send” SEP. She recapped how SEPs formalize cross-border use cases and framed this spec as the missing piece for fiat-to-fiat payments where the receiver simply wants money in a bank account.

Claudio from Inclusive then detailed a multilateral KYC service so anchors can share due-diligence data (even across strict EU/Japan regimes) without re-running every check. The roundtable closed with the technical plan for letting noncustodial wallets trigger these payments—SEP-10 whitelisting, tokenized memos, and how anchors can accept flows initiated by apps such as SatoshiPay.

Key discussion threads:

- Scope of the direct send SEP and how it extends SEP-6/24/10 to support anchor-to-anchor remittances where receivers never touch a wallet.
- Inclusive’s “EDD Connect” concept: sharing KYC/KYB results, handling consent and data privacy, and giving smaller anchors access to compliant onboarding.
- Requirements for noncustodial initiators: registering wallet keys, using SEP-10 auth, handling memos and transaction statuses, and preserving anchor control over compliance.
