## [Public Discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/NJl_loV_RXU/m/SarzWEJPAgAJ)

### Announcements

- **[Merging in CAP/SEP Process](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/247)**
  - Another round of edits completed; further feedback requested on the PR.
  - Intent to merge immediately, formalizing the previously ad-hoc CAP/SEP process.
  - All CAPs will be numbered upon acceptance as drafts; competing proposals will be explicitly rejected.
  - Post-merge cleanup planned for stale PRs and issues, with authors notified of next steps.
- **Establishing focus given limited developer resources**
  - Fee structure
  - Payment channels
  - Payment network (**Starlight**)

### Final Comment Period - Acceptance

- [CAP-0017](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0017.md) - Update `LastModifiedLedgerSeq` If and Only If LedgerEntry Is Modified (Jonathan Jove)
- [CAP-0018](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0018.md) - Fine-Grained Control of Authorization (Jonathan Jove)
- Address offer mutability (Jon)
- CAP-0016 to be rejected contingent on CAP-0018 approval

### Priorities

1. Replace Min Fee Mechanism
2. Trustline (& other) Usability
   - Explicit intent to revive [CAP-0013 Change Trustlines to Balances](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0013.md) (Dan Robinson).
3. Payment Channels
   - Focus on core components required for a basic payment channel design.
4. Starlight
   - Deferred pending availability of dedicated development resources.

### Deferred Items

- [CAP-0007](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0007.md) - Deterministic Account Creation (Jeremy Rubin)
- [CAP-0008](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0008.md) - Self-Identified Pre-Auth Transaction (Jeremy Rubin)
- [CAP-0009](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0009.md) - Linear / Exterior Immutable Accounts (Jeremy Rubin)
- [CAP-0011](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0011.md) - Relative Account Freeze (Jeremy Rubin)
- Draft: Deterministic accounts and creatorTxID (David Mazières)
- [CAP-0014](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0014.md) - Adversarial Transaction Set Ordering (Jeremy Rubin)

### Agenda

- Final Comment proposals - new unresolved concerns (30 min max)
- CAP-0017, CAP-0018
- Address offer mutability
- Replace Min Fee (60 min max)

### Replace Min Fee Discussion

- Diverging views:
  - David and Nico prefer a mechanism _before_ raising the min fee.
  - Jed favors pushing fee increases forward immediately.
- Current proposals:
  - [CAP-0010](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0010.md) - Fee Bump Account (Jeremy Rubin)
  - [CAP-0015](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0015.md) - Bump Fee Transactions (OrbitLens)
  - Pre-draft: feeSource and feeMultiplier (David Mazières)
- [Reference spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_u0LE61V-jkXUcNBZW5xhXZEmIz5rQSgZEr8VsVl47o/edit) (OrbitLens) compares fee-sponsorship approaches (CAP-10 fee balances, feeSource/feeMultiplier, deterministic accounts, CAP-15 metadata) across tradeoffs like explicit sponsor control, pre-signed tx support, and algorithmic complexity.
  - CAP-10 introduces dedicated fee balances so sponsors can preload fees, but it requires new operations and careful management of locked fee funds.
  - FeeSource/feeMultiplier and deterministic accounts keep fees on existing transactions but push complexity to signers (pick fee source in advance, ensure simultaneous submissions) with limited control.
  - CAP-15 embeds fee bumping in the transaction envelope, letting sponsors declare amounts per envelope, while the spreadsheet emphasizes choosing the right tradeoff between sponsor control and implementation simplicity.
- Outcomes:
  - David to draft a new CAP superseding CAP-0015, including Transaction versioning.
  - Johnny to follow up with David regarding feeSource draft status.

### Trustline Usability

- Discussion on next steps for CAP-0013 Change Trustlines to Balances
- Open questions:
  - What changes would improve group consensus?
  - Are there unpresented fundamental ideas?
  - Who should own the proposal going forward?
- Related discussion: **Sender Pays** (sending assets without trustlines).
- Consensus points:
  - CAP-0013 enables adding balances to others and simplifies token distribution.
  - SEP-0013 approach explicitly rejected.
  - Hard requirements need definition; Tom Q. designated owner.
  - Developer-friendliness and Account ID semantics must be addressed.

### Meeting Notes

- Inline notes (highlighted in blue in original thread) captured above.

### Follow-Up Actions

- **Jon Jove** to update CAPs based on email list feedback.
- **Tom Quisel** to revise and present hard requirements for trustline usability.
- **David** to submit a new proposal for TransactionEnvelope versioning to enable changes like CAP-0015.
