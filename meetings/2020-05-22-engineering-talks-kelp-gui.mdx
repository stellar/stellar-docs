- Today we're going to be talking about the Kelp GUI where anyone can create crypto.
- My name is Nicholas Har and I'm one of the developers for the Stellar Development Foundation.

Nicholas Har demoed Kelp GUI v1, showing how non-technical traders can spin up market-making bots on Stellar. He reviewed the starter template, explained how to pick base/quote assets, spreads, and order sizes, and showed how the app displays bids and asks as soon as the bot is live.

He also dug into the advanced tab—price correction knobs, amount multipliers, and safeguards to stop trading when exchange data drifts. The session finished with operational tips around canceling orders when you stop a bot so stray bids don’t continue filling unexpectedly.

Key discussion threads:

- What Kelp is, why the GUI matters for first-time liquidity providers, and how the starter bot wizard works.
- Tweaking spreads, order depths, and correction factors so bots quote realistic prices on thin orderbooks.
- Operational hygiene: monitoring the order list, stopping bots cleanly, and understanding when advanced settings are needed.

Today we're going to be talking about the Kelp GUI where anyone can create crypto. My name is Nicholas Har and I'm one of the developers for the Stellar Development Foundation. We're going to go over what is kelp, what is a Kelp GUI version one.
