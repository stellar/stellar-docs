## [Public Discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/x0Wrj2kuQ0U/m/CrId5QkoFwAJ)

### Agenda

- [CAP-0005](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0005.md) & [CAP-0006](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0006.md) - moving to approval.
- [Cosigned Assets Draft](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/146) - in draft since September; current approach considered viable.
- [CAP-0007 Revised Proposal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/drafts/draft-detacct.md).
- [CAP-0015](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0015.md) - Bump Fee Transactions update.
- CAP-0013 vs SEP-0013 (CAP-0007 + CAP-0008) - Change Trustlines to Balances.

### Meeting Notes

- CAP-0006 progressing with specific messaging for a targeted use case.
- CAP-0005 still lacks replace-by-fee and remains problematic.
- Deterministic accounts & creatorTxID (David):
  - Vastly simplified since prior iteration.
  - Salt mechanism needed; likely a full hash to prevent protocol rewind attacks.
- Cosigned Assets:
  - Related to [SEP-8 (Regulated Assets)](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0008.md).
  - NFT discussions considered orthogonal; may warrant a separate CAP.
  - Catalog of no-op operations discussed:
    - Payment to oneself
    - Bump op 0
    - SetOptions with no fields

### Follow-up Actions

- Johnny: coordinate CAP-0006 community and API updates.
- David: expand deterministic accounts draft and address CAP-0010/CAP-0015 implications.
- Orbit: consolidate NFT discussions and assess need for a separate CAP.
- Jeremy: review SEP-13A comments and address shortcomings in SEP-13.

### Trustline follow-up

The adjacent trustline-focused discussion reprised the agenda above and surfaced additional nuance around asset onboarding and NFT considerations. Tom and Orbit asked the group to clarify how cosigned assets should handle no-op operations, and David emphasized that NFT work is orthogonal but still worth cataloging.

- Tom asked for clarity on SEP-13A’s handling of edge cases, and Orbit volunteered to gather NFT-related requirements. The session reviewed the same high-level trustline-use case summary document in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_3KcBTbF7Diu_wu-ArvajYhEcPoDp9SgK5-dNruOK3c/edit#heading=h.8j5x6v50ft4p). That document lays out the anchor requirements around SEP-6/SEP-13 deposits and transfers so wallets set up user-facing flows that never require extra trustlines/XLM or manual follow-up steps, while also supporting sends to accounts that don’t yet exist.
  - Deposits must complete once the anchor receives the external asset, delivering funds to the user’s original account whether or not it has a trustline or even exists yet.
  - Users shouldn’t need to add additional XLM to finish a deposit, nor should anchors wait on any extra manual action once the deposit is underway.
  - The send requirements emphasize end-to-end usability: sends must arrive without the recipient doing any setup, and the document recommends keeping implementations as simple as possible to encourage adoption.
  - The group cataloged known no-ops (payment to self, bump op 0, SetOptions with no fields) and challenged attendees to bring simple, actionable alternatives rather than more complexity.
  - A short-term TODO list reiterated that deterministic accounts need a salt/hash to guard against rewind attacks, while CAP-0006 updates and SEP-13A comments should stay in sync with the evolving API design.

### Trustline follow-up actions

- Johnny: continue improving the DEX-focused messaging tied to CAP-0006 and sync with Jon on API revisions.
- David: add concrete deterministic-account examples, harden salt handling, and spell out whether those accounts supplant CAP-0010/CAP-0015 work.
- Orbit: collect NFT and Asset-object feedback to determine whether a new CAP is warranted.
- Jeremy: respond to Tom’s SEP-13A comments and close the remaining gaps in the proposal.
