## [Public Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1204462856037470248)

SEP-0042 introduces a standardized Stellar Asset List format intended to make asset discovery, curation, and presentation more consistent across the ecosystem. This meeting captures a community walkthrough of the draft along with broader discussion about ecosystem primitives and how developers experience Stellar + Soroban documentation today.

The session centered on what a token/asset list should contain, how lists might be curated and consumed (wallets, explorers, dapps), and where the ecosystem needs clearer conventions so that different clients can interoperate without reinventing metadata patterns.

### Key Topics

- SEP-42 Stellar Asset Lists overview
  - Motivation for a common, portable asset-list format
  - How lists can improve asset discovery, display, and trust signals in clients
  - Considerations for list hosting, versioning, and update workflows
- Ecosystem primitives enabled by standardized lists
  - Reusable metadata patterns for wallets and dapps
  - Interoperability expectations across clients consuming the same list format
  - How curated lists and community discussion can reduce duplicated effort
- Developer feedback loop
  - Documentation survey promoted to gather input on Stellar + Soroban docs
  - Using community feedback to identify gaps and prioritize improvements
