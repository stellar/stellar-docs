Tyler van der Hoeven kicked off the Engineering Talks series by breaking down path payments and why they let you move value instead of raw assets. He contrasted “vanilla” payments with multi-hop conversions across the DEX, showing how orderbooks, trustlines, and strict send/receive settings work together to route value without manual juggling.

He demoed the concept inside Keybase—using path payments as market orders to pay himself in new assets, converting USD tokens into a friend’s BTC balance, and then scaling the idea into an enterprise scenario where market makers seed USD/EUR books for wallets to tap. The closing Q&A dug into atomic execution, liquidity risks, market-making incentives, and how apps can treat users as on-chain liquidity providers.

Key discussion threads:

- Examples of practical flows: self-paying to simulate market orders, sending someone Bitcoin while spending USD, and embedding the same functionality in consumer wallets.
- How an “enterprise” implementation seeds orderbooks, manages trustlines, and keeps value flowing when users never touch the intermediate assets.
- What atomic path payments mean for price certainty, how strict send/receive protect users, and the need for better liquidity, tooling, and market makers on the Stellar DEX.

good morning still our community or afternoon wherever you may happen to be evening I don't know bill the night it's worth it to show up for this this is the first of our stellar engineering talks my name is Tyler van der Hooven and we're gonna be talking about practical path payments today if you have questions along the way or already have questions we have two places where you can put in your questions either on the stellar
