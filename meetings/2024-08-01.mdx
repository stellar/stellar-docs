1. Piyal demonstrated that Freighter's swap functionality is now served by [Soroswap](https://soroswap.finance/). It was previously served by Stellar Dex.
2. Freighter has made integration instructions available [here](https://github.com/stellar/freighter/blob/d248f2ad0aa03da72ea6eeaf7907ac0454fdcc72/extension/INTEGRATING_SOROSWAP.MD?plain=1#L2).
3. Esteban shared that [Palta Labs](https://paltalabs.io/) has created a DEX aggregator and made it available to all via the [Router SDK](https://docs.soroswap.finance/03-technical-reference/07-optimal-route/01-soroswap-router-sdk).
4. The Router SDK finds the optimal path for the swap in terms of swap cost across all dexes on Soroban.
