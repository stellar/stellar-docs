## [Public Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/897514728459468821/1267624969643229275)

Recent updates introduce a revised execution flow within Freighter that changes how certain operations are handled under the hood. The discussion focused on what has changed, how applications should adapt their integrations, and what developer tooling is available to support the updated approach. Overall, the aim is to provide a clearer and more maintainable integration path as the platform evolves.

### Key Topics

- Freighter swaps are now served through `Soroswap` instead of the Stellar DEX
- Developer integration guidance for the new swap path
- Palta Labs’ DEX aggregation work and its availability for general use
- Soroswap Router SDK:
  - Finds the optimal swap route by cost
  - Routes across multiple DEXs on Soroban via a single SDK interface
