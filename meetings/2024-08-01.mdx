1. Piyal demoed that Freighter swap functionality is now served through [Soroswap](https://soroswap.finance/). It was previously served through Stellar DEX.
2. Freighter published integration instructions [here](https://github.com/stellar/freighter/blob/d248f2ad0aa03da72ea6eeaf7907ac0454fdcc72/extension/INTEGRATING_SOROSWAP.MD?plain=1#L2).
3. Esteban shared that [Palta Labs](https://paltalabs.io/) built a DEX aggregator and made it available to everyone via the [Router SDK](https://docs.soroswap.finance/03-technical-reference/07-optimal-route/01-soroswap-router-sdk).
4. The Router SDK finds the optimal swap route by cost across all DEXs on Soroban.
