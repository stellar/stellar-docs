1. [Tommaso](https://github.com/heytdep`) ([`@tdep`](https://discord.com/users/905908451446779965)) proposed a core change to allow for extending instance and code TTL with separate values on the host environment to allow for more cost-efficient designs Proposal and discussion are captured in a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1447).
2. Tommaso received feedback on the proposal as well as implementation. Since it didn't require a metering change, core devs thought it to be a quick change.
3. The ecosystem voted in favor of the proposal by upvoting the post on Github Discussions. 13 votes were [recorded](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/).
4. As next steps, a CAP will be authored to capture the proposal and put forth for approval from CAP Core Team.
