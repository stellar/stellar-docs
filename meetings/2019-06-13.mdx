### Agenda

- David's Pre-Condition proposal: [CAP-0021](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0021.md)
  - After several iterations with the Channels working group, CAP-0021 was presented for decision.
  - Following discussion on its importance for payment channels and its fit within the current framework, the group agreed to move CAP-0021 to FCP: Acceptance.
- Clarifying final aspects of fee bump ([CAP-0015](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0015.md)), including questions raised in Nico's latest pull request:
  - https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/323
  - CAP-0015 will move to FCP: Acceptance after a final round of wording changes.
- If time permits, Jon to give an update from the trustlines/balances work.
  - Decision made not to discuss this fully until the draft is finalized, particularly around rationale and alternative ideas.
