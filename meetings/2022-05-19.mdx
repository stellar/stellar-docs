- welcome everyone uh we're trying out something new by holding the stellar protocol meeting here on the stellar stage in the stellar dev discord um we've been experimenting a bit with platforms the goal is to try to have these meetings in public so that people can see what's going on and can ask questions and can understand uh the thought process behind changes to the stellar protocol um but we also want to make sure that the platform is not buggy that it works that it's easy to reproduce the meetings um and it's that it's easy to attend them and so we're hoping that this works um we've tried a few different things if this doesn't work we'll keep trying things until we get the right fit but we'll see what happens today so uh bear with us um i will say that these meetings the stellar protocol meetings are designed so that we can discuss upcoming changes to upcoming versions of the stellar protocol in order to advance the protocol to meet ecosystem needs so a lot of the times what we discuss are caps core advancement proposals and this is where sort of new features that we're going to add to stellar are big changes to the stellar protocol uh start right and they are essentially technical specs that outline changes that we plan to make to the stellar protocol and um anyone can read these caps they're in a public github repo the discussion for these caps happens on a public mailing list and some of them also here in the stellar dev discord again if anyone is interested in this process or in understanding the caps um or in leaving feedback about them or asking questions we encourage you to do so and in fact if you're going to follow along with this meeting it's a very technical meeting so i would suggest taking a look at the caps in question at the moment we're focused on project jump cannon which will bring smart contracts to stellar and there are actually we've sort of modularized our approach to this we're taking different segments of the engineering work that needs to be done to make changes to the protocol to allow for smart contracts and created a series of caps each of which sort of addresses a specific portion of that work and so at the moment there are actually five caps that relate to smart contracts we have 46 47 48 49 and now 50.
- and over the past week there have been some changes to cap 46 and 47 and cap 50 is a new cap um today we're going to start to continue the discussion about these things and um you know as part of that we we certainly again encourage you to take a look at the caps encourage you to take a look at the mailing list and we in these meetings try to address some some questions synchronously that are important to discuss together but a lot of the work also happens asynchronously so i encourage everyone to follow along with that and so today um it's a fairly open-ended meeting um and i think i i don't know i i'm not even sure the exact best place to start i know that there may be some stuff to discuss on cap 47 i don't know if we're ready to discuss cap 50 yet or if we still have open questions about cap 48 and cap 49 um so i guess the the first question i have i guess lee is not here i know that there were a few questions about cap 46 but it looks like sid you may have addressed those questions um maybe we can get a quick review by john over cap 50 and the latest changes made there perfect thank you let's do that done great um we can open up there although i do think we probably should go back and talk about 47 what's in earth later i don't think we've actually spoken about it much in any of these meetings but let's let's start with some overview of what's going on on 50.

Alongside quick updates to CAP-0046 and CAP-0047, the team unveiled CAP-0050: the contract invocation transaction. The proposal rethinks how Stellar tracks ownership when a contract moves funds, introducing an `invoke contract` envelope that nests a Soroban-specific signature (the invoker) inside the usual decorated signatures. That allows developers to adopt an Ethereum-like `message.sender` model while preserving the classic account guarantees validators expect.

Discussion centered on the account model shift. Separating a contract invoker from the outer source account unlocks reusable signers, multi-party approvals, and delegated execution, but it also raises questions about aliasing, replay protection, and how CAP-0050 should behave when it calls other CAP-0049 asset adapters. Those trade-offs need to be nailed down before wallets can expose the new flows.

Key discussion threads:

- Anatomy of the `invoke contract` transaction and how its nested signature gives contracts a stable `get_invoker` primitive.
- How aliasing and delegation work when the transaction source differs from the runtime invoker, especially for contracts touching classic accounts.
- Replay prevention, signature reuse, and compatibility between CAP-0050 and the asset-interoperability work happening in CAP-0048/49.
