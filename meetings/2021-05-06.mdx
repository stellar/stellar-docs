Continuing the AMM design work, this meeting zoomed in on asset authorization and revocation. The team compared CAP-0037 and CAP-0038 through the lens of regulated assets: how should pools react when an issuer revokes a trustline, can LP shares exist without reserves, and what tooling is required to force redemptions when an address lands on a deny list?

Key discussion threads:

- Two enforcement models for CAP-0038: (1) revoke an asset trustline and automatically redeem any pool shares that depend on it, versus (2) keep trustlines intact but freeze pool positions so an issuer can compel redemption manually.
- How to keep LP share trustlines, pool accounts, and associated reserves in sync so issuers cannot delete trustlines with outstanding pool balances or leave partially redeemed positions behind.
- Ongoing open questions handed back to the mailing list: multiple pools per pair, parameter updates, AMP/DEX reserve sponsorship, and what UX signals wallets should display when an LP token is tied to an auth-required asset.
