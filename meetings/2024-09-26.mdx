Hoops Finance presented an overview of the DeFi platform they are building, with a focus on making decentralized finance more accessible to non-expert users. The discussion centered on how the protocol abstracts technical complexity while still exposing powerful functionality on Stellar.

The team walked through their approach to guided user experiences, liquidity provisioning, and automated market maker interactions, highlighting how developers and end users can interact with AMMs through simplified interfaces and public APIs.

### Key Topics

- Abstraction of DeFi investment complexity through guided, step-by-step user prompts
- Simplified liquidity provisioning that hides underlying LP mechanics from end users
- Public AMM API supporting both read and write access to AMM data on Stellar
- Developer-facing tools designed to enable easier integration with Soroban
