Join this Engineering Talk to learn about Stellar Quest, a new way to onboard developers through a structured series of practical challenges. SDF’s Ecosystem Evangelist, Tyler van der Hoeven, explains the goal—bridging “normie devs” into the network with a low-friction learning path—and demos how the experience works end-to-end.

Stellar Quest is organized into timed challenge drops (released on a schedule), completed on testnet so participants don’t need to buy XLM. Each challenge unlocks a collectible badge, and early finishers can win XLM prizes while supplies last. Tyler also explains how the team balances “enough hints to keep people moving” without giving away the full solution.

On the engineering side, the backend is built with Cloudflare Workers and KV storage, while the frontend uses StencilJS hosted on Vercel. For authentication and anti-sybil protection, Stellar Quest uses SMS-based login (with support paths for regions where verification is tricky). Prize claiming is handled through Albedo: users sign transactions in a non-custodial flow, while the app uses fee-bump transactions so users don’t need to pay fees when claiming prizes.

### Key Topics

- How Stellar Quest onboards developers with gamified, modular challenges on testnet.
- Challenge cadence: scheduled releases, badges for completion, and limited XLM prize pools.
- Architecture overview: Cloudflare Workers + KV, StencilJS frontend, Vercel hosting.
- SMS login as an anti-sybil mechanism (and how exceptions/support are handled).
- Prize claiming UX: Albedo signing, non-custodial design, and fee-bump transactions to sponsor fees.
- Why prizes may be queued (KV latency), and how more real-time primitives could improve it.

[00:00] Hello everyone. My name is Tyler van der Hoeven and I am very excited to be presenting on another engineering talk. Today we're going to be going through

[01:00] Stellar quest. This is a new app that I'm very excited about. Before we get started, though, a couple of little housekeeping items. As you all have questions as we're going through today's talk, you can either scan the qr code here on the screen to ask questions or just pop them into the youtube chat. We'll try and get to questions. So, as you have questions for me, be sure and pop them in there. We'll have a time for a Q&A at the end and then we're just gonna kind of walk through this application, Stellar quest. So it's been exactly a month actually. So, right on the heels of the big release of scf 2 0 there's been this long standing project that I've wanted to build, kind of filling in the gap between what I would call normie devs- you know, just developers that may not be familiar with cryptocurrency or have been very wary of jumping in- or even a lot of friends that I've had from

[02:00] Past jobs, wanting to introduce them to cryptocurrency, but having a bit of a gap like where do I get them started? Where do I sort of plant them? I can't, just send them documentation, I want to give them a nice landing pad for Stellar. So there's kind of in this gap here between the normie devs, developers that are good and enjoy what they do but are not familiar with cryptocurrency or Stellar and have maybe wanted to or would be interested but need a good landing place, a good onboarding, technical onboarding into interstellar, kind of away from all of the you know win moon conversations and pricing and stuff, but just want the technology. Like: help me understand from a technical perspective what's going on with these apps. So that is Stellar quest. It's this stepping stone between things like the scf and kind of being deeper into the technology and somebody who really knows nothing about cryptocurrency or the technology that powers it.

[03:00] So this is a very technical, focused challenge. It's a gamified application that I've built. So right after scf I started working on Stellar quest, so this has been a solo project that I've been working on over the past month and since this is an engineering talk, I think it's worth pointing out because it's interesting and it's super interesting to me. It's all built on cloudflare worker technology. I'm kind of a aws lambda- I love serverless technology, but really wanted to try cloudflare workers. So all the back end is built on top of cloudflare workers, their serverless architecture as well as their key value, pair storage, and then the front end is stencil js hosted on versal. So for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing, I think it's fascinating. I really enjoyed working with those tech. I love stencil js and cloudflare workers was a real joy to work with. Definitely looking forward to using that moving forward. I don't have a fancy

[04:00] Moving forward. I don't have a fancy slide deck. I will call out this one real fast, just as you find these things interesting or want to keep up with projects that I'm working on. Be sure and follow me, tyvdh, on twitter. And again, I'm the ecosystem evangelist at the Stellar Development Foundation. I don't have a big slide deck. We're going to actually be looking at the application itself. I'm going to walk through the app that I've built and how to use it so you'll get a little bit of a sneak peek. This is a challenge application. So for those of you who are lucky enough to tune in, you might get a little sneak peek at what we have coming with the upcoming first Stellar quest challenge. So I'm gonna go ahead and switch. I am going to unfortunately have to call out one of our third party services. Run kit is within the last 20 minutes actually is experiencing a pretty major outage, so some of our images, as well as challenge checking, isn't working right now. So if you see some broken images or we

[05:00] Encounter some unexpected errors, it's probably related to the run kit outage, but that's unfortunate. Hopefully it won't affect us too much, unless, of course, it's cloudflare that's having the outage, but I think it's just run kit. So Stellar quest: this is our landing page at the moment, calling out a little bit about what it is. Some of this is up for discussion, definitely looking for feedback, and you guys are getting a bit of a sneak peek, a first look at what we have so far. So, as you have questions or comments or kind of the dedicated Stellar fans, be sure and reach out with any feedback or ideas for how to improve these screens or the commentary that we have. But you can see right away that series 1 of Stellar quest will be launching on monday. So challenge 1 of series 1 is going live at 9: 00 a m this coming monday. So mark your calendars. There are XLM prizes as well as these fantastic fancy badges which

[06:00] You can't see right now because, again, we're using run kit to render some of those. So until run kits back up, those will be dead images, unfortunately for those of you again who is engineering talk. So these are badges. So we've got excellent prizes that are kind of a while supplies. Last sort of thing is: you, can you know, the first few people that complete each challenge will be eligible for XLM prizes and then anybody who completes a challenge will get one of these badges. So there's eight badges, there are eight challenges. Whenever you complete a challenge you unlock one of these badges. So it's kind of like the collectibles that you'll have on your Stellar account as you complete challenges. So these are not kind of one after the next. The first one launches on monday and then we wait until friday at 9: 00 pm, we've got a m and p m to make sure we cover everybody

[07:00] Across the globe. Eight challenges: first one launches on monday. So very excited for this to go live. Be sure and mark your calendars. And then, as you have people that have been interested in Stellar- maybe you've been wanting to onboard your developer friends into what we're doing here- be sure and send them the link, which will be `quests.stellar.org`. I'm not sure I include that in any slides so I'll make sure and call that out so let's go ahead and log in so got some legal stuff we've got my super secret dev login number we're using SMS codes to protect against civil attacks where one person can pretend to be many people if we use social or email it's very easy to duplicate those and just continuously log yourself in complete challenges and thereby claim all of the prizes as a single entity

[08:00] So by using SMS and only allowing actual mobile numbers you know no voice over ip numbers or landlines just mobile numbers connected to a valid network we block against a lot of that so that's why if you're confused why we're using SMS numbers that's what we're using for now to protect against the that's the anti sybil mechanisms that we're using same thing that we're using with the community fund verify that code and this will jump us to challenge number one now I'm going to give you a sneak peek of challenge one I'm going to try my best not to click on any other challenges so that you don't get too far ahead of us the challenge number one here is just creating an account so these challenges are all very modular and relatively simple if you're brand new to seller these might be like whoa what in the world is this but we've got helpful links brief commentary on what you're trying to do again these are challenges for prizes so we don't want to give away too much but the idea here is to give away enough information that people know where to go to complete the

[09:00] Challenge as well as not to lose them along the way so we'll kind of test and see where we can make improvements to kind of have that good balance between giving away too much and not giving away enough to keep the incentive to continue on with the challenges but so we've logged in we've got our first challenge all the challenges will be completed with the same testnet account so this right here is just the account seed or the account public key and you need to fund this account you can't directly fund it with friendbot you're going to have to figure out a way to do it probably through friendbot through another account or something like that hinted but these accounts will all be done using the testnet this entire series still requests will be divided into different series the first series is the one that we're launching now it's comprised of eight different challenges and these series will launch who knows you know maybe we'll do some partnerships with other

[10:00] Dev groups or just continue to launch these from the foundation I would love to see partnerships happen where there's lots of different series that are co branded with other entities and for each one of those you'll get a different public key that kind of links up to the different challenges and complete them all through there when we actually get to the claiming prize portion that's when you're going to connect a public key on the live network where you can claim prizes and actually have all your stuff on the live network but for the actual challenges everything's on test net so you're not gonna have to spend any money or go through coinbase or somehow figure out how to get lumens the idea again is just to understand the technology behind Stellar I've got a nice Discord channel if you guys want to join that once it's live we'll have some different discussion going on there as well as if anybody has problems or issues we'll try and build up a little community to support each other there's another thing I think worth calling out on the login there's a couple we're using

[11:00] The twilio lookup service and there are some issues with different countries or regions around SMS verification so if you're pretty sure that your number should work particularly like if you're using a voiceover ip number but that's your main number or that's what you're using to get around issues that you have with your network but it's not letting you in you would jump into the Discord channel there's a channel there for help login that we can white list your number to let you in even if you're using a voice over ip number or in a country that twilio doesn't support but you're still an individual single human being so that's worth calling out if you're having issues logging in there is some help for that in general though it should work fine so I'm assuming these check buttons trigger off on run kit they actually look at run kit to see if your account has performed the action

[12:00] That is required so I'm guessing that these buttons will yes throw some errors because run kit is done right now if you just can't figure it out and you want to just move on and kind of forfeit the cash prize but are still wanting to get the token you can click the shrug button here I don't know and it'll actually pop up a block of code straight from run kit which you can run it'll have pre populated in there your public and private keys so that when you actually go to run that code it will perform all the actions necessary to get your account to a passing state to where you could then check it and pass the challenge again you wouldn't get the XLM you wouldn't be eligible for the XLM prizes but you could still be eligible for the badge for completing the challenge and I'll let you move on to the next challenge so if you ever get stuck and you really just can't figure it out and you don't feel like jumping into Discord or asking for help which I really strongly suggest that you do you know try and get through it's the whole point but for some reason it's really stuck

[13:00] You can always just shrug out of it and then run the code that will spit out and then check it again and it should let you pass once you've completed challenges however and you're moving right along every so often we run a check on the back end which compiles all of the people who have completed the challenge and it runs them against it kind of compiles all those together runs them against our prize array to see who gets what based on when you completed the challenge and then it generates basically an ID which serves as a claimable prize so in this case I've got one waiting here for challenge one and it looks like I got first place in this lucky me local hosts you know not the most popular domain name at the moment for everybody else to join so I won first place got 500 lumens for challenge one see again this beautiful badge here

[14:00] And now I have the ability to claim this and so this is going to trigger the functionality to allow me to actually connect to or create or connect to a public account public key where a public network key rather and actually put this badge and 500 lumens into my account we do put a nice little call out here that's notifying that we're using albedo orbital lenses he's the guy who built StellarExpert developer good team they built albedo which is kind of it's a plug in but it's also just a pop up service that's a very low friction relatively low friction crypto wallet account that you can use straight from a browser both on mobile desktop safari any browser will do and that's what we're using to communicate between this website and the wallet so our non custodial

[15:00] Application that we'll be calling this account kind of building that relationship between making sure individuals are owning their own accounts and understanding what they're doing but also having the ease of access of communication between the browser and the actual wallet so I've got an account here that's been connected it's right now it's on the test net but recently merged away so we can we got a little bit of activity on here but it actually doesn't exist right now so the first thing it will do will be to create this account and then claim those balances and albedo I'm using implicit very similar to oauth where you don't have to continuously enter your password every single time you want to claim a prize so it's possible that I've actually got a session variable looks like it I don't right now so it'll pop a session variable in there when I run the implicit mode so when I first click claim it should pop up that window to allow me to actually connect

[16:00] To that into the password and then that will go and claim that balance looks like again we have a run kit issue so it won't actually let me claim this balance but the nice thing here is it should have assuming that error happened after yep we have that session so if I go and claim this again it shouldn't do the pop up it should just try and claim that prize again because we have the run kit issue won't actually let us claim it but once that run kit issue is cleared it'll take this balance it'll go and or I'll take this ID go and see that the public key that I've just sent along with the amount and the badge it'll create a transaction for me then it'll send it back for me to sign the implicit albedo session will sign that transaction and then actually send it back to Stellar quest backend and then the stutter quest backend is actually going to wrap that whole signed transaction in a fee bump transaction so that your users or I guess sell

[17:00] So that your users or I guess sell request users never have to pay fees themselves I'll be consuming all of the fees but I still get the really high throughput so if a lot of people are claiming prizes at the same time I don't have to worry about the sequence number because user accounts are consuming sequence numbers but my fee account is consuming all of the fees so a nice use case there of the fee bump that recently came out in Protocol 13 allows for a little bit higher throughput for claiming these prizes without having to have users actually pay the fees to collect their prizes so really honestly that's kind of it these challenges will come out every monday and friday again if we look back at our schedule you can see mondays and fridays 9 a m and 9 p m going from challenges one and two for four weeks all the way through to November six we'll be calling out things like meridian hackathon which is open and

[18:00] Ready for registration as well as things like the Stellar community fund particularly the lab fund so if folks are enjoying Stellar quests and really getting into the challenges there's places for them to go once we again I'd really like to have partnerships with other developer groups there might be opportunities for co branded links and really starting to open up the Stellar sphere to people that are not inside crypto that's kind of the whole point of Stellar quest is to really aim at normie dead steps that have not been involved in crypto before but are interested or at least willing to take a try so long as it's kind of that low barrier gamified entry level experience which is what we're trying to achieve again with Stellar quests so with that we will open it up for questions does anybody have questions about Stellar quest

[19:00] I'll just wait we've got our onca team looking through if there's any questions if there aren't you know if I explain everything so well of course there are no questions we'll wait a few minutes and see if anybody has anything to ask so one question you all should be asking is why do we have to wait why can't we just claim prizes as soon as we finish a challenge why do you have to put it into a queue that's an excellent question glad you asked it has to do with the fact that I'm real I really tried to use cloudflare exclusively for the back end so we're actually using their key value storage database if you will but it has a potential latency of one minute so you can imagine if people are completing challenges in one part of the world and people are

[20:00] Completing challenges in another part of the world if that's not in sync I could complete a challenge after you but claim the prize before you and so that's not that's no good so we have to wait until that potential latency has passed to allow everybody to claim the prize that they actually won by looking at time stamps once cloudflare actually announced last week a more real time synced they called durable objects I think it's in beta right now so once it reaches a stable release that'll allow us to do claims in real time so we won't have that kind of intermittent waiting period between completing a challenge and claiming the price for it you'll know immediately as soon as you finish it what place you got and whether or not you have XLM prize associated with it so excellent question next

[21:00] Another good one interesting one not really a question but something that'll be quite fascinating is once Protocol 13 I'm sorry protocol wait 14 goes live I think it's 13 I think the last one was 12 I'm a seller person I can actually remember goes live with claimable balances and sponsor reserves the whole process of claiming the prizes will be much easier one of the issues right now with claiming prizes is it's a badge so it's a custom asset that's stored on the blockchain which means I have to open up a truss line for it and so the there's a very real time opening up a truss line and issuing an asset that happens where I have to kind of just sit there and wait until you're immediately asking like hey I'm ready to receive this prize once claimable balances exist I can just say oh this person won this prize I'm going to set up an entry in Stellar that says here's the prize for this public key and it's out here which will allow you to claim it at any

[22:00] Point in time from any place you have access to that public key so rather than having to sort of have me and you both there at the same time to both ask for create the transaction for and then receive the prize those things can happen asynchronously which will make the prize claiming process much easier as well as you know if you claim the prize or you're eligible for the prize but for some reason you decide not to claim it I can leave myself as a claimant on that claimable balance and say after one day or after a week if you don't claim it I'm going to revoke it and put that prize back into the pool for somebody else to grab so very excited about claimable balances and then obviously sponsor reserves will be really nice because right now I'm actually creating accounts for people as they come in and are attempting to claim their prizes if their account doesn't exist on the ledger yet I put down the minimum balance for the account for it to exist as well

[23:00] As covering any fees for the assets that they're trusting so each of the badges has a 0 5 lumen reserve that's required for you to hold that asset so I give you all those lumens right now into your account it'll be really nice once we have sponsor reserves where I can just sponsor those for you rather than actually giving them to you so both of those new features coming out to the next protocol release will be amazing and will greatly improve that along with the durable objects from cloudflare will make Stellar quests just a little bit faster and honestly easier to manage from my end on the Stellar side so very excited about those it's been interesting actually building a production level application on top of Stellar so it's like a meta application where you're both teaching people about Stellar but also using it to teach them through the badges and the prizes and

[24:00] Actually trying to get all these things to work well where it's a very high friction to try and game it but it also is really low friction if you're just trying to use it's a lot of fun it's quite challenging to build an application like this where it actually works but it's been a ton of fun super excited to see what the future of it holds again as you have feedback be sure and leave it go through these challenges the first one on the public network is launching this next monday so all right if there are no questions thank you all for watching this has been a lot of fun looking forward to actually launching this live make sure again mark calendars get out there and good luck bye
