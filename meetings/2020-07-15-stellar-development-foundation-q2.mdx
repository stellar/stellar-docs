- danel dixon our ceo is going to kick things off in a moment with an announcement about our work with a fortune 15 company and to also share some other highlights and achievements we've worked towards in q2 and she'll be joined by bill bar height ceo of abra about the exciting work and products that abra's been working on and that are powered by stellar and justin rice our head of ecosystem at sdf he's going to provide some details on our technology updates and our overall network performance as well as share some more about our terrible charitable giving program that we just announced with our ecosystem partner loomanthropy and then our general counsel candace kelly is going to touch on sdf's growing visibility and our public engagement activities and the work we've been doing to increase our involvement in the policy dialogue so like i said a lot to cover and of course we'll leave some time at the end to answer any questions you have about today's presentation or the report that you should have all received just shortly before the call started and you can submit questions throughout the presentation in the chat box in the in the chat box marked q a in the left hand corner uh so with that i'm really excited to turn it over to our ceo and executive director danielle dixon for the moment we've all been waiting for danielle thank you lauren it's so awesome to be here thanks everyone for joining the call today i just really love these quarterly calls i actually really love going back and reflecting on the quarter that we just had so i'm really excited to be here and thank you guys for joining us uh so let's get started first i'm super excited to announce and to highlight um that in q2 we finalized sellers integration into samsung's blockchain key store so over the last several months we've been working closely with samsung to integrate stellar and i'm happy to announce that stellar end users are now able to securely store private keys on select samsung galaxy smartphones i've been saying this a lot lately but key management is an important part of how we will drive our technology into the mainstream and samsung provides a key management solution that is user friendly and will ultimately drive greater adoption of blockchain technology because it's so easy to use it's designed with the user in mind which is just a really really important thing that we need to continually focus on in blockchain this integration is also significant development for the great ecosystem of applications built on our network it's going to allow stellar ecosystem developers to create blockchain apps and services for samsung galaxy smartphones in addition to existing stellar-based products and applications it just opens up a whole new network of users that can benefit from the combined innovation of stellar and samsung we already have four stellar based businesses adopting the the required sdks to make their applications available in the key store this is including d stock and satoshi pay lightmint and nodal but our work with samsung isn't going to stop here we're committed to collaborating to expand and improve the blockchain ecosystem experience for consumers by working with developers who built who have built on stellar network and incorporated the appropriate sdks into their applications to utilize the samsung blockchain keystore and the integration into their applications so together we'll partner in an ongoing effort to recruit onboard and support developers in the stellar ecosystem it's just the beginning as we work together to empower more developers and users to leverage blockchain in the capabilities presented by this integration we're really proud of this development and it's reflective of the growth we're seeing in all aspects of our business so it's clear that 2020 has been a year unlike any others across industries we've all had to adapt to a new normal uh fortunately for sdf and for stellar we're continuing to grow and thrive even during these challenging times we've grown our capacity and our team we've brought exciting new leaders onto our board and we've made strategic advances on every core tenet of our roadmap to creating equitable access to the global financial system and i'm just so proud of our work in these areas so i want to just take you through the three pillars of our strategy uh first we've talked about our requirement that we foster sustainable use cases and so we're growing our anchor footprint in regions around the world we're building product and we're making strategic investments to be able to support this pillar second to ensure the robustness and usability of stuller so we've rolled out an upgrade to our core protocol we've expanded our developer tools and our network health when you look at the numbers is stronger than ever and justin's gonna go through that in just a few more minutes and then finally to be the blockchain that people know and trust we've fully embraced virtual visibility by making the rounds in virtual conferences and hosting 20 events of our own candace is going to share some of those highlights later in the call in addition to how we're getting more visible with policy makers and regulators so the tldr is that we've made significant progress in q2 on all of our goals our strategy seems to be working and i'm convinced more than ever that our progress is proving out to be a strong year for stuller so let me share some proof points first let's talk about what we're doing to foster sustainable use cases on stuller anchors are a fundamental part of our network to facilitate moving value from the traditional banking system into stellar and vice versa the network relies on these entities that we call anchors anchor services help create a world where the existing financial structure is connected and interoperable with stellar so this quarter we continued our focus on building strong anchors in strategic markets so this included bolstering the u.s anchor ecosystem with the addition of inclusive which offers compliance as a service and accounts and payment capabilities we also expanded on calories success in nigeria and we're supporting new anchors such as click pasa in tanzania anchor mxn in mexico and end tokens in brazil i just can't say how important anchors are it's an essential function for enabling frictionless movement of value between fiat currencies worldwide and we're going to continue to expand our anchor footprint in markets where the data indicates that the stellar network can have an outsize impact specifically for remittance companies serving businesses and individual lenders and payment processors we've also been building what we've talked about before which is our product a wallet called vibrant that saw its beta launch this quarter vibrant is a wallet that will soon be generally available in argentina where users will be able to hold share convert and send value it also showcases sep 30 seller ecosystem proposal 30 about key recovery mechanism that is very user friendly so i encourage you all to check it out even in the beta form and then the other important way we've been fostering sustainable use cases on stuller is by investing in businesses on the network we made two enterprise fund investments in q2 one investment in satoshi pay a platform for connecting the world through instant payments and one of the earliest adopters of stellar satoshi pay expanded their business to tap into a growing b2b cross-border payments market where there is huge potential for a player like them who has been in this space and knows the opportunities and the challenges the other investment went to opera a next generation financial platform which is facilitating opera's integration with stellar as its blockchain back end and offers expansion of financial services that will bring new products powered by stellar so to share more about this work and the progress they've made so far i'm happy to introduce bill barheit the ceo from oprah to the call thanks so much bill for joining us thank you for having me and uh good morning or good afternoon wherever you uh may be uh so i'm going to spend five minutes just giving you an introduction to abra's business and uh then danielle and i are going to speak a little bit so if you'd like to move into the the slides for um forever um so um just to give you uh those of you who don't know abra a quick overview of the services we provide abra is one of the more successful most successful wallets in the cryptocurrency space today although we have users now using abra for storing fiat and moving traditional money around as well hundreds of thousands of users in over 100 countries now i think we're approaching 150 countries and we've processed uh processing a billion plus in transaction volume yearly uh just just the ex team has executed extremely well over the last couple of years and we're really excited now to take this to the next level with stuller and we're really excited that they've joined our investor base including american express and foxconn and and arbor uh fidelity back fund so so just um let me walk you through some of the details on the next slide if you will of how this this all works so in order to provide this awesome service that we have we've had to build lots of capabilities both what we call our core capabilities as well as our core services for depositing earning interest borrowing investing uh and soon paying and spending and then of course all of the the back-end capabilities that go into effectively running a fintech financial technology company let me walk you through a couple of those uh now and i'll go to the next slide so so what everybody knows of course in the front end is the ability to invest uh as the world's beloved cryptocurrency investing wallet app um we basically work with lots of exchanges and lots of partners to facilitate the buy sell hold and transfer of dozens of cryptocurrency assets and now lots of um assets and we run a very large liquidity system to allow consumers in lots of countries to get money in and out of the system both in fiat uh via the banking system bank wires ach what most of us in the us would know as well as cash network so that folks in for example in southeast asia philippines or in central america like in guatemala can actually use cash in their pockets to get money into the abra app and then withdraw cash from the abra app and to do that we've built a network of retail partners to process deposits and and withdrawals into the app it's very complex difficult uh part of our business but it's actually growing uh it's actually growing faster even than the uh the bank part of the business which is really exciting it's been exploding the past uh the past few weeks in particular so that's something we're really excited about on the next slide i give you um if we go to the next slide there might be a slight delay can you are you earn interest i see it so so sorry about that so yeah so just to give you a little sneak peek on some other capabilities this is the interest earning capability that we're going to be uh launching in the next couple of weeks this allows consumers uh for example people who not even aren't even familiar with cryptocurrency to store dollars and earn significant interest on those dollars or actually our existing crypto users can can earn interest on their on their deposits as well we'll be supporting staking uh currencies to earn interest there uh and other other currencies over time um so in the next slide you can see uh that in addition to uh you know just what we the interest earning on the front end uh we've built a very sophisticated uh lending system where we have uh very large institutional partners uh that are vetted in our risk management processes and basic are borrowing those funds in order to generate high yield for for our consumers and that is that includes everything from minors hedge funds large exchanges other loan originators and this is a good segue into what we're working on with stellar so if you'd like to go to the to the last slide um really the next the next phase for abra is is as i alluded to for us to take this to another level is building an entirely new uh part of our business in order to facilitate the movement of funds globally in real time using the stellar network and to do that and what that will enable for us is all forms of global lending the first uh kind of generation of lending that you hear about in the crypto world has to do with uh people leveraging themselves to go along in crypto or people borrowing against their bitcoin or ethereum holdings we want to take this to another level and and use the stellar platform to truly enable traditional banking applications at global scale uh trade finance rights cross-border uh p2p loan origination uh loans like that for example that are very difficult for people in the west to take advantage of in many cases we think are uh totally possible now leveraging the power of of crypto and and distiller platform so this is just a quick kind of peek as to uh what's coming and what we're really excited about to be working on with stellar so um i'd be happy to uh answer any any questions well thanks bill well thank you the idea of me being the one to ask you questions i've been on your podcast so now it's my turn i get to ask you a few uh one of the things i wondered is you know we talk a lot about financial inclusion in blockchain and i just wondered like from your standpoint how is aubry focused on financial inclusion and what are the um how do you think about that from your business side that's a great question we see financial inclusion as basically leveling access and creating a level playing field for access globally so that somebody in i mentioned philippines earlier you know a farmer in the philippines in in mindanao for example where we actually have users at abra can access the same services in a banking app as an investment banker in san francisco which is a place where we also have users and i think abra is one of the first companies to really try to create a level playing field across all of these different uh geographies in a way that doesn't really differentiate from person to person obviously in terms of how people might get money in and out of the out of the system would be different for a cash user in southeast asia versus a banked consumer in san francisco but other than that the core services they want in terms of the ability to invest and earn uh the ability to borrow the ability to uh send and share funds they're all the same the amounts might be different but the ideas and and the basics of what they want are effectively the same and our goal is to enable that globally and do you think that in our industry we're already making strides to really uh push this notion of financial inclusion forward well it's i think it's a mixed bag i think that um there's a lot of people kind of at the at the bottom of the income pyramid who've done fantastic work in building kind of micro finance services that's really hard it's very expensive um it's generally not self-sustaining uh with some exceptions um in mexico and india i think we've seen some examples of how microfinance can be self-sustaining but when you move into the middle of the income pyramid which is where abra is more focused it really becomes more about creating a a holistic uh kind of global oriented user experience that most banks don't understand they focus on bank branches they focus just purely on compliance compliance is obviously very important but it has to fit in with the user experience and we're starting to see this in some of these challenger banks particularly in europe and and in latin america that are gaining traction and that's very encouraging and i think i think you're going to see kind of a whole other generation of these challenger kind of services now that are just going to leave the banks in the dust okay so now i want to move a little bit back to stuller and would love to just have your few thoughts about why you selected stellar and why you thought stellar was a great entity a great chain to build on sure i think for us we're big believers in leveraging the power of cryptocurrency technology blockchain technology and now stable coins which has become kind of a flavor of the month but it's simply a way of leveraging cryptocurrency technology to represent traditional value on a blockchain to facilitate real world banking applications the first generation of all of this whether it's the deep fi which the flavor of the month have all been around crypto for the sake of crypto and that's fine we needed to get where we are somehow but we're excited about making this globally accessible for traditional banking applications many challenges there one of the biggest challenges we faced in just the kind of the 1.0 of abra was scalability a lot of what we originally built for example was built on bitcoin and it just wouldn't scale right so what we need is the ability to have a platform that can can create these stable coins but can scale to truly global uh applications in time and space for us in a way that the kind of a lot of the first generation platforms could not and that's where we think stellar truly shines all right i love that um now let me just ask you one more question before we turn it over to justin and uh if you think about the rest of the year and what a strange year it's been what is the one thing that you would love to see in this space change and develop by year end uh so that we could actually blow things up in 2021 yeah that's a great question so a lot of the first generation of stable coin products have been very us-dollar-centric there's a little bit of a few um examples of other things but i would really like to see some major g10 currencies um really go for or accompany startups start to develop some g10 currencies beyond the dollar using stablecoin technologies like stellar or others and start to see a lot of traction in uh forex applications money transfer remittances uh cross-border business payments that start to take advantage of this ability to do on the wire money transfer if we see that then we know that we have real proof points for crypto being useful in the quote unquote real world and we know it's coming it's just a question of is it going to happen you know in the next few months you know the next year et cetera et cetera but that would personally excite me the most it may sound boring but that's what it's going to take to make this really useful at global scale so awesome that would be great to see that happen thank you so much bill for joining us and i know that you'll be available uh afterwards for also questions so at this point i'm going to turn it over to justin who's going to walk us through some network stats and other things that he wants to share with us great thanks to now thanks bill i'm justin rice head of ecosystem at sdf and i'm super excited to be here to share more about the continued growth of the network and the development of stellar technology so stellar is open source and open participation and many of the advancements sdf makes are in collaboration with our ecosystem in these uncertain times when it's clear so many are struggling we've been asking ourselves how can we work with our ecosystem to make a difference now of course we believe the technology we're working on will help address some key underlying issues over the long term but we also continue to ask ourselves what can we do to help today so we've decided that part of our short-term answer is to continue our partnership with lumenthropy which is a stellar-based platform for charitable donations this time to rally our community to support an organization deeply relevant to today's challenges the usf institute for non-violence and social justice which is a 501c3 driving research education and advocacy to advance the practice of transformational non-violence so for the entire month of july we will match lumen donations made by our community to the institute up to two million lumens we kicked off the campaign with a 100 000 lumen donation and we're excited to see what our community will contribute to make the world a better more generous and more compassionate place now let's take a look at this quarter's numbers and talk a bit about what they mean um so here are some key network stats and we'll sort of go through them quickly the number of accounts on the network has been stable hovering around 4.5 million total we've seen a slight increase in the number of daily operations up 9 from q1 and that represents solid network throughput and speaks to the scalability of the network there was a significant uptick in average daily trading volume on stellar's decentralized exchange um this quarter we saw about 5.9 million lumens worth of trades per day which is a 70 increase from last quarter the total number of payments has also grown consistently over q2 9 million to more than 13 million uh as of june 30th there were 7 893 on-chain assets which is a lot i think it's important to note that we're working on a method to distinguish and measure meaningful assets uh those are assets that contribute to the connected financial financial infrastructure that we're trying to build assets very in line with the anchor strategy that danel mentioned earlier and many of these 7000 plus on-chain assets will be beyond the scope of our area of focus but one thing is for sure people find it very very easy to issue assets using stellar lastly let's take a look at where the network is in terms of health and decentralization there are currently 23 tier 1 validating nodes and about 120 nodes total that's about the same as last quarter and what we mentioned then bears repeating the network would continue uh it would keep going even if the sdf turned off all of its notes what's more encouraging is that we're seeing more organizations in the pipeline to join the ranks of the tier one validators and that's because there are more businesses invested in the network want to increase their engagement and are capable of doing so those tier 1 validators are fundamental to the health and stability of the network they're also important to its governance and they help drive important upgrades to the network like the adoption of protocol 13 and q12 so protocol 13.
