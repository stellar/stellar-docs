- i think that's our cue hello everyone and welcome to the stellar open protocol discussion um as always in these meetings we discuss core advancement proposals aka caps um caps are technical specs that suggest changes to the stellar protocol in order to allow the protocol to continue to drive forward make progress evolve to meet the needs of the ecosystem these meetings if you're watching this is probably pretty obvious are live streamed um so that you can follow along i do want to know this is a very very technical discussion right so if you're watching you probably want to take a look at the caps that are linked to in the show descriptions as are the previous conversations about those caps on the stellar dev mailing list i'm not going to identify all the participants they're also listed there so you can look them up they're qualified um so today what are we doing today we will again discuss cap 42 multi-part transaction sets which was what we discussed last time but it's been significantly revised since that discussion um we are also going to have an initial discussion about cap 44 speedx configuration and we'll get into what those proposals entail in a minute um but first i want to give a quick word about the life cycle of a cap and there's a purpose for me saying all this that i'll get to um so this meeting is really just part of the process of the creation and implementation of a cap open discussion about caps it happens on the stellar dev mailing list there's a link to that in the event description as well so if you want to join that's the current discussions or future discussions sign up for that mailing list caps are drafted and um sort of iterated on based on the async feedback and suggestions that come in via that list before they end up here being discussed in this meeting so in this meeting we go over very specific questions and the goal is to get a cap ready to move on if a cap is ready it may be put up for a vote before the cap committee um and they decide on whether or not to accept it so after a cap committee vote by the way the cap enters into a one week final comment period and that gives everyone a chance to sort of raise questions again on the stellar debt mailing list if cap makes it through a final comment period it's implemented in a major stellar core release before that stellar core release actually hits the network validators have to vote to upgrade the network to accept that release and so ultimately any sort of proposal that makes it into implementation into a stellar core release is accepted by the network through that governance mechanism so part of the reason i'm bringing all that up today um is that before we go on to the main discussion about caps 42 and caps 44 we're going to revisit a couple of caps cap 21 which generalizes transaction preconditions and cap 40 which adds a new signer type that multiple parties can use to more effectively share a transaction set for signing so these are two caps that we sort of got pretty much across the finish line they have they basically include changes that are helpful for people that are looking to develop innovative solutions on stellar specifically payment channels and bridges to other network the goal of these is to sort of unlock the potential for greater interoperability so again these caps they already went through the ringer they're currently in a waiting decision so that's their official status awaiting decision but uh first things first i think the cap committee is ready to approve both caps and so i want to check in with the cap committee and see if that's true now the cap committee is uh jed and nico and david and jed who is not here i checked with before and he is ready to approve um nico and david are you also ready to approve or is there more to talk about for capital 21 david you approve okay yeah it's the same for me yeah yeah same for me uh like the there was a change yesterday or the day before on cap 40 but it's uh yeah it's a minor change so we're good all right approved so after this meeting um i'm going to change the status of those caps to final comment period pending approval and again that gives everyone a one week window to like raise any final questions or concerns um i guess if a legitimate concern comes up during that time we can send it back to draft mode but if there's no concerns legitimate concerns that arise during that time those caps will be approved and that means they're going to be ready to move on to implementation for inclusion in the next protocol release which is protocol 19.
- so as of right now shortly after this meeting cap 21 and cap 40 officially move into final comment period all right now on to the real meat of the matter um we're going to talk about these two caps and the first one that we're going to talk about is cap 42 multi-part transaction sets this cap gives validators control over which fee policy to use for individual transactions included in a ledger um we discussed it two weeks ago and there were several suggestions about how to improve it and based on those suggestions uh it was revised and so i think to start with let's just get a quick overview of the changes to cap 42.

Two weeks later the group revisited CAP-0042 with its updated language and run-time examples. They stress-tested how validators will toggle fee policies per lane, what happens to transactions that do not fit a published policy, and how the new wording avoids starvation while still letting arbitrageurs bid independently.

They also kicked off a first look at CAP-0044 (SpeeDEX configuration) and walked through the Core Advancement Proposal life cycle so the community knows when CAP-0021 and CAP-0040 will enter final comment ahead of Protocol 19. That schedule matters to downstream operators who need to update horizon, SDKs, and dashboards before the new fee plumbing goes live.

Key discussion threads:

- Ensuring the revised CAP-0042 text gives validators clear discretion over which policy to apply to each lane without fragmenting mempools.
- Mapping out how a SpeeDEX lane will be parameterized in CAP-0044 so aggregators can predict how much order flow they may submit each ledger.
- Communicating the final-comment windows for CAP-0021 and CAP-0040 (both targeting Protocol 19) so implementers know when the specs freeze.
