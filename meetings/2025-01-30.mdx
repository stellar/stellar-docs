[00:00] Welcome everyone to this week's Stellar Developer Meeting today I have a very busy guest who fortunately made the time to to come here today it's Andre from RampMeDaddy and I'm going to let him on the stage as well hello Andre hi garon thanks for having me great to be here hi everyone yeah great to have you here you've been very busy I Met You in San Francisco on Monday and it seems like a lot of things are going on. But can you maybe just start by introducing yourself and your team and and what you're working on yeah absolutely happy to my name is Andre I'm the co-founder CEO of RampMeDaddy was born at at a consensus hosted by EA guys amazing amazing time amazing it's it was a lot of fun and and we rode, that wave

[01:00] of fun and we rode, that wave of fun for the past whatever seven months at this point, that has turned into a real company, that's seeing real traction we're getting a lot of positive feedback we. So RampMeDaddy right. Now is a telegram digital wallet designed for Global Payments and for mcoin trading mcoins have been super hot and on on you know on super hot and on you know on and and more more chains are picking it up. So we're super excited about, that ultimately the goal is to be multi-chain wallet for for mem coins multi-chain wallet for mem coins but. When it comes to payments I mean, that's, that's something, that we started rent rent Maddy at the core of sending Global Payments and we want to make it as easy as sending a text message and Stellar has been extremely helpful with, that great. So so how far along are you in the process I know you've been working hard on it for for quite some time. But what

[02:00] on it for quite some time. But what is the status today how how far along is the status today how far along are you yeah no it's. So today actually this call I'm doing out of the Draper University building facility we are just wrapping up our Draper University accelerator. So we did a three-week pre accelerator back in August, that was amazing time very had a very impact on what we're building got to meet a lot of amazing people well actually I think, that's, that's. When we met for the first time and actually got to work together we. But we were also able to meet denell we were able to pitch to Tim Draper we were able to accomplish a lot of things in just three weeks after, that I think we you know we we showed our think we you know we showed our strength we got people interested in what we're building and Draper

[03:00] University and Stell invited us back to the official accelerator, that's not 3 weeks it's 12 weeks and we have been just crushing it here with with with a team of 10 other companies building Innovative products and the idea the reason, that we decided to go with telegram in the first place is. Because telegram has a billion users worldwide and a lot of these users are in U you know there's a lot in United States. But there there there's United States. But there there's users from everywhere in the world I think there's a number of groups where, that I'm an active participant in with people from I think we we did some people from I think we did some calculations and it's about 40 countries. So I think it's amazing, that you know telegram brings it all together and we figured well let's let's see how we we figured well let's see how we can facilitate payments inside, that and. But before we get into payments obviously we need to be able to

[04:00] on-ramp onchain. So at the hackathon we built the on-ramping solution and we kind of have iterated a number of I don't want to say pivot. Because pivot usually to me see sounds like it you were doing something. Now you're doing something else I think we just re refined and reiterated in our idea to hit both I mean I it's to hit both functionality and revenue and those are two important pieces of any business and I think we I think we're finally at a point where they're they're put together point where they're put together and it it makes and it makes sense okay we were trying to get a screen share going did you get it to work yeah let's I think. So it would be fun to see see it in action it would be fun to see it in action yeah. So I guess let me start with the. So RampMeDaddy is a telegram wallet

[05:00] that we're still building I would, say I think our CTO will be not super happy with me. But I I'll say maybe four to six weeks is left. But so. So we're going to roll it out. But I think there's a big strategy to how you roll things out. Because you can spend all of this time. And then roll out a product. And then start driving traffic to, that product. When it's live we decided to take a different approach we decided to roll out a teaser game inside telegram it's a very simple game you just guess. If the Bitcoin price is going to go up or down you tap on it. And then 5 seconds later it tells you. If you're. If you won or lost. If you won you get 10 points. deducted so, that's, that's the game in a nutshell we have been seeing a lot of positive feedback on, that game

[06:00] and it's amazing to see how just walking around Draper University I would be passing by someone and I see someone sitting on the couch tapping playing the game so, that's, that's the idea we game so, that's the idea we were able to secure a couple of Partnerships with other telegram games, that have communities of millions of people I think between the all of the partners, that we have right. Now there's 50 million people in the community for those games and we have a very strategic partnership where they will drive traffic to our game and, that will engage players with our game and we get to tap into the $50 million Community sorry 50 million people community in those games so, that's. And then after the players are happy and they're excited with with a game they're they're excited with a game they're familiar with a brand. Then we'll start promoting the wallet to the to these clients and kind of it's it we expect it to be a much simpler conversion to get people to use the wallet. So it's

[07:00] there's a strategy for the game it might seem like okay well what what does the seem like okay well what does the game have to do with, that. But we put a lot of thought into it and did a lot of research and the client feedback to before we built it. So but yeah happy to share I just wanted to give some background. So people are not confused about what's going on here. So let me try to share my telegram window so. If you go to are you able to sh see my telegram window yeah awesome. So let's see so. If you go at RampMeDaddy bot and you type type this in daddy bot and you type this in RampMeDaddy bot you can click Start and you can hit launch we launch the game and are you able to see the game no I don't see the game oh man it's probably. Because it's a window, that's shared not the screen yeah let me okay let me try to showare the this screen. So but you saw how we hit

[08:00] the yeah the launch button let's see so. When after you hit the launch button the full screen let's see I wonder. If this is going to work it's not going to look as good as it looks on the okay let's see are you able to see the game. Now y we see the game okay sweet. So I mean obviously it looks a lot more organized on the screen. Because it's just the screen size. But you can see the Bitcoin price changing here. And then I would guess, that it's going up 5sec passes passes by a loss, that's, that's why I don't by a lot of day-to-day trading. But keep going keep trying and

[09:00] win. So and this is basically it in the nutshell what we found to be very exciting for people is the leaderboard and funny enough we have a rot I hope I'm saying it right with his Stellar logo, which is super super exciting and what's even more exciting is, that there's two people who play this game more than I do and I feel like I refer. So many people to this game. But you know we have mounder Trevor Trevor Hoffman he he mounder Trevor Hoffman he shows it a lot sends it to a lot of people. But these two guys have absolutely crushed it and it's amazing to see this support from these people. So you get 10 points for guessing the price right you get Five Points deducted for guessing it wrong and you can also invite friends. So this is a very important feature for us for the future of the product development for the wallet itself we allow you to earn points every time

[10:00] you refer a friend and. If you click invite friends it allows you to it gives you a customized link, that you can share with your friends. But other than, that this is the game it's not a crazy amount of stuff, that has been, that has, that that, that has been been, that has, that that has been built. But it is an engaging fun game, that has been allowing us to attract clients and U talk to clients to get their feedback and see what they want in the market I think it's personally I think it's a brilliant idea it's a great way to to get some people excited get get some awareness around what you're building and and and your brand and something, that's, that I've always noticed H I'm actually surprised you're not wearing your RampMeDaddy CAP today you got the T-shirt. Because you guys are always promoting your business always

[11:00] so I've personally experienced it like Monday. When we had the event in s Francisco there was RampMeDaddy water bottles there was every everywhere and and When when you guys said, that it was time to get go out and get changed for the event I was thinking okay maybe these maybe they going to show up in suits today. But no it was t-shirts with RampMeDaddy all over it and yeah know it's I mean I think it's worth mentioning talking about the Geo yeah and the idea I even heard a story from one of the other participants from from drew other participants from drew there was something about, that you guys went out to eat at a restaurant and I guess they were out on napkins or something. And then out of your bag you pull napkins with RampMeDaddy QR code and logos on it yeah yeah yeah we we we logos on it yeah yeah we we tried to get creative with The Branding I think

[12:00] there is I mean I think. When it comes to branding it's a very it could be a very expensive and resource consuming really bottomless bit of just branding and marketing money, that you can put in and we know, that firsthand from you know our previous company, that we were at itust amazing brand the strongest brand and it's very important for itust was doing crypto IRAs. But unfortunately don't have the budget of itust Capital right. So we have been trying to come up with the creative strategies to to do brand creative strategies to do brand awareness without spending a lot of money on it and I think, that's, a strong strong, that that has to be present for a found founder to be successful to scale a retail facing product. So yeah I completely agree and some I've sometimes have discussions with

[13:00] with other Founders in in the crypto with other Founders in the crypto blockchain space and sometimes they have a difficult time onboarding non- crypto people or non- crypto users and I think by introducing the game first and by creating some awareness some curiosity around your brand I think is a great way to onboard people who are maybe not super much into crypto or meme coins and get them excited about it and I think, that's, that's something think I think, that's something, that that I think is really going to be interesting to follow you guys and see see your gain some tracks and get those people, that may not be super familiar with having to co coins or tokens or NFTs make it more like an everyday thing I think you're doing a great job with, that. So yeah it'll be interesting to follow we only have a few minutes left. But I'm super curious about what does your timeline look like. When it comes to the wallet and and be

[14:00] when it comes to the wallet and be able to toh to have to use meme coins. So the timeline for the wallet is we're we're I am personally hoping for about six weeks and I you know. So far I think we've been very strong on delivering everything, that we promise on time So we're trying to stick to, that history in traction. But we have been there's there's no shortage of have been there's no shortage of stuff to to do. While the product is not out and I think establishing strong presence in brand is definitely one of those things, which is what we've been working on very hard as far as the wallet and the mem coins we we as to launch in in the are going to launch in the next six weeks with a with with a set of next six weeks with a set of with most likely with a closed beta for for some of the users to give us

[15:00] feedback and we've been yeah we've been moving towards, that that's super exciting Okay I think, that's all we have time for today. But I would love to do a followup. When when you hit the do a followup. When you hit the maybe. When you hit test net or hit the main net maybe do a followup and see how it looks like. But so far it's been super exciting to to follow follow been super exciting to follow your journey and yeah see see the hustle your journey and yeah see the hustle you do to to get people excited about it I think, that's, that's something a lot I think, that's something a lot of startups can learn a lot from. So thank you so much for joining today absolutely thank thank you very much and our goal is to drive adoption for crypto and blockchain, which is extremely hard to do. If you have to worry about all the seat phrases all of the all of these Crypton native things and as you know I want people I already got my mom pretty involved in crypto she

[16:00] has crypto in her Ira she has crypto wallets she does all of, that my next goal is to get my grandma involved and she is she's gonna be a client of a customer of RampMeDaddy and she'll be trading memes H so, that's, that's, that's the goal and, that's what we're working towards, that's amazing okay thank you so much for joining today and I'm looking forward to doing a followup. When when you have more to share I think, that could be interesting to do awk thank you so much for joining thanks for having me thank you bye bye, that was all we had time for today for the regular Stellar Developer Meeting in about five minutes we'll shift over to Discord where we have a protocol discussion today and both this this meeting and the the both this meeting and the protocol discussion meeting will be available as as a recording later So thank you for joining everyone bye

[00:00] All right welcome everyone to today's protocol meeting where where we'll discuss two Core Advancement Proposal Gren will be speaking about CAP 65, that introduces a reusable module cache, which Garand actually alluded to last week and after, that Dimo will speak about CAP 64, which pertains to sbon authorization and memos with, that I'll hand it over to grden. So this is a probably smallest CAP, that I've done. So far and certainly the simplest to describe U. But it does actually have a fairly dramatic effect effect this really only makes sense in in the context of CAP CAP 62. So this is CAP sorry no I'm CAP 62 this only makes sense in the context of the other CAP yeah no no sorry I'm doing CAP 65 this makes sense in the

[01:00] context of CAP 62 sorry getting all my 60s tangled up here. So in 62 Garen pointed out, that we in a position where we can basically keep the live letter state in memory constantly. Because of the the the ability to you know evict live state to disk and and account for the movement of of data between dis and memory explicitly in in protocol events, that are surfaced to the user. So the user can tell you know what what they're paying for and and what they're getting out of paying for the things being in memory versus you know allowing a detail to expire and and having it move to dis and, that that obviously produces the ability to reduce IO costs. But there's another thing, that we can do on, that that, that load or evict event. When when things move from dis to memory or memory to disk, that actually sort of solves a problem for us, that we have had for a long time, that has been holding us back from doing something very obvious. So it's a very

[02:00] obvious optimization, that we've wanted to do since the beginning of Soroban, which is to Cache the compiled ready- to run version of Any Given smart contract in memory and it's ready to run form. So the the wasm bite code, that you upload is essentially not ready to run it's it hasn't it has been validated. When you uploaded it. But theoretically it should be validated again before running. But also it gets translated into a sort of a secondary internal format for execution and in the future. If we ever use a jit this will actually be an even more involved process. But there is nonetheless even with an interpreter there's a translation phase and the important thing to understand is, that translation phase is fast. But it still takes time and you want to run your transactions as fast as possible. And so at the moment. If you look at. If if you sort of look at a execution profile of a contract. When it's running today. When you invoke a contract your transaction actually spends a fair amount of its time in many cases as much as half or or even 2ir or three4 of its time just to during the doing the the

[03:00] translation getting it ready to run coming from. So so we pull the bik code off of dis. And then we retranslate it. And then jump into it and execute it. And then basically throw, that away and the reason we and. And then do it again for the next trans transaction and the next transaction and we do this over and over again. Because we don't really have a clear way of. If we were to cash it from one transaction to the next deciding who should pay for populating the cash and who should be able to B basically free ride on things already being in the cach and how to sort of reflect, that in the fee model U there's a lot of complexity here I don't really want to go into all the different options I mean I'm sure you can think of a way of making it work off the top of your head many people have we talked about this a lot. When we were developing the structure of Soroban and we couldn't really come up with one, that didn't have some weird incentive, that allowed people to you know price other people out of the transaction queue in in a way, that was unfair or or wound up making them overpay in certain circumstances in ways

[04:00] that we wouldn't be able to refund stuff like, that. So ultimately up until. Now we have not done, that up until. Now for the first year sort of year or. So of of zoran's existence it has executed in this fairly wasteful fashion where it is reparsing retranslating modules from their serialized WM form into their ready to run form on every single transaction and, that that has been something we know you know we want to get back to we know we want to figure out the correct way to deal with it it longer term and have longer lived caches of, that translated form and. And so with CAP 62 our our opening became obvious this is the clear opening where we can do it and in fact we can do the most aggressive form of it. Because there's this very large amount of data, that will be kept in in memory all the time, which is essentially the entire live part of this orbon part of the bucket list so, that's you know to do levels of

[05:00] filtering here but. If you sort of step back the the contracts, that are in the live portion of the the Ledger themselves collectively we've done some measurements they're not very big all told it's you know 10 megabytes or something right. Now it's not actually a ton of data even. If we saw substantially substantial growth in in the blockchain sort of all anticipated scenarios don't show it exceeding memory and CAP 62 really makes it clear, that there's a model for bounding, that growth and for charging for it appropriately so, that as, that growth occurs you know we can manage essentially pressure on it to keep it under control to to have it have not become arbitrarily huge and, that means the caching question just gets very simple we just cach everything as soon as something is pulled off of dis we're just going to immediately compile and cache it we we'll translate it into its ready to execute form and we'll just stick it in reusable cash and we will reuse, that cash from from one transaction to the next. So all of the per transaction

[06:00] costs for for translation go away and, that's like, that's the whole CAP it's actually very straightforward in the context of 62. So I've talked a lot to sort of give you the background for it. But the actual CAP itself is is utterly trivial there's nothing to it as soon as you turn it on your costs just just drop through the floor you everything just goes faster and it's cheaper. So pretty easy sell I don't think there's an awful lot of reason to object to it unless you can think of a reason why you don't want to you know avoid doing work multiple times s it's it's just a freebie we really should have done this earlier on it's just we didn't know how to make it work and, and now we have a fairly clear model for making it work. So I've already implemented this I've run the experiments on mainnet running it in parallel on a local development validator and it's much much cheaper substantial cost cost savings there are a couple of interesting Corner cases to deal with in terms of like like. If you upload a contract. And then try to run it inside the transaction, that you

[07:00] inside The Ledger, that you uploaded it in so. If you do like an upload and run immediately we have to be a little bit careful there in terms of like. When the cach gets repopulated or incrementally populated with sort new additions. But the worst case scenario of all of those is just, that you get charged today, which is the the you know you get charged the cost of translating it on the fly in addition to the cash population, which we're just going to eat those costs entirely we're not even going to include the cost of cash population and eviction. Because they're. So much lower than the io cost of even bringing stuff in a note of memory in the first place. But there there's there's a little bit of sort of careful accounting to to make sure it all works. But essentially the the user experience is just everything goes faster. So should be very straightforward I don't. If anyone has questions I'm happy to answer them. But I would be surprised. Because there there's really not much to this CAP except cash work and

[08:00] yeah. So regarding the edge cases can we maybe specify them explicitly in the camp. Because I noted well not quite specified and like my current understanding from looking at the implementation is, that we compile contracts contracts specifically. When we add entries to the backet P can be Iden to the backet list specifically after running each and every transaction in The Ledger it's also SPS a weird a case where. If you have an Appo transaction and the transactions, that cost and apply this contract in the same wager or whatever is your reason. Then we basically have kind of an invocation of a contract, that does not actually appro anything. But it still won't result in a c heat so, that's right yeah yeah I guess it is something to I

[09:00] think gu this here I think it is something, that we probably need to specify more explicitly in the CAP with respect to the why said it's just, that in this particular case I don't think you can ever get the correct simulation result like again I don't know why would you do, that. But simulation will probably assume like. If you do not upload any contracts. Then your contract has been cashed like every contract your has been cashed and th is this through a next case scenario where it actually is not cashed and it's not in memory. So basically your fees and resources will be off and yeah I guess just worst pointing out in the CAP I can I can clarify the conditions I do like I think you're right in, that that's, that's a fairly Edge case. Because you would have to be simulating an execution of a contract, that wasn't present on the chain on the assumption, that maybe someone will up the same transaction set as you yeah

[10:00] I I don't know why anyone does, that. But protocol kind of has to handles this anyways sure yeah yeah and and it does it'll it'll it'll it falls back gracefully it just is going to charge you more than you expected. And then you'll transaction would fail okay. But it's a I I'll document, that in the CAP yeah yeah just yeah y else okay, that was easy one. So I guess we move on to the next one yeah it doesn't look like there are any any questions. So Dimo. If you want to get started started yeah yeah type okay yeah. So yeah C 64 it's actually the cab itself is not, that hard uation and

[11:00] implementation wise. But I guess the discussion Ser more around the requirements from what are trying to Sol here here. So for some background memos are an element of every transaction every store transaction, that are almost nonobservable by the protocol the only thing, that protocol does with transactions is well it is it has will be signed as a part of the transaction envel. But otherwise memory is just some arbitrary payload, that protocol has no concerns thinking about and it would be fine. If like it was just an arbitrary thing, that has no value attached to it maybe it's for marketing transactions or something. But it happens, that so, that exchanges are used memers from for multiaction even, though

[12:00] a currency store has soal nukes accounts, which allow single public key have huge amount of different sub accounts, that are not represented on chain. But can be marked by some integer integer identifier for historical reasons most of the exchanges are just using the transaction memers and the way it works is, that. When you want to deposit tokens from your own vet to. Then change account exchange would give you two values to consider. When making a transaction the first value is well the destination account, which is a normal store account and the second value is memo usually some integer, that is assigned to your account on, that exchange. So basically in this way can maintain only a few public is they

[13:00] don't need to create a new account for every user and for store it's actually very meaningful. Because on St there are no State less accounts like since the account is not just a public key. But literally a wer entry. So you need to create it first. So it makes perfect sense, that exchange just runs this offchain multiflection for redution the overall version for maintaining large sets of users, that's kind of the historical background. Then exchanges do use MOS For Better or Worse mied accounts are like more modern way to do, that. But not actually being used not, that much then. When tan came out it didn't care about memos for the reason mentioned before like from the

[14:00] protocal perspective on paper M do n and this actually spawn kind of a vulnerability. If anyone wanted to use mammas in the context of the exchanges with San and I think there is a security security there is post in the security sections of tore the advisory regarding this issue I probably will not talk much about it. Because like not super relevant. Because like it has been fixed and no one has been affected. But the gist of it is, that it is not possible for a custom account to sign for the transaction memo memo and what this means is, that for example imagine you wanted to deposit money to The Exchange from your customer

[15:00] account even. If exchange could take St band payments without any issues you actually have no way to sign the mem of the transaction and. If you recall the your account on Exchange your deposit deposit into to is actually combination of the some public key. So the account and a memo and yeah. When when you're making a sban transfer there is simply no way to sign for the memo and in the context of vulnerabilities, that means, that well. If you were to attach your off for the transfer to some to transaction with the memo the store transaction by definition is signed by some classic account. Because well your transfer is a thrand transfer from a custom account and unfortunately as of today it cannot sign for the whole transaction. And then anyone could

[16:00] take your San off for the transfer and attach it to a different transaction with a different member it is obviously vulnerability but. If you think about it like it is kind of unlikely, that this situation would come up in the first place. Because well as I mentioned like you literally cannot make a stun transfer is a memo. So like the whole preconditions to this situation situation I kind of you're like you need have two account both of each must be fasted and only one of them is set in memo other one is not set in memo so, that's kind of the state of the things and the way like the protocol deals with the. If you potentially shooting yourself in direct by us memers with San transactions in the exchange context, that car simply does not allow such transactions to be present in The

[17:00] Ledger they rejected before entering the the mle. But we still want to have some solution for interacting with the exchanges using the custom account and C 64 is about like the most straightforward kind of solution there is hopefully the least necessary amount of work for exp me to support. Because it uses the old ways of using memos it just makes them usable from the San point and the way it makes meem usable from the San point is very straightforward you just find as a part of your San pres payload you may set some memo, that you expect to be present in the transaction and this signs for it explicitly. When you are

[18:00] building your signature P it's basically makes it. So you actually. Now can Cree the suran transfer operation from customer account to some arbitrary exchange the account and your signature will also be a signature of your memo. And then this us payot will only be valid. If it is a part of transaction, that as a match in memo. So well you still need to have two accounts. So need to kind of trust there is no way to actually prevent the prevent there is no way to take your o, that you sign foran and attach it to a transaction with a different memo and there is basically no way to make the transfer not go where it was supposed to go and obviously the next step would

[19:00] be like. If you were to implement it I must make it clear like even. If you were to use it like there is no guarantee, that exchanges will support it. But at least in order to support, that they just need to increase the scope of the transactions, that are, that they monitoring like. Because I would imagine like on a high level okay don't have access to your code obviously. But on a high level what they would do is they would look at the intern in of transactions somehow identify the payment. And then look at the payment transaction and identify the memo is this change they need to also look at the Rob on transer operations again mattera should look the same in terms of like having the balance of the account increased. Then is in exactly the same place of the

[20:00] transaction as it for classic. So this is a CAP the payment operations to C address it is like a an opposite basically. When you think of interaction with the exchanges to operations you want to support it's are deposits and withdrawal mean deposit is I have my vet I want to send money to The Exchange. And then do some trading on the exchange and withdrawal means I have some balance token on my non noncustodial exchange account and I want to move it back to my crypto wet, that I own this is withdraw and payments to C address are actually about supporting this DS. So it is kind of related. But it's not in scope of this C and

[21:00] I'm I'm not sure like you're doing it for this protocol or we doing this all. But current CAP is specifically about the the deposits yeah. So this is basically what is proposed and there are obviously Alternatives such as like hey why not use nuk's accounts and as I mentioned L ex changes don't affort them anyway anyway. Then hey why not come up with a solution for Tran multi Flexin and again exchanges don't use it yet and it is e compling and U it probably requires much more design work and, which is no very obvious way of how to do motortion with turbance it is also meaningful. So what this C does is basically kind of fixes an immediate issue we have. But it

[22:00] does not close the doors for future modifications or coming up with the new ways of M reflection accounts and for on. But this one seem like the best thing we could do, that is like it has probably the biggest to up is the existing infrastructure UC approaches, that that are out there everything like like other solutions would be probably much more Divergent from what happens. Now and kind of releases the and adoption okay I think just it for the overview. Now this my yes Mamas and events are currently not specified by exist CAP does not

[23:00] talk about the events, which makes sense it is about mem memers. But the CAP, that we have to edit for the next week, that is two under the active discussion is about trying to generalize the events between classic and San. So meet metadata protic operations in they format, that you don't need to write custom person Logic for classic andand and may be a part of this event stream in some some Cas Cas. But yeah I don't know. If they want to discuss this. Now or not the part we have disc yeah and yes in General on more I guess the main phos

[24:00] question about this C is want not support members at all. Because they're kind of bad and people have isses SYM and I think there is some mar Just. Because of D reasons and. If other folk disagrees andbe Pi up oh in the chat maybe someone wants to camp

[25:00] on the stage may be as well call Caper still has mem in the system domain yes it's basically I would say my opinion this is, that memers do exist and they are in use for. Now for better worse and it makes sense for San to support them for the

[26:00] time being. If we have a better generic solution for, that we probably should try to come up with this separately and just try to the CRI. So my expectation is, that it will take a long time before I this P it deated to. If anyone wants to speak up maybe face. Because creting, though everyone is typing

[27:00] sounds like there's a there's more to discuss related to the the memos. But it doesn't it it should affect CAP 64 right yeah I feel like yeah they. When discussion can be contined synchronously. But before I move on like I just want to ask everyone again like. If anyone has any strong opinions in terms of why you shouldn't do CAP 64 go. Now yeah great yeah is I understand the CAP 64 as it is is very very narrow the

[28:00] the use case is it's hyper focused on addressing the existing classic use case and it's really surgical just to address the problem there is there and I understand like you know toas bring out you know why not solve this in a way way, that works for more than, that yeah and I get, that I guess my question is like there are some advantages. So even I mean obviously like. If we can solve this in a more generic way, that would be pretty cool and I we probably can. But there are also some advantages. If we do solve it really surgically. Because we sort of can rework back to the transaction memo being something, that you can rely on and

[29:00] so I think, that's valuable. But maybe, that's not valuable. So I'm not actually sure to. If you're saying, that that's actually not as valuable as what I think it's valuable or what some other of us think is valuable. If we do think, that's valuable is there anything about this proposal, that prevents us from loosening this constraint in the future like. If we go ahead with this proposal the network adops the proposal and Transaction memers what exchanges can continue to rely on in a year from now or six months from now can we loosen the requirements so, that every or can have its own memo or something like, that like is, that are we sort of going down a path where it's going to be really difficult to walk walk back right. So there are Thal things here let me start with the why don't we drop the requirement for text member to my, that transaction m I don't think it's a good idea

[30:00] because unlike the memo basically the transaction memo and You observe a successful transaction without doing any additional work you can say, that parties have all the parties have times this memo and in case of app 64 you can also say, that the Rel or par have time for this member as well. If you have a transaction, that has some s on o and there is no requirement for the memers to mat the transaction memo. When you're looking at the transaction you cannot tell anything about the nature of this payLo. Because like besides like minor space optimization I think the main conten this comes up in is ay why don't we use it for to allow something like payments to multiple multiple ex destinations at

[31:00] once in the same transaction well the issue is is, that. If you keep relying on the the transaction like in case of memos you actually don't have any confidence for any given us the it has been used and the member has actually made the P go through. And so on. So basically you put a lot more Demand on find all, that pieces of data together Downstream system. So not only do they need to jump from the event to the transaction. But they also need to make sure, that there are events for every us present in the transaction and everything matches it inst nothing basically yeah there is no extra P or something and I think it's really food guy and like. If

[32:00] someone forgets about this tck and they can be tricked into thinking, that something has been transferred to them by attaching an extra entry of tbos with some extra memo maybe you know might as a destination account of some methods in there something. So basically it is like given, that s us is really flexible. Because like really it has to support custom accounts and you do not verify it beforehand you can only verify it during the execution actually been consumed I don't think it's a good idea to just put memo in there without any size to the actual transaction. But so here basically like the fact, that the T the transaction M ures the fact, that like there is no ambiguities there in terms of like

[33:00] memers are actually getting and I recognize it's really restrictive. But I think it's also for the better for. Now and for a more General solution I think it should have something to do this day event, that you don't need to do any work Downstream trying to figure out like. If this is the right memo right M reflection ad for this particular event I think instead event should explicitly tell what is this mul ID, that confirms this particular event and I think this is why this whole discussion about the events have turned up. Because like. If you were to come up with solution, that is event based. Then it will probably make sense to also involve the current members the events to just keep the scem across all the different types of operations okay

[34:00] now I need to read the comments again and yeah I think. If yeah to the question. If we can relax this requirement I like given the security implications I not sure it is a good idea. But again just said I'm not sure it's a good idea in I think you need a bit PR approach unless of course we figure out how to TI The Memo from the ask and to the event and the sure it is possible at all

[35:00] so. If a question about like centralized exchanges would need to make some code changes either without change we is, that without, that memo change we actually basically some sort of M support is a requirement to support deposits like it's not the only thing to do. But it is a requirement. Because if they can of do multiflection I think it is very far to ask them to create an actual physical account for every user and accable for the network well. So basically like. If you don't propose any multiaction solution at all I

[36:00] think there is no way to ask ches to implement anything we need this something and the the argument for this CAP is, that well this Fon is very close to what they already doing whereas. If you try to come up with some another more General system, that's also contingent and adapting. So this whole system whatever it is I don't know yet, that's what it is is e

[37:00] going ont try some context like a recter may have been some discussion here on Discord about supporting mixed accounts

[38:00] in San in general general and the trickiest thing about any sort of multile seran and the reason for why we are not like coming in with some maybe more generic multilex app you're not coming out with one yet is, that since in sban you kind of manage your own storage it is pry to distinguish between cases. When you do care about multiflection and you don't care about mation for example consider a classic mixed account let's say you have a transfer let's say we just add it to the thron address well. When you throw the balance in your for example in your custom tokens for Multiplex account. Then you specifically want all the multi account for the for time there the same

[39:00] key but. When you're in an event you specifically want the event to cons to contain the multiplex account destination and. When you verifying us you also want to make sure, that you're sending, that the transfer happen to the exact Multiplex account, that has been specified in the transaction and I'm going not show you there a generic way of basically for for the contract developer to be aware of like. When they should or shouldn't treat accounts as multilex and this is the primary reason why like mix accounts are not supported by San by turban at all today and also is a reason for why like there's no great solution for Mar collection in foran yet. But think function, that is

[40:00] not doing anything the contract player maybe. But again I'm not sure yet how would this work like there another argument for why we have doing something simpler. So right I think. If like do we have anying topics, that need to be discussed now. Because I guess we can continue as the man Horizon discussion I think hly yeah I'll leave a link to the discussion

[41:00] the chat and we can continue there. But it doesn't sound like there are any more immediate questions for CAP 64 at the moment moment yeah. So HP yeah yeah let to force I I've expressed my opinion we can continue discussion the discussion, that. If some yeah we can continue discussing. And then, that thread and sounds like, that's it for for today. So thanks gr and Dima for presenting and thanks everyone for listening we'll see you next week unless Le George have any questions. So typing

[42:00] all right, that's it. Then see you next week
