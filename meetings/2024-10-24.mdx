The SDF Platform team held an internal hackathon last week to build applications that use the Composable Data Platform (CDP). In this week's developer meeting, team members presented their projects. The apps varied widely (trading app, fraud detection, JS browser-based ingestor, etc.), with the goal of showing how easy it is to use CDP.

### Key Topics

- Trading aggregation service built on CDP data streams
- Fraud detection using CDP (`Deceptiscan`)
- Multiple CDP “hackies,” including:
  - General data indexers and payments indexers
  - Smart contract expiration alerts
  - Data indexes stored in DuckDB
  - Torrent-based distribution for data indexes
  - Ledger metadata extraction
- JavaScript, browser-based data ingestion frontend
- Real-time analytics pipelines and dashboards
- Developer discussion on ease of setup, flexibility, and experimentation with CDP
