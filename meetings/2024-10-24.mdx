The SDF Platform team held an internal hackathon last week to build applications that use the [Composable Data Platform (CDP)](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/composable-data-platform). In this week's developer meeting, team members presented their projects. The apps varied widely (trading app, fraud detection, JS browser-based ingestor, etc.), with the goal of showing how easy it is to use CDP.

Projects presented in the meeting:

1. Trading Aggregations Service
2. Deceptiscan: CDP fraud detection
3. Composable Data Platform hackies: data indexer, payments indexer, contract expiration alerts, data indexes in DuckDB, torrents for data indexes, and ledger metadata
4. JS frontend data ingestion
5. Real-time analytics
