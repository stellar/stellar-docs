- foreign [Music] welcome to the stellar open protocol discussion uh in these meetings we discuss core advancement proposals aka caps these are technical specs that suggest changes to the stellar protocol necessary to allow that protocol to continue to evolve to meet ecosystem needs we live stream these meetings so that anyone who is interested can follow along i do want to note it's a technical discussion so if you're watching you should take a look at the cap we're planning to discuss which is linked to in the show description it's cap 38.
- also we do keep an eye on the discussion box and your comments there they do help inform our decisions um that said today's discussion focuses on reviewing final changes to a cap that's already been approved and our goal is to acknowledge and validate those exchanges so you know we'll again pay attention to that discussion box and if relevant questions come in we may try to incorporate them but we do have this very specific goal as i said today's discussion focuses on a single cap cap 38 and this meeting is basically the end of its life cycle that life cycle started with the discussion on the stellar dev mailing list and there's a link to that mailing list in the event description for anyone interested in joining and participating in future discussions um after that discussion the cap was drafted and then iterated on based on feedback and suggestions that came in and once it's settled it was approved by the cap committee entered into a one-week final comment period and then it got through that period it was implemented in a major stellar core release it is now officially part of protocol 18.

With Protocol 18 ready for a validator vote, this call reviewed the final tweaks to CAP-0038 (the AMM proposal that ultimately shipped). The team revisited every outstanding change request—authority revocation, limit enforcement, result codes, and rounding behavior—to make sure the merged implementation behaved just like offers on the orderbook.

Key discussion threads:

- Aligning pool operations with offer semantics: liquidity providers must always be able to withdraw shares, even if their trustline becomes unauthorized, and deposits/withdrawals now emit clearer result codes when slippage or limits are hit.
- Guardrails for issuer actions: when assets are revoked, pool positions unwind predictably and cannot get stuck in “unwithdrawable” states, even if a price swings violently between the deposit and redemption.
- Pre-flight reminders for builders: install Protocol-18-compatible releases of Stellar Core, Horizon, and the SDKs before the November 3 validator vote, because the AMM functionality includes breaking changes across the stack.
