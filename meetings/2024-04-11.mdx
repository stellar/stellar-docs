This session focused on a draft proposal to standardize the Stellar wallet interface, led by Piyal from the Freighter team. The goal of the discussion was to gather ecosystem feedback on the scope, assumptions, and practical implications of introducing a common interface for wallets.

Participants explored where the proposed standard fits within the broader ecosystem, how it interacts with existing tooling like Stellar Wallet Kit, and whether the current design appropriately accounts for different wallet environments such as browser extensions, mobile wallets, and WalletConnect-based integrations.

### Key Topics

- Overview of the [draft proposal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/83191be659166e05f8df1257c6f655de9d1afe63/ecosystem/sep-0043.md) for wallet interface standard (SEP-43)
- Feedback on design assumptions:
  - Questioning whether requiring the network passphrase adds unnecessary complexity
- Wallet ecosystem coverage:
  - Recognition that browser extension wallets, mobile wallets, and WalletConnect-based wallets have significantly different requirements
  - Suggestion that mobile and WalletConnect integrations may need separate SEPs, ideally authored by teams building for those platforms
- Role of shared tooling:
  - Discussion on how [Stellar Wallet Kit](https://stellarwalletskit.dev) fits into the ecosystem and how it should interact with or depend on the proposed standard
- Next steps:
  - Incorporating ecosystem feedback into revisions of the proposal
  - Continuing discussion via GitHub to refine scope and requirements
