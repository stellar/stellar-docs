In this special edition of the weekly Stellar Developer Meeting, the Ecosystem DevRel team met in person during an offsite to reflect on the past year and share what they’re focused on next. The conversation emphasized how Soroban’s first year on mainnet, improved onboarding tooling, and stronger ecosystem visibility have reshaped what it feels like to build on Stellar.

The team also discussed practical priorities for the year ahead—growing developer adoption, increasing on-chain activity, and making core tools easier to use through better docs and educational content. Several “fun-first” experiments (like on-chain games) were highlighted as a way to drive engagement while still teaching real Soroban patterns.

### Key Topics

- Team introductions and highlights from the past year (Soroban launch, Meridian, ecosystem momentum)
- Documentation efforts to move and expand Soroban docs within the main Stellar documentation site
- Focus metrics for the year: growing monthly active developers and increasing daily contract invocations
- Using Dune analytics to track Soroban activity and interpreting spikes driven by “fun” on-chain experiments
- How lowering friction with tooling can drive usage:
  - `LaunchTube` enabling fee sponsorship and simplifying transaction submission on mainnet
  - Passkeys and smart wallets enabling smoother onboarding and signing with biometrics
- Plans to make adoption easier via clearer documentation, guides, and examples around key tooling (Passkeys, `LaunchTube`, smart wallets)
- Interest in expanding “playful” ecosystem apps (games/activations) as educational demos and catalysts for chain activity
- Discussion of fine-grained permissions and automation ideas:
  - Policy signers + bots/agents for safe delegation (e.g., automating repetitive DeFi actions)
- Ecosystem reflections:
  - DeFi growth and visibility improvements (e.g., making Stellar/Soroban activity more accurately represented on major dashboards)
  - Supporting builders through mentorship/incubator-style programs and helping new teams ship quickly
- Community Q&A topics:
  - Upcoming event activations (teased)
  - Dev meetings being uploaded and organized via a YouTube playlist
  - Core team engagement primarily via Discord for discussions and feedback

[00:00] Maybe with, that box a little bit this way I don't it makes much difference. But okay hello everyone this is a very special edition of our weekly meeting with me today I have the entire deal team. So hello and to kick it off I'll hand it over to Nicole hello everyone I'm. So excited to be here with the entire deil team we are in San Francisco having a deil offsite and talking about all the really cool fun stuff we have planned for this year. And so we thought. While we're here all together we should you know get together on this call and say hi to everybody introduce ourselves probably and talk about a couple of things we really loved last year and some of the things we're excited about this year. So I'm really excited to

[01:00] here and I'm excited to have everybody here with us let me see I guess I'll kick it off. So hi everyone I am Nicole I am the manager of the deal team I've been here for almost two years at SCF and I guess let me start with what I loved about last year. And then I'm going to go around and let everybody else introduce themselves. But last year two highlights for me were Protocol 20 soron sorry nobody else can take, that and Meridian ha Meridian were really awesome it was really cool and fun to just be there and like see builders and see all the amazing projects, that came out over like 24 hours and it was really awesome. So I'm going to go this way to LA

[02:00] hello everybody I'm Elliot I'm your friend I'm. So excited just to be aart I've been around Stellar for like a long time and I still just feel. So lucky, that I get to do this like for work and it's amazing one of the things, that there's what we are excited to do also not yet yeah

[03:00] saying it's frozen dead for me we're Frozen oh yeah the frame rate looks kind of janky can you hear us weird okay they said we're back okay yeah the all right nice are yes monitor yeah I'll just do this the whole time okay. So they did see me waving all right oh they want to zoom in I don't know how to do, that we can do, that control camera frame people we're experimenting live really bad hey you don't know how these cameras work real tight on Ty yeah hey

[04:00] everybody I'll move to like whoever's talking. If you just let it do this thing all right let me braing people okay Elliot are you done yeah I'm done sorry okay go ahead okay hi everybody my name is Bri wild I'm a writer on the deil team I've been around for three years and I love it here very much I know Nicole took the Sor Bond launching, which is a very exciting thing. But so one thing, that we did last year, that was it's not very glamorous or fun. But we Elliot and I worked a lot on bringing the soron documentation to the Stellar documentation site. So lots of docs work. And then making sure everything is yeah updated in the documentation or yeah soron being on

[05:00] Stellar and something, that I really enjoyed is kale so. If you all are not farming kale you should be and yeah, that's probably like one of the most fun things, that we've done she's just saying after she's on my lead board I Am Number 10 on the leaderboard. So she do address so, that's, that's it for me. So hey everyone I am Chris natalo last year I escaped the Ethereum EVM ecosystem and joined Stellar in July and yeah definitely not looking back I am biased. But the community here is like way more authentic way more legit. If if you go to like most Solana or Ethereum discords people are asking. When air drop you know. But in the Stellar

[06:00] ecosystem people are like really helping each other people are building real things people are just really excited about like actually authentically you know building on the ecosystem so, that's a really awesome change for me I guess like last year I think one of the things was like putting Stellar back like on the map you know we had big presents at a lot of major events like Decon and people are talking about Stellar and yeah we were getting a lot of exposure on the like in media in the crypto Twitter sphere yeah just see lots of great activity around Stellar you know with we actually just fixed fa it is working again we're actually at the dev offsite right. Now talking about. When she

[07:00] C 2.0 we will let you know soon. But yeah just thank you all for being a part of the community and yeah my name is Carsten; I'm a developer advocate in the dev team and I joined in July last year and I would say the one reason I joined was San. But at least, that was why I got super interested in Stellar I think adding smart contracts just made a huge difference for me it was all of a sudden a really interesting chain you could build whatever you wanted the sky was a limit. So I thought, that was a really interesting time to join I love to see what developers are building I love to help them in any way I can Meridian was a is was super exciting last year getting to meet a lot of the developers yeah lots of interesting talks it was

[08:00] super great experience to network with a lot of the builders on and San yeah Tyler hello everyone I'm Tyler I'm also a developer advocate here I've been here for five years last year a highlight for me was kind of well we knew pretty early on, that we wanted to add the SE p256 R1 signing curve, which doesn't mean anything to really anybody unless you maybe a little bit more Technical and understand like, that's, that's what the signing curve, that's used in for p keys. But taking, that like journey of super technical all the way through to. Now you can sign transactions with your face or your fingerprint and having to build all the technology to facilitate, that happening, that was a huge highlight for me I've also I have a long history on trying to give people XLM and it's very hard to do

[09:00] without having to go through a whole long process of kyc and collecting tax stocks and like I just want to give away XLM and let people play games and launch tube was a huge I mean it kind of killed two birds. When we don't kill birds it what did we say fed two birds with one seed where we can with a launch tube token I can give away a launch tube token without having to do any YC let me do any tax do collection and allows developers to submit transactions on Main net using the XLM, that's held within, that launch tube token. Because they can't go and farm those XLM out of, that launch tube token and take it and do nefarious things, which is why we have to do kyc and collect tax stocks and, that is awesome. But then also there's the problem of. When you actually want to do something on mainnet yeah you got to like source XLM to pay those fees and it's like students on sell is really cheap. But you still need

[10:00] to have, that XLM. So it doesn't really matter how cheap it is. If you have to like create a coinbase account or a binance account and figure out a way to like connect your bank. And then you got to wait and, that Journey from I want to go to mainnet to actually being able to do, that is pretty tricky until you introduce something like launch, which basically lets you get transactions on chain for free and it handles all of the coordination of paying the feed simulating the transaction super neat Service was really excited to get, that online last year and it's kind of been something, that I've been trying to press and work towards for a long time. So those are definitely two big highlights for me from last year awesome all right what about this year I get to go first, which means I get to take the best ones. But no I. So this year we have a ton of you know I plans and ideas and we're g to share

[11:00] them as like they develop. But I think like for me as we're at this offsite as we're thinking as we're making some of those plans I'm really excited, that like this is the first year obviously, that we're starting off with smart contracts on Stellar like obviously we had all of last year. But like we can hit the ground running this year with smart contracts and there's a lot of really fun stuff I think we can do and, that we want to do and, that we're planning to do and I think I am GNA share my screen. Because that we're looking for, that we're

[12:00] check can you hear us audio back my check all right. So it's all right I stop talking confirmed can you hear me all right let's just keep it here we'll share, that link got it yeah okay. So yes his audio goes with me screen share okay big takeaway more monthly active devs coming in sticking around, that is one of our big numbers number go up and I think it's really

[13:00] exciting. So number one Tyler number two yeah the other number, that we're trying to press up to the roof is daily contract invocations I think I can share a link since I'm not going to be able to maybe screen share yeah can we can't do waiting is, that one right there. So there's a dune analytics this is the graph, that I'm most interested this next year is pushing his daily contract invocations off I want to see Soroban be very active there's a lot of different ways to do, that there's a lot of reasons, that you may want, that to happen. But the technolog is awesome and. If you're looking at, that graph you can kind of see, that it hasn't been used a whole lot I mean we're hitting an average maybe before November of about 2,000 or. So invocations per day, which isn't terrible. But it's certainly

[14:00] there's a lot of room to grow there. And then you can see this massive Spike, that happens in November December so, that triggers off. When Enrique launched his fcm proof of work contract, that I think was one of the first like fun things goofy things to do on Soroban, that to me really pointed to this punch of. If you introduce some fun things to do on. So not just the serious grownup blockchain things. But just fun things to do goofy things with stories and lore and what not, that you can actually get a lot of activity. And so I also built a improve of work asset, that addressed some of fcms just had a different philosophy of how to grow and introduce people to the platform and, that's where these numbers really start to take off where you have a minor, that you could use the CLI for, that's kind of, that first time. And then I introduce the website for

[15:00] farming kale and it just kind of goes through the roof you can see it's starting to taper off. Now these fun activations often have a pretty short life cycle where they Spike up people have fun. And then they're ready for the next thing I've likened it to kind of like going on vacation or going to a water park like you're not going to stay there for the rest of your life you're going to go there you're gonna have fun. And then you're gonna be done and you're going to go home. And then you'll do something fun another day, that's sort of kind of things, that I like to work on are flashes in the pan lightning in a bottle you work on something, that's fun see what works what doesn't. Then you iterate work on something else. So I definitely am working on my next big idea to try and keep pushing these numbers up and I kind of my challenge to the developer ecosystem is to also think of fun things to do on chain and make 2025 a year where we're really trying to push up these daily contract invocations, which make the chain look very active and

[16:00] engaged so. When you combine those two things of monthly active devs and daily contract invocations those are really good numbers those are numbers, that will attract more and more attention activity beets more attention and activity. So combining those two things together I think will help us win over other change, that maybe. When you start to dig into the ecosystem a little bit more and you do want to begin to do more serious things it's quite hard to do. Because the those relationships haven't been built with traditional web to technology or traditional Finance we've solved, that problem. But we need to solve the attraction developer attention and just getting developers to build stuff on chain. So there's lots of great things you can do, and now we just need to bring the attentional build the water part as it were one little fun side I can't share my screen. So I can't share, that one. But I think it is really fascinating on this particular graph it says, that 1.5 almost 1.5 total smart

[17:00] contract invocations 43% of those came from launch tube. So almost half of all of our smart contract invocations went through launch tube, which to me again is pointing to this idea, that. When you make it really easy for people to submit transactions on chain without having to fiddle with XLM, that combined with the smart wallets where you don't have to download anything you know there 24w passphrase and all this sense and you can just click a button and you're on you get a lot of users like kale has only been around for a. While it's also like what are we supposed to do with this game like it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. But people love to play it make something, that's maybe you know a little bit more interesting this number will just continue to go up and up. Because we have these tools like the pass key kit smart wallets and launch tube we're getting on chain and doing something on chain is very easy for users. So now, that we have those tools in

[18:00] place it's time to build. So we just need to build fun things sweet awesome. So monthly active devs invitations per day those are our two main goals as a team again I'm really excited about the fact, that we can hit the ground running in this like new exciting way and, that we've got all these resources these you know tools, that Tyler's built, that can like extrapolate out from build upon as a team and as an ecos in general what is everybody else excited about. So a lot of developers tend to have brilliant and creative ideas and my strategy is to wait for them to do, that. And then snatch it. So Tyler has done a lot of really cool stuff or a lot of really amazing tools and projects and just really creative and Innovative things and my plan very soon is to try and break some

[19:00] of those things I'm going to build some projects on not like on his I'm gonna break my own duplicate or modify or build on top of the things, that he's building like a taale marketplace where you can exchange different produces maybe depending on how much you're willing to stake different invokers contracts for, that kind of stuff and just generally having fun messing around with the things, that he built and trying to show other people how they can do it too sweet awesome I can go next oh Carson go ahead guys I'm actually going to talk a little bit to what Elliot said and what Tyler said. Because I think for Elliott to become successful in Building Things based on launch tube keys and all these things just like any other

[20:00] developer I'm sure he would appreciate a lot of good documentation showing how to use all these great tools and, that's something, that I'm excited about taking some of the really cool ideas and cool projects Pass key is a game changer in my opinion. But we need to make it easy for developers to adopt, that also OT. So it's easier for him to do all his fun projects you can just go and read the documentation. So so, that's, that's actually something I'm really excited about getting these Technologies more accessible for developers make it easier make their adoption time faster they we need to get these brilliant ideas out there and have them used by developers they should not just end up in a repo somewhere they need to get out and get to work so, that's what I'm excited about, that I can take some of the ideas, that Tyler has and some of the projects he's built and

[21:00] document, that and show develop us how they can do something similar and hopefully, that'll Inspire them to build something different. But maybe based on some of these ideas. So so yeah I just felt it was kind of a little bit natural to jump in here perfect cool yeah. So I'll good next yeah. So yeah I feel like the outfit in the room for all of web 3 has always been self- cust is a non-starter for most users it's too complex you know honestly passwords aren't secure you know the number one password is one two three four five six seven you know. So pass keys are a game changer you know and all the major companies are using it are implementing pass Keys you know GitHub Google you know. So once you lower this onboarding friction people are going to start coming into it you know and. If and once you lower the development friction

[22:00] people are going to start building you know. So with pass Keys kit with launch tube with all these amazing tools, that are facilitating and enabling developers to build it's going to unleash the floodgates and what's going to come through those floodgates I think it's gonna be a lot of DeFi protocols you know like some people say TBL is kind of a vity metric. But honestly I think in web 3 DeFi is going to enable whole new business models right we for instance in web 2 the only two ways you monetize are ads and cers. So like once you have DeFi as a foundation you enable all of these new amazing use cases on Stellar and, that's, that's really what it's all about you know is just like unleashing the creativity of the developer work for us and just

[23:00] seeing what you guys build you know I'm just like super excited to see like what do things new models new paradigms people build built on DeFi built on chain just totally changing the game you know. Because Stellar has you know a lot going for it's super fast it's super cheap and it's where blockchain it's the real world our audit offer ecosystem is you know way better than any other G. So like yeah I'm just super excited to see what people build I can't wait once we put these tools in your hands and you guys build some magicw excitement excited for Bri a lot of things I guess I'm really excited to bring yeah just like I'm a writer. So bringing

[24:00] awareness to all the really cool things, that all these amazing people are building in this room and also the ecosystem as well I did write a piece on blend recently, that was really fun. So talking about yeah talking about projects and how projects are working together and putting together blog pieces to kind of bring awareness to the really cool things, that are being done is what I'm really excited about and hopefully continuing to kale lure. Because I'm obsessed kale and I just write more. So yeah Tyler I think you already said what you were excited about right yeah I mean I'm excited to see the daily invocations go up I really want to see a pass key a smart wallet get like an actual interface get audited like we're using them on Main net and we're holding pale in them. But I want to see one of these

[25:00] actually get audited and get much wider use I want to see a lot of fun things to do on chain, that are orbiting around these pasy wallets where there's an ecosystem, that kind of grows up, that knows has buil some standards around how to interoperate between websites like pesis are not terribly intuitive to figure out how to share them. So we'll need some coordination and standards. But I think you know 2025 is the year the G address dies and the C address reign supreme it's not everyone agrees with me. But they're wrong. Because address is going to take over the world and I'm here for it all right well, that's prediction. So all right another thing we thought we might do just as a team in the same room is you know we are very close I think we're like a month and a couple

[26:00] days from the anniversary of svon a net. And so we thought we would you know either share a favorite story from the last year cool development you know projects, that were awesome, that we saw come into the ecosystem who would like to start I won't take the first one. So I you know whoever submitted, that first transaction on inter they, that was. So fun and smart of them to do, that I wonder who, that was I just thought they, that was amazing I mean within literal seconds, that it closed it's like they really worked hard to prepare for, that moment for, that to happen and had waited for many years for smart contract. So I don't know you know who, that was. But tudos to them for working and doing, that and putting a little poem on chain is the first

[27:00] transaction you know it's funny. Because Tyler really likes to be first really liked it sometimes he's not first, though and it's really fun, that is like the most fun. When he comes in second you know please yes what will we share oh favorite Memories the other thing, that I think was really cool was blend launching. Because I've followed their story. So closely since way back. When we were doing Turrets and we were using JavaScript VMS as like an L2 to try and figure out a way to do smart things on Stellar. And so following their Journey from really. When I first joined as a contractor at SDF way back. When they had found Stellar and were trying to figure out how to do some of their advanced stuff they were still like in college and super smart. But trying to like figure out to do what they wanted to do on Stellar. And then working

[28:00] through with the turret smart contract protocol. And then actually building a smart contract protocol and convincing the network, that we needed it and, that we should build it. And then working through to actually see, that go onto Main net. And then seeing blend launch on mainnet and people actually using it, and now there's tvl there, that narrative kind of seeing, that come all the way full circle and go live after just years and years of watching, that team and working with, that team, that was a really cool moment for me awesome everyone else stories favorites from last year one year of Sor bom I think I can something, that I think is has been a really good experience is, that we have worked with an incubator in collaboration with cell Community Fund and Ru and

[29:00] a couple of us have been a mentor for some of these teams and see them come in some of them not having any experience writing smart contracts they had an idea they had something, that they thought they could build and in a matter of in some cases days. But in a couple of weeks some of them have the first smart contracts up and running they building they're really enthusiastic and I think. When you consider, that soran is not even one year old, that we had the documentation we had sample code I think, that's we can't give the team, that worked on San enough credit for, that I think a lot of other cases it takes years to build out documentation sample code have a support system and being able to really do something substantial and I

[30:00] think I think U I came in later I can't take any credit for, that. But I just think it's amazing to see developers get up and running writing smart contracts deploying their contracts to test net and to main, that within few days after the first time they ever get to know about soran. So so I think, that's a really cool thing and I think I have a lot of appreciation for all the work, that went into, that up to the launch of soran yeah, that's awesome yeah I think a big narrative for last year was the onchain effect. So having narratives. If you're familiar with the story basically there's an entrepreneur who was in San Francisco Columbia, that was able to extend opportunity to be a remote personal assisted to people, that live in a cash

[31:00] only Village and they were able to basically hold their Savings in stablecoins on Stellar and get money out through money graah via our integration in their local currency and, that was like a narrative U, that I saw like repeated on you know on LinkedIn on Twitter by non web3 people I saw people on Web Two In traditional Tech even not tech people like Echo the story, that just makes sense normal people you know it's like it's a story you could tell Grandma to you can tell to Grandma over the Thanksgiving table, that you'll understand. So like seeing a A Narrative of story, that actually resonates with the like non crypto people it like shows a real use case like this is what you can do on chain, that was an amazing story and it was only possible on Stellar, that was one of the big highlights for me last here for just seeing the real potential of crypto

[32:00] other than meem coins you know other than PP do fund not, that there's anything wrong with Bean points you know fun is fun people love fun. But yeah okay I guess like one thing, that's been really fun as I've just like been able to write about Soroban is kind of why sorond developers have made certain decisions such as like State exploration and you know how metering works for fees and, that sort of thing and just kind of how the platform is being built for sustainability and learning from the experiences of like other networks has been really cool to learn about and gives me a lot of faith and you know I just really think, that our I don't know, that the developers are amazing, that I've built the platform and making these

[33:00] kind of hard decisions and talking about it has been really fun and interesting to see and also really fun and interesting to write about. So yeah, that's awesome I mean I feel like I'm just gonna Echo what everybody else is saying. But like you know it was I feel like there was there were moments of kind of crystallization of these things like half Meridian everybody who was there sat in, that room and didn't sleep and made stuff, that was really awesome overnight and you know like I mean I just think it was really awesome to see you know we had a lot of the team present on pass keys and kind of run through workshops. And then you know have P Tyler's pasky kit and have a lot of these teams kind of take, that and build things like by the next day and, that was really awesome. And so you know as far as being a soron

[34:00] narrative, that was pretty cool. So one of the things I've had my hand in over the last year is trying to get Stellar's representation on places like DeFi Lama and coin gecko like more prominent and more reflective of what actually is happening on the network and. If you look at like art tvl perhaps a vanity metric perhaps not. But it shows like at least the utilization to some degree of what people are putting onto the network. If you look at def llama's tvl Soroban went main net on February 20th and at, that time our tvl was like right around eight million or. So and a week later it doubles like overnight to 16 17 million, and now we're like at 60 million just like obviously smart contracts or something, that the community was hungry for and we listened

[35:00] and we did the thing and like surprisingly people are using it oh my gosh they said they wanted to use it and they're gonna actually use it who knew it's just. So exciting to see it like all the work, that we put into it validated and actually going to like use cases going to do things, that people are going to take advantage of and use yeah and yeah it's awesome and like. When we say to it's like the entire ecosystem you know like I mean. But so crucially it's awesome all right we had a question about eth Denver I don't want to scoop anybody. So this isn't GNA be an announcement. But there will be something really fun at e Denver this year is what I will say and I think somebody did share the link it may involve cards there was chips yeah poker

[36:00] game was shared on the build on Stellar Twitter I don't know how to interpret risk level shark infested, that's I don't know. But details dropping soon. So stay tuned we are not gonna scoop anybody right. Now are the sh gonna have lasers stayed we're not sure yet and yeah I mean I think we can maybe take some questions from chat. If there are questions other questions or comments or things, that people are thinking about or things, that you want to see or things you want to do in the ecosystem let us know or. If you need an address to send all your tokens to oh the do B do

[37:00] B yeah I don't know I mean well I guess like what does everybody think about Dev do Don Bri is going on a very committed maybe, that's a strong we'll have to see no I mean like I loved running the dock found it was good it's yeah it's a good way to get documentation and get community and ecosystem involvement so, which is are all wonderful things. But it's there is much overhead for administering a program like, that what will Tyler Tinker with next yeah, that's a good question after pasy aren't the hot thing anymore are they gonna paskis are always goody yeah heard of AI

[38:00] agents I might be tinkering with, that I like AI a lot and I did a coding with kale just talked about this anything. But AI on AI agents yeah anything. But AI agent yep sorry Mattias why Tyler why am I gonna work on AI. Because Matias doesn't want me to right I have a life mission AI agents. Because I really like the idea of making Bots, that can do things for me so, that I don't have to this particularly with like blend here's my I here's my use case for what I'm trying to pursue I like blend a lot I really don't like claiming my emissions or rebalancing between the different fols. So I want to build a bot, that will handle all of, that for me by

[39:00] reading inbound transactions or like reading the current state of all the pools reading the current state of my balances in the emissions pools seeing. If it's time to try and move between different pools. But I don't want to have to like manually do any of, that. And so I want to build an AI agent, that can handle all, that for me so. When you combine things like the smart wallets with the policy designers and AI agents I think you can pretty easily build some tools, that are in this case custom built to blend. But would be pretty easy to customize for a bunch of different contracts you can think of I don't know kale or whatever where you could chat with it or you could just send it into some sort of Cron job where the prompts are data, that's being fit in. So an AI prompt doesn't have to be like written English it can be like Json files or. If you've got a parser right it could be a meta from a

[40:00] transaction, that could. Then feed into some sort of outcome like rebalancing or filling orders I mean there's. So many interesting things, that could happen. When you combine these smart wallets, which. Now you don't have to like have a human involved in signing things with policy signers. So you don't have to worry about giving too much permission to some third party service you can very tight bound what they're allowed to do only claim emmissions only for me only on the blend protocol only for a certain amount of money in a certain period of time give, that to an AI agent, that can. Then interpret those rules know its limitations and start to act on those rules for the benefit of the user, that type of stuff's really interesting to me it's a lot of experimentation but, that's Sly something I'm interested in working on. And then just more kale type of games. So I've got one of those, that I'm working on right. Now hopefully it'll be here sometime in quarter one

[41:00] we'll see you have another question how do you feel about well apparently according to StellarExpert. If you hold just the tiniest amount of kale you're a billionaire. So you could show her, that look at all the M all the money we've made I'm still waiting for someone to actually start Market making between like fcm and kale or to create a whole separate Farmers Market I want someone to make a farmers market. Because that's. So funny. Because we have like dexes and market makers and AMM and all of these things like what's the most fundamental base Market you could have from the dawn of time like a farmers market where I can sell my kale for chickens or ve other vegetables or coffee or you know someone's bead work

[42:00] it's just asking to be turned into some sort of farmers market game. So should do, that. And then your imagination can run wild. Because we've also you know like we've been throwing around ideas, that would be really cool to see like we have a farmers's market could you pick up ingredients for you know really nice suit or I don't know the best kind of suit virtual suit yeah exactly kale soup you know yeah I've been trying to convince Tyler, that like Leaf Kale like real kale is delicious is a disgusting vegetable and only for digital representation farming future contract somebody should make a Marketplace and somebody should make recipes for kale and other vegetables kale soup stand

[43:00] how yeah I think Al building all, that like Marketplace it's a lot of fun it's fun to play with but. If we break it down we could actually spin off a lot of cool sample projects to show how this is built and I think there's a lot of educational value in doing something like this it sounds super fun and it's like just having a good time here. But but there's actually a lot of learning, that goes into building something like, that we can, pass on to the community. So I think even, though it sounds like fun and crazy ideas, that there's a lot of learning in it and there's a lot of knowledge to be extracted from, that and I think, that's, that's, that's going to be one of our big jobs in 2025 is to take all these fun ideas and actually turn it into a knowledge and educational content. So it's not just fun all of it's there's a meaning to all this we have talked a lot about doing fun stuff

[44:00] doing fun games doing fun in educational stuff and it's a it's learning should be fun yeah it's a great Point like the kale contract along with the fcm contract like there's actually a lot of really good learnings in there I mean I spent a lot of time. When I was writing, that contract to make it really efficient. So there are a lot of like very technical decisions, that I made in order to keep the cost of using kale low so, that it wouldn't overwhelm the network and drive up the cost of a lot of stuff. But it could be this thing, that could scale could get a lot of traction. But wouldn't affect the bottom line of the network too much. So there actually a lot of stuff in there, that could be really useful for anybody building contracts to employ into maybe more serious use cases good thing to note yeah other

[45:00] questions collaborations with other community nonprofits or Dows I feel like it maybe a little bit more on the ecosystem growth side yeah we did partner with funding the comments, which is a big D for public kids yeah. But definitely more of an question. But yeah there are future plans yeah any other questions or ideas by the way yeah any spicy questions what other jalapeno, that's not a hot pepper like green pepper green grepper pale question

[46:00] the hot take speed round I already gave mine g addresses aios am mikos the year of the SE address J all growing in 2025 stay tuned see we can't answer anything it's. So [Laughter] boring you don't ask for question one more question where's the alpha oh you want some Alpha oh stay tuned on I already dropped, that we're going to be working on another fun I think they're working on docs V3

[47:00] mer oh my gosh we're going to delete the docks everything's gonna be AI generated there's gonna be this automated person, that talks to you and answers all your questions all live, that would be wild, though like you go to a doc site this is a person, that like talks to you answers your questions hi my name is what's, that Iron Man the Iron Man character, that Jarvis hi I'm Jarvis how can I help you build sorond contract this is one for the year of the C address could it be helpful for contracts to interact with the DEX it could be helpful I don't know what the team is thinking about like the G Toc compatibility question of gry how do those things interact there's lots of debate between the current ecosystem with G addresses and the new growing ecosystem with C addresses it's a good question. But I don't think there's a whole lot of answers here yet until we

[48:00] start to see how the ecosystem adapts to Smart wallets policy signers DeFi where the liquidity goes how different markets pop up, that maybe either take the place of the deck or move faster than the deck there's definitely a lot of inter like you got toor on one side saying we're going to remove the DEX you've got people on the other side saying the deck is the and will never go away. So lots of outstanding questions and ideas and can't just I don't know you can't just remove stuff there has to be better things to put in this place and, that just takes time to develop and do the research for and see who your partners will be who would Implement those things and can help with the design and the implementation and use cases and the wallets. So it's never been a better time to build. But there's also a lot of outstanding questions for what the future actually looks like questions about the future where is

[49:00] Meridian G to [Laughter] [Laughter] be what team you think we're on, that's not our team well I don't know there. If there are there is one more question speed yeah I'm not sure about the status on, that I know they're still talking about speedex types of Technology. But I'm not sure where they currently are it's not where I spend my time. So I'm not sure there's still research happening towards it I think I do know, that I don't think it's speedex related. But there are some CAPs, that they've got open for like the next upcoming protocol releases and I think they're planning on doing some of those meetings on Discord. So and. Then I'm not sure. If it'll be on stream to Twitch as well. But keep an eye out for some of those it's a great place to kind of see where the core team is thinking

[50:00] about some of these types of questions of where are we goingon to go next what updates do we need what's the what's coming next for Stell my one of my favorite Meridian highlights to answer ruger's question was watching Tyler's Hy presentation as he talked to his pre-recording self and said well thank you Tyler in his beautiful podcaster voice as he presented between his live demo and his a lot of comments about, that I don't feel like many of them they were like just underhanded like oh, that was interesting choice of you to pre-record everything yeah maybe we'll try to do it live. And then the internet will out and everyone will just be sitting there watching me fumble. And then we'll see who's laughing the dev meeting back on

[51:00] YouTube wait do we do Dev meetings on YouTube oh like putting them up on YouTube yeah it is the we have actually started uploading it there's a playlist on the St YouTube channel there playlist for us meetings and this one will come up shortly too. So yes 2025 year of De meeting on YouTube [Laughter] oh yeah the playlist is up right. Now but we are going to stream it as, that's the plan to stream it both on Twitch and YouTube at the same time there you go cool all right well thanks everyone oh best way to reach the core team get have discussions Google group or something else show up with the SF office on the door DM kale no, that will not

[52:00] work they're in Discord right A lot of them are in Discord again you don't Pi the route, that everybody else takes it's talking in Discord and asking specific questions being clear I can always get the attention, that you might work all right cool yeah coming to you live from the orus it's the never thanks everyone thank you we'll see you all around
