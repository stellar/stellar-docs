- hello hello everyone welcome to sorbon talks I'm anujia I'm from the Stellar development foundation and I'm super excited to bring on our amazing sorbon developer Lee and our Deborah lead Tyler onto stream hi everyone hi friends all right so uh this is Lee's first time on stream with me and also it's like my second stream and we're considering making this into a stream a series of some sort so if y'all want to do that let me know in the comments um because I I would love to if y'all want to see me more on stream and Tyler on stream we can all alternate Tyler but um yeah hey everyone so we're gonna start off by playing a game of chrome Dino I don't know Tyler have you ever played Chrome Dino all the times that my internet goes down out here in the country my score is still not very good but I do like a little Chrome Dino exactly so we're gonna start off by competing with Lee Tyler and myself and see who gets the high score um on Chrome Dyno and then we will jump right it's like ultimate beta switch we're gonna play Chrome dino games you're actually sorry we're just gonna start playing Chrome Dino and uh figure out who's the best from Dino Champion it's Stellar all right so Tyler I'm gonna let you start first um and we're gonna see how you do oh my gosh we're not gonna do these concurrently all right here we go yeah we're gonna see who does we're all watching okay in the meantime it's gonna soak up all five minutes here I'm gonna start getting my practice in I don't think it's gonna take all five minutes Tyler you can't be that good I don't know my skills oh but hey Kanye Nest conniness uh wrath is in here there you go I'm using here and hello hello feeling stressed watching this right that's I died there we go right when Raph said feeling stressed watching this Tyler you know all right Lee are you ready for this I'm ready so uh 3 55 3 55.
- okay all right I'm frustrated there's two more zeros after that like people actually are getting that high foreign to it the double jump uh speaker busted Okay Tyler takes the eye I'm like we'll have good RAF are you gonna make us an nft for whoever uh his high score on this all right here we go wait why is it oh okay here's cactuses it's not even fair you have to run like 100 feet before you even hit it all right all right all right we're getting there that additional like twinkle sound whenever you jump over or I guess whenever you get like a hundred or something it's very stressful okay better than Lee I'm proud of that all right sweet so we could play another round or we could keep going I think we should just kick it off how do you feel about that yeah let's get rolling all right so a couple different announcements uh while we get settled in is basically today's stream will be about um one two things actually so we have an instant Dev environment set up for sorbon so if you're someone like me who is basically never touched Russ till soroban started um and is just now getting started and has come from like a web to like react python background and you're like how do I freaking get started on Russ well we have an answer for you rightly the get pod answer so we're gonna share that today um with all of you and do a couple different demos with it and this is your chance to ask sorbon Dev Lee uh I keep saying that Lee I hope you're okay with me calling you the the Thor of on death League um but a q a with him uh I posted in our um Discord a link and I will share that here as well but it's basically a link for you to um put in your questions as you get them you're also more than welcome to share them on the stream uh we'll see this chat on stream as well um so whatever works for you uh use it as you like and if you actually want to come on stream uh let me know in the chat on the Discord which is the hashtag live chat um which is the live chat Channel and I will uh DM you the link to join us on stream actually and bring you on but that will be a bit later on straight so I'll let Tyler kick it off um go on go on in super yeah so um as we mentioned last week I kind of uh dove into sort of on myself for the first time a couple weeks ago um I I was very intimidated by it I was also very busy um and the the idea of trying to learn uh rust was kind of like no thanks think I'll save that for later um but uh necessity kind of pushed itself you know okay where everybody's learning sorobon now and this is kind of the thing that I've wanted ever since I found Stellar way way back and wanted to do something that Stellar didn't have an operation for uh the ability to have a smart contract running uh behind a single Stellar operation so we'll get into the nitty-gritty of exactly what's going on but I found it to be far far easier to kind of get up and running than I thought it would be most of these rust smart contracts are actually really um small compact a lot of your programming interfaces uh will actually be on the front end which is typical of smart contract development um so it's not that hard and now that we've introduced the get pod thing so I was like I was coming two weeks ago and then I found get pod and oh my goodness uh like you just you just click a link and you have a full rust sarobon environment right inside your browser it's it's the um vs code editor which is the one I use every day anyway um which is amazing which is kind of this call out to we're going to be doing Stellar Quest anybody is familiar with Stellar Quest our next Stellar Quest is going to be a sarobon quest and it's going to be all done right inside of a git POG so we're not a Kanye we're not going to have to answer all of these um hey I'm using Windows and can't figure out how to install rust we're just going to focus on the sorobond pieces not on the environment rust future net configurations it's uh kind of compiling all this into the quick wins of just figuring out getting our feet wet um building out smart contracts so I am going to bring my screen up and by me I mean a new here bring my screen up to um introduce something that I think Lee you added maybe last night inside of our Docs if you go to any of these examples they now have an open in get pod link which will open up all of these different examples right inside the the VM the get pod VM where you can run these examples right inside of our uh example soroban examples repo it opens up that repo inside of a gitpod which is amazing uh we're not going to do that right off the bat though I'm going to I'm going to open it up with we've got a sort of on Pioneer Quest we're actually still building this out but I thought I'd go ahead and share this this is kind of the idea is this is going to be a pretty big deviation from what we've normally done with Stellar Quest where you're playing it with laboratory you're doing it in quest.stellar.org now you're going to be doing the class right inside of a get pod which will be a little bit disorienting right especially for people like nisho who get um very angsty and start clicking buttons when they don't quite know what they do yet so this is going to be allow you to kind of familiarize yourself with the environment and that's we're going to walk through today is this kind of get pod environment I'm going to walk you through uh this is not going to I'm not going to try very hard not to leak any of our quests in this repo so the actual repos the secret repo good luck finding it um but this particular one you can go ahead and find and open up I'll be adding uh Elliot's writing some really good um readme material I think he's even going to do a video you'll get to see Elliot on screen that'll be fun uh walking through the get pod so you'll have no excuses to know exactly how to uh compete in the in the Stellar Quest whenever we get these these live hopefully in November okay so if you click this open and get pod that's gonna launch your new get pod instance I've it takes a couple minutes to uh spin one of these up not minutes it takes a few seconds to spin one of these up but depending on whether there's another pre-build running or um what have you so I've already got one stood up here uh in my my browser here this is probably quite tiny so let me increase the size of that slightly um so what you're seeing here basically you've got a couple of different areas of navigation if you're familiar with code editors IDs at all particularly vs code this is going to at least not feel completely uh foreign to you but let me let me just go ahead and walk through a couple of these items and then we'll begin interacting with them make sure to be keeping in Your Mind questions write those down in notes or something or that type form that a newfia sent out so we can answer those later on particularly ones that I won't be able to answer because I am still a newbie like everybody except for Lee um all right so probably one of the most uh critical pieces other than the actual code that we'll be looking through is your um bash terminal tab over here so I've actually got a futurenet that spins up with this get pod and so if you were to go to like the ports over here this little ports tab you can open up this is actually delivering right from inside this get pod you've got your futurenet we can see the latest ingested Ledger uh one zero zero three one so uh we're syncing successfully with the future net that's amazing that all gets configured for you um if you ever want to explore like okay that's fancy but it's a lot of magic inside of this git pod is the commands that actually spin up these different um terminals so you can see exactly what commands are being run so this is how we actually run up that um that Docker quick start saurabhand Dev Docker image so that's pretty that's pretty cool the other two things we've got going on are this futurenet bash and a sandbox bash so these other two terminal Windows uh this first one is one will be we'll interact with both but this one the sandbox is kind of this safe local playground doesn't interact at all with that future net that we have and then this this futurenet one this one's connected with environment variables uh attached right into the um into the bash window with all the environment variables we'll need to actually interact with this future net that we have running so you can see these environment variables running on this futurenet CLI so those get passed into the environment on that bash so um it's to try and help you if you accidentally like want to run a future net inside sandbox you'll just have to pass these environment variables yourself and if you want to run sandbox in the future net you'd have to toss those environment variables so if you end up running into errors or issues pass in them manually or um you can just look over here and try and toggle back and forth every now and then you will definitely get boogered and maybe just restart your git pod uh or figure out the magic from inside of this gitpod yaml file for the commands that were actually run to spin those up you can use zoom in a little bit um into the screen not everyone is as old as you are new here darn uh yes good good point um there we go much better or even Kanye can see it yep um all right so those are our terminal Windows we've only got three running up in here um let's go through uh we've talked about the environments the the future net here so this is the this is a quick start image that basically spins up your own like Watcher node um but it's connected directly to the same future net that's running that you can like access in uh laboratory right now for example so things that we do inside the future net here will will show up uh in like if we were to explore operations for a particular account so that's all quite nice the main obvious thing that we're all here to do though is to actually um build and test and run um contracts and this is where we start to touch a actual rust code I've only got one Quest up in here right now uh really to kind of emphasize just the environment and learning that bit first I just pulled the hello world example um from the example the soroban examples repository so that's the one that's building up up here so if we run you could run cargo I guess uh make build but um for people that are maybe unfamiliar with the make file it's basically if you're coming from the JavaScript world it's just like the scripts inside the package so it's basically just going to run this command I'm going to allow pastes because I'm not my own hacker um sweet so that was nice and quick less than um a half of a second and that'll put that built wasm file so you write rust and then it compiles down to a wasm executable that's the thing that you'll actually deploy or run on the contract so a lot of times when you've got the sorobon CLI and you're calling something you'll be referencing this particular wasm file which Speaking of saurabhan you can we've got uh those installed the the sorobon command if you're like okay well that's also magic how'd you install that guy um Lee has built us a nice little Docker image that pulls in the default uh get pod Docker image loads up all the stuff we need for that and then it installs things like sorobon and cargo hack and some other things that we might need I'm actually working on a stellar Quest CLI um so the you can run all of your Stellar quests right from the command line I'll also install that as an executable inside of this Docker file as well so between the get pod and the gitpod docker file most of the magic is contained within there which is helpful to know for the pro users out there so anyway we've got our sort of on command line got loads of um nice sub commands to run here like invoke inspect uh all those wonderful things let's go ahead and really quick so we went ahead and uh we um bundled built the the contract so it exists you can see right here 13 lines of rust code to say things like hello something which okay fair enough that's not that crazy um but usually there isn't that much rust code to actually pull off some pretty complex logic like if you look at some of the I think we've even got an amm example in there we've got lots of examples and I don't think any of them ever really start to cross Beyond like 200 300 lines of code most rust contracts are just very Compact and small and once you understand two things first rust is actually um really like when you run things they'll break but they often will tell you exactly what you did wrong um but also a lot of the rust stuff um is contained within the standard library and so a lot of the things you might need to learn or do would be inside the standard library but we've got this flag here that says no standard Library many times that will bite you if you're if you're very experienced in react uh you're like where's all my strings and map hash maps and stuff um but where there is no standard Library there's the sorobon SDK um it's nice because if you're coming from JavaScript and you're just trying to learn this thing there's actually less rust stuff you can do which keeps that scope of things to learn quite minimal and keeps all of the documentation right inside of that sarabon.stellar.org forward slash docs all the things you need to know are kind of within that domain which is super nice um all right sweet so I'm going to see if I can remember how to actually run this contract so we've got it built so we should be able to actually call it I'm going to make sure I'm in my sandbox CLI and if I remember my homework we should be able to do sorobon invoke and whenever you get lost you can add that H flag and it will tell you the different options that you have available so we are going to need a an ID and this uh wasm location and then if it's got although we need to call the specific function and then any arguments that it might contain if we were running it on the RPC we would either need to pass these flags or they will be pre-filled you'll notice if I run this exact same command soroban in Vogue help um these sarobon are these RPC secrets are already filled in for us so that we'll use those by default if we're using this particular um bash tab which is nice okay so we got that let's go into we need an ID which we'll just pass it one doesn't really matter because we're going to be calling it locally right off of the target I'm at root in my directory so I should just be able to go Target so this is going to be our actual wasm file that we're targeting Target wasn't releases and I think the name of this was soroban contract Blossom the argument I guess before we call our argument we need a function what function are we going to call the functions we have available to us are a big fat stack of one of them uh and it's hello and as per tradition we will call the argument with world and when we run that we get the response just like it told us it would print out the symbol hello and then the two that we passed it which is also this symbol which is the argument that we included so we start with this default environment argument and the second one is that argument that we passed and you could include other arguments if you wanted but we just had this one world and then it's going to print back this vector hello world fantastic that's amazing you might say but that's not actually a network fair enough let's see if we can copy the same thing over to our future net brilliant okay so we before we can invoke though the function contract actually needs to exist on chain so let's go ahead and deploy I think that's a command it is indeed um we need to deploy it with the wasm file and I think that's basically all we have to do because our secret key RPC nodes Network passphrases are already filled in for us so deploy Verizon from the target 1132 release Urban that's going to deploy that straight on to our future net uh amazing so this is our uh contract hash so if we wanted to go and invoke I'm going to do the crazy thing of just copying this moving it over to our future net and the only thing we need to change here assume that rebuilt a good futurenet he honestly didn't build the future now there's lots of people involved you also want to remove the uh the wasn't I need to remove the wasn't this is what this is yep passing an actual ID we don't need that we should send that straight over to the Future net and we get Hello World back now I know like many of you you're thinking well that's fancy show it to me in laboratory well I can't actually run this in laboratory yet but what I can do uh is show you the operation that we just committed and I'm going to do that by committing the cardinal sin of looking up that secret key that I use so let's actually let's do something a little bit different let's generate a Brand New Key pair on futurenet which all of them are the same so let's just paint that I'm going to write this down in the notes that I have over here so I don't forget it right sweet so now we're going to go and we're going to deploy this again this time we're going to use a new secret key that one that we just included so that I don't have to commit the Cardinals in deriving a public key from the secret key on stream which I did just generate a key on screen but that's fine it's a test net whatever okay so we committed that submitted that so if we right now if we went and looked up our explore endpoints operations for account and we just order this by descending we're going to notice that brand new operation invoke host function that's really the only operation that classic Stellar has kind of added and it's um very cryptic and hard to understand which is why we have Lee here let's go ahead and call another one so we did the deploy now we can do the invoke got a new contract ID so let's put that in unless we pass our new put that right here new secret key there's nothing fancy with the secret key it's just a stellar thing you're just signing the transaction that you're going to submit to the Future net uh but rather than having to like submit an xdr or something you can just pass in the secret key as an argument and it will do all of the signing and submitting um for you so there we go we got our hello world back and if we run this again we should see two host invoke host functions so that was the one that actually built the or uh submitted the contract create contract with Source account is the function and this one is host function host function invoke contract uh but again uh Wicked um obfuscated behind the Allure of what in the world does this xdr actually have behind it so that's kind of where my demo ends this is like to me this is again kind of mind-blowing where you can build these things relatively quickly and easily whether it's on futurenet and actually able to explore it inside of horizon or in your sandbox right we could just go in here and do a public function that reads something or maybe it saves some data all those other examples that we were showing but like it's actually pretty simple to write a contract and then deploy it run it and see it in laboratory just like you would do with anything else you might do with Stellar the only difference is what we had before was here's an operation that is make a payment okay but I want to do something fancy too bad you can make a payment with this operation now we have an operation that is invoke smart contract which does whatever the heck you want to inside of whatever the functions are behind the contract that was uploaded so it's like this um do whatever you want operation uh in stellar and my goodness I've wanted that for a long time and to actually see it working and it's kind of simple and you've got this nice git pod environment to do all this stuff I don't know about you but I think I'm going to quit working for SDF and start writing smart contracts because this this I haven't been this excited about actually building on Stellar since I found Stellar way back in 2014.

Anup, Leigh, and Tyler used this Soroban Talks episode to show how developers can get hacking without installing anything locally. They fired up the Gitpod template, walked through the pre-wired sandbox, Futurenet, and CLI terminals, and showed how each port exposes a running node or service so builders can follow along in Stellar Quest.

With the environment ready, they cloned the sample Hello World contract, compiled it to Wasm, and used the Soroban CLI to invoke it both locally and against the bundled Futurenet. Along the way they highlighted where Docker images install the toolchain, how to reset a Gitpod workspace, and what documentation/videos are coming next.

Key discussion threads:

- Layout of the Gitpod starter: sandbox vs Futurenet terminals, environment variables, and the Docker commands executed on boot.
- Building and invoking a sample Rust contract via the Soroban CLI, including how to point subcommands at the compiled Wasm.
- Tips for Stellar Quest participants-resetting a workspace, watching new README videos, and using Gitpod ports to inspect the running node.
