This session focused on lowering the barrier to entry for smart contract development on Stellar by introducing an instant, browser-based development environment powered by Gitpod. The speakers demonstrated how developers—especially those new to Rust—can start building Soroban contracts without installing toolchains or configuring local environments.

The conversation blended a live demo with practical guidance, showing how the preconfigured Gitpod workspace includes Soroban CLI, sandbox and Futurenet terminals, and example contracts. By compiling, deploying, and invoking a simple Hello World contract, the team illustrated the full developer flow from code to on-chain execution, while highlighting how this setup will support upcoming Stellar Quest challenges.

### Key Topics

- Overview of the Gitpod-based Soroban dev environment and why it removes local setup friction
- Preconfigured terminals: sandbox vs. Futurenet, environment variables, and Docker startup commands
- Using the Soroban CLI to build Rust contracts into Wasm artifacts
- Deploying and invoking contracts locally and on Futurenet
- Inspecting contract invocations and host function operations via Horizon and XDR
- Writing and running Rust-based unit tests for Soroban contracts
- Understanding concepts like SCVal, contract arguments, and ledger footprints
- How preflight/simulation helps determine footprints automatically
- How this environment ties into future Stellar Quest and learning content

[00:00] Hello hello everyone welcome to Soroban talks I'm anujia I'm from the Stellar Development Foundation and I'm super excited to bring on our amazing Soroban developer Lee and our Deborah lead Tyler onto stream hi everyone hi friends all right. So this is Lee's first time on stream with me and also it's like my second stream and we're considering making this into a stream a series of some sort so. If y'all want to do, that let me know in the comments. Because I would love to. If y'all want to see me more on stream and Tyler on stream we can all alternate Tyler. But yeah hey everyone. So we're gonna start off by playing a game of chrome Dino I don't know Tyler have you ever played Chrome Dino all the times, that my internet goes down out here in the country my score is still not very good. But I do like a little Chrome Dino exactly. So

[01:00] we're gonna start off by competing with Lee Tyler and myself and see who gets the high score on Chrome Dyno. And then we will jump right it's like ultimate beta switch we're gonna play Chrome dino games you're actually sorry we're just gonna start playing Chrome Dino and figure out who's the best from Dino Champion it's Stellar all right. So Tyler I'm gonna let you start first and we're gonna see how you do oh my gosh we're not gonna do these concurrently all right here we go yeah we're gonna see who does we're all watching okay in the meantime it's gonna soak up all five minutes here I'm gonna start getting my practice in I don't think it's gonna take all five minutes Tyler you can't be, that good I don't know my skills oh. But hey Kanye Nest conniness wrath is in here there you go I'm using here and

[02:00] hello feeling stressed watching this right, that's I died there we go right. When Raph said feeling stressed watching this Tyler you know all right Lee are you ready for this I'm ready. So 3 55. Okay all right I'm frustrated there's two more zeros after, that like people actually are getting, that high foreign to it the double jump speaker busted Okay Tyler takes the eye I'm like we'll have good RAF are you gonna make us an NFT for whoever his high score on this all right here we go wait why is it oh okay here's cactuses it's not even fair you have to run like

[03:00] 100 feet before you even hit it all right we're getting there, that additional like twinkle sound whenever you jump over or I guess whenever you get like a hundred or something it's very stressful okay better than Lee I'm proud of, that all right sweet. So we could play another round or we could keep going I think we should just kick it off how do you feel about, that yeah let's get rolling all right. So a couple different announcements. While we get settled in is basically today's stream will be about one two things actually. So we have an instant Dev environment set up for Soroban so. If you're someone like me who is basically never touched Russ till Soroban started and is just. Now getting started and has come from like a web to like react python background and you're like how do

[04:00] I freaking get started on Russ well we have an answer for you rightly the get pod answer. So we're gonna share, that today with all of you and do a couple different demos with it and this is your chance to ask Soroban Dev Lee I keep saying, that Lee I hope you're okay with me calling you the Thor of on death me calling you the Thor of on death League. But a Q&A with him I posted in our Discord a link and I will share, that here as well. But it's basically a link for you to put in your questions as you get them you're also more than welcome to share them on the stream we'll see this chat on stream as well. So whatever works for you use it as you like and. If you actually want to come on stream let me know in the chat on the Discord, which is the hashtag live chat, which is the live chat Channel and I will DM you the link to join us on

[05:00] stream actually and bring you on but, that will be a bit later on straight. So I'll let Tyler kick it off go on in super yeah. So as we mentioned last week I kind of dove into sort of on myself for the first time a couple weeks ago I was very intimidated by it I was also very busy and the idea of trying to learn rust was kind of like no thanks think I'll save, that for later. But necessity kind of pushed itself you know okay where everybody's learning Soroban. Now and this is kind of the thing, that I've wanted ever since I found Stellar way back and wanted to do something, that Stellar didn't have an operation for the ability to have a smart contract running behind a single Stellar operation. So we'll get into the nitty-gritty of exactly what's going on. But I found it to be far easier to kind of get up and running than I

[06:00] thought it would be most of these rust smart contracts are actually really small compact a lot of your programming interfaces will actually be on the front end, which is typical of smart contract development. So it's not, that hard and now, that we've introduced the get pod thing. So I was like I was coming two weeks ago. And then I found get pod and oh my goodness like you just click a link and you have a full rust sarobon environment right inside your browser it's the vs code editor, which is the one I use every day anyway, which is amazing, which is kind of this call out to we're going to be doing Stellar Quest anybody is familiar with Stellar Quest our next Stellar Quest is going to be a sarobon quest and it's going to be all done right inside of a git POG. So we're not a Kanye we're not going to have to answer all of these hey I'm using Windows and can't figure out how to install rust we're just going to focus on the Soroban pieces not on the environment rust future net

[07:00] configurations it's kind of compiling all this into the quick wins of just figuring out getting our feet wet building out smart contracts. So I am going to bring my screen up and by me I mean a new here bring my screen up to introduce something, that I think Lee you added maybe last night inside of our Docs. If you go to any of these examples they. Now have an open in get pod link, which will open up all of these different examples right inside the VM the get pod VM where you can run these examples right inside of our example Soroban examples repo it opens up, that repo inside of a gitpod, which is amazing we're not going to do, that right off the bat, though I'm going to open it up with we've got a sort of on Pioneer Quest we're actually still building this out. But I thought I'd go ahead and share this is kind I'd go ahead and share this is kind of the idea is this is going to be a

[08:00] pretty big deviation from what we've normally done with Stellar Quest where you're playing it with laboratory you're doing it in `quest.stellar.org`. Now you're going to be doing the class right inside of a get pod, which will be a little bit disorienting right especially for people like nisho who get very angsty and start clicking buttons. When they don't quite know what they do yet. So this is going to be allow you to kind of familiarize yourself with the environment and, that's we're going to walk through today is this kind of get pod environment I'm going to walk you through this is not going to try very hard not to leak any of our quests in this repo. So the actual repos the secret repo good luck finding it. But this particular one you can go ahead and find and open up I'll be adding Elliot's writing some really good readme material I think he's even going to do a video you'll get to see Elliot on screen, that'll be fun walking through the get pod. So you'll have no excuses to know exactly how to compete in the Stellar Quest

[09:00] compete in the Stellar Quest whenever we get these live hopefully in November okay so. If you click this open and get pod, that's gonna launch your new get pod instance I've it takes a couple minutes to spin one of these up not minutes it takes a few seconds to spin one of these up. But depending on whether there's another pre-build running or what have you. So I've already got one stood up here in my browser here this is probably quite tiny. So let me increase the size of, that slightly. So what you're seeing here basically you've got a couple of different areas of navigation. If you're familiar with code editors IDs at all particularly vs code this is going to at least not feel completely foreign to you. But let me just go ahead and walk through a couple of these items. And then we'll begin interacting with them make sure to be keeping in Your Mind questions write those down in notes or something or, that type form, that a newfia sent out. So we can answer those later on particularly ones, that I won't be able to answer. Because I am still a

[10:00] newbie like everybody except for Lee all right. So probably one of the most critical pieces other than the actual code, that we'll be looking through is your bash terminal tab over here. So I've actually got a futurenet, that spins up with this get pod and so. If you were to go to like the ports over here this little ports tab you can open up this is actually delivering right from inside this get pod you've got your futurenet we can see the latest ingested Ledger one zero three one. So Ledger one zero three one. So we're syncing successfully with the future net, that's amazing, that all gets configured for you. If you ever want to explore like okay, that's fancy. But it's a lot of magic inside of this git pod is the commands, that actually spin up these different terminals. So you can see exactly what commands are being run. So this is how we actually run up, that Docker quick start saurabhand

[11:00] Dev Docker image so, that's pretty cool the other two things we've got going on are this futurenet bash and a sandbox bash. So these other two terminal Windows this first one is one will be we'll interact with both. But this one the sandbox is kind of this safe local playground doesn't interact at all with, that future net, that we have. And then this futurenet one this one's connected with environment variables attached right into the bash window with all the environment variables we'll need to actually interact with this future net, that we have running. So you can see these environment variables running on this futurenet CLI. So those get passed into the environment on, that bash. So it's to try and help you. If you accidentally like want to run a future net inside sandbox you'll just have to pass these environment variables yourself and. If you want to run sandbox in the future net you'd have to toss those environment variables so. If you

[12:00] end up running into errors or issues pass in them manually or you can just look over here and try and toggle back and forth every. Now and. Then you will definitely get boogered and maybe just restart your git pod or figure out the magic from inside of this gitpod yaml file for the commands, that were actually run to spin those up you can use zoom in a little bit into the screen not everyone is as old as you are new here darn yes good point there we go much better or even Kanye can see it yep all right. So those are our terminal Windows we've only got three running up in here let's go through we've talked about the environments the future net here the environments the future net here. So this is the this is a quick start image, that basically spins up your own like Watcher node. But it's connected directly to the same future net, that's running, that you can like access in laboratory right

[13:00] now for example. So things, that we do inside the future net here will show up in like. If we were to explore operations for a particular account so, that's all quite nice the main obvious thing, that we're all here to do, though is to actually build and test and run contracts and this is where we start to touch a actual rust code I've only got one Quest up in here right. Now really to kind of emphasize just the environment and learning, that bit first I just pulled the hello world example from the example the Soroban examples repository so, that's the one, that's building up here so. If we run you could run cargo I guess make build. But for people, that are maybe unfamiliar with the make file it's basically. If you're coming from the JavaScript world it's just like the scripts inside the package. So it's basically just going to run

[14:00] this command I'm going to allow pastes. Because I'm not my own hacker sweet so, that was nice and quick less than a half of a second and, that'll put, that built wasm file. So you write rust. And then it compiles down to a wasm executable, that's the thing, that you'll actually deploy or run on the contract. So a lot of times. When you've got the Soroban CLI and you're calling something you'll be referencing this particular wasm file, which Speaking of saurabhan you can we've got those installed the Soroban command. If you're like okay well, that's also magic how'd you install, that guy Lee has built us a nice little Docker image, that pulls in the default get pod

[15:00] Docker image loads up all the stuff we need for, that. And then it installs things like Soroban and cargo hack and some other things, that we might need I'm actually working on a Stellar Quest CLI. So the you can run all of your Stellar quests right from the command line I'll also install, that as an executable inside of this Docker file as well. So between the get pod and the gitpod docker file most of the magic is contained within there, which is helpful to know for the pro users out there. So anyway we've got our sort of on command line got loads of nice sub commands to run here like invoke inspect all those wonderful things let's go ahead and really quick. So we went ahead and we bundled built the contract. So it exists you can see right here 13 lines of rust code to say things like hello something, which

[16:00] okay fair enough, that's not, that crazy. But usually there isn't, that much rust code to actually pull off some pretty complex logic like. If you look at some of the I think we've even got an AMM example in there we've got lots of examples and I don't think any of them ever really start to cross Beyond like 200 300 lines of code most rust contracts are just very Compact and small and once you understand two things first rust is actually really like. When you run things they'll break. But they often will tell you exactly what you did wrong. But also a lot of the rust stuff is contained within the standard library. And so a lot of the things you might need to learn or do would be inside the standard library. But we've got this flag here, that says no standard Library many times, that will bite you. If you're very experienced in react you're like where's all my strings and map hash maps and stuff. But where there is no standard Library there's the Soroban SDK

[17:00] it's nice. Because if you're coming from JavaScript and you're just trying to learn this thing there's actually less rust stuff you can do, which keeps, that scope of things to learn quite minimal and keeps all of the documentation right inside of, that `soroban.stellar.org` forward slash docs all the things you need to know are kind of within, that domain, which is super nice all right sweet. So I'm going to see. If I can remember how to actually run this contract. So we've got it built. So we should be able to actually call it I'm going to make sure I'm in my sandbox CLI and. If I remember my homework we should be able to do Soroban invoke and whenever you get lost you can add, that H flag and it will tell you the different options, that you have available. So we are going to need a an ID and this wasm location and then. If it's got, although we need to call the specific function. And then any arguments, that it might contain. If we were running it on the RPC we

[18:00] would either need to pass these flags or they will be pre-filled you'll notice. If I run this exact same command Soroban in Vogue help these sarobon are these RPC secrets are already filled in for us so, that we'll use those by default. If we're using this particular bash tab, which is nice okay. So we got, that let's go into we need an ID, which we'll just pass it one doesn't really matter. Because we're going to be calling it locally right off of the target I'm at root in my directory. So I should just be able to go Target. So this is going to be our actual wasm file, that we're targeting Target wasn't releases and I think the name of this was Soroban contract Blossom the argument

[19:00] I guess before we call our argument we need a function what function are we going to call the functions we have available to us are a big fat stack of one of them and it's hello and as per tradition we will call the argument with world and. When we run, that we get the response just like it told us it would print out the symbol hello. And then the two, that we passed it, which is also this symbol, which is the argument, that we included. So we start with this default environment argument and the second one is, that argument, that we passed and you could include other arguments. If you wanted. But we just had this one world. And then it's going to print back this vector hello world fantastic, that's amazing you might say but, that's not actually a network fair enough let's see. If we can copy the same thing over to our future net brilliant okay. So we before we can

[20:00] invoke, though the function contract actually needs to exist on chain. So let's go ahead and deploy I think, that's a command it is indeed we need to deploy it with the wasm file and I think, that's basically all we have to do. Because our secret key RPC nodes network passphrases are already filled in for us. So deploy Horizon from the target 1132 release Urban, that's going to deploy, that straight on to our future net amazing. So this is our contract hash so. If we wanted to go and invoke I'm going to do the crazy thing of just copying this moving it over to our future net and the only thing we need to change here assume, that rebuilt a good futurenet he honestly didn't build the future. Now

[21:00] there's lots of people involved you also want to remove the wasn't I need to remove the wasn't this is what this is yep passing an actual ID we don't need, that we should send, that straight over to the Future net and we get Hello World back. Now I know like many of you're thinking well, that's fancy show it to me in laboratory well I can't actually run this in laboratory yet. But what I can do is show you the operation, that we just committed and I'm going to do, that by committing the cardinal sin of looking up, that secret key, that I use. So let's actually let's do something a little bit different let's generate a Brand New Key pair on futurenet, which all of them are the same. So let's just paint, that I'm going to write this down in the notes, that I have over here. So I don't forget it

[22:00] right sweet. So now we're going to go and we're going to deploy this again this time we're going to use a new secret key, that one, that we just included so, that I don't have to commit the Cardinals in deriving a public key from the secret key on stream, which I did just generate a key on screen but, that's fine it's a test net whatever okay. So we committed, that submitted, that so. If we right now. If we went and looked up our explore endpoints operations for account and we just order this by descending we're going to notice, that brand new operation invoke host function, that's really the only operation, that classic Stellar has kind of added and it's very cryptic and hard to understand, which is why we have Lee here let's go ahead and call another one. So we did the deploy. Now we can do the invoke got a new contract ID. So let's put, that

[23:00] in unless we pass our new put, that right here new secret key there's nothing fancy with the secret key it's just a Stellar thing you're just signing the transaction, that you're going to submit to the Future net. But rather than having to like submit an XDR or something you can just pass in the secret key as an argument and it will do all of the signing and submitting for you. So there we go we got our hello world back and. If we run this again we should see two host invoke host functions so, that was the one, that actually built the or submitted the contract create contract with Source account is the function and this one is host function invoke contract. But again Wicked obfuscated behind the Allure of what in the world does this XDR actually have

[24:00] behind it so, that's kind of where my demo ends this is like to me this is again kind of mind-blowing where you can build these things relatively quickly and easily whether it's on futurenet and actually able to explore it inside of Horizon or in your sandbox right we could just go in here and do a public function, that reads something or maybe it saves some data all those other examples, that we were showing. But like it's actually pretty simple to write a contract. And then deploy it run it and see it in laboratory just like you would do with anything else you might do with Stellar the only difference is what we had before was here's an operation, that is make a payment okay. But I want to do something fancy too bad you can make a payment with this operation. Now we have an operation, that is invoke smart contract, which does whatever the heck you want to inside of whatever the functions are behind the contract, that was uploaded. So it's like this do whatever you want operation in Stellar and my goodness I've wanted, that for a long time and to actually see it working and it's kind of

[25:00] simple and you've got this nice git pod environment to do all this stuff I don't know about you. But I think I'm going to quit working for SDF and start writing smart contracts. Because this I haven't been this excited about actually building on Stellar since I found Stellar way back in 2014. This is amazing and again like you're discovering Stellar for the first time in 2014 like okay sweet I think at the time there's like 12 things you could do with Stellar. And then now there's like 22 or something. Now there's an infinite number of things you can do with Stellar and, that is incredible like I was super excited before just finding Stellar. Now I mean this is something else and I don't know I'm I can't wait to start writing like NFT weird NFT smart contracts all, that stuff, that I was trying to do with Stellar Turrets, that was very difficult and lots of hoops to jump through. Now now this is this I can't wait to just start writing weird contracts my mind is it's been hard to shut down for all the crazy things I want to do

[26:00] I might have to create a pseudonym for Sora bonathon. So I can try and swoop in on some of those prizes okay enough with me talking you should show before you take it away you should show you how easy it is to write tests yeah I have no idea how to write a test I've never written a rest test in my life. So maybe is there what's in the test file is, that this one right here yes this is a real simple test yes this is a real simple test, that's just calling, that hello function exactly the same way, that you invoked on the command line and there's a little tiny text at the top of the function run test. If you click, that click the run test it's going to run it here in your browser. So you can individually run like. When you're running the entire test like is this. Now individually taking, that component and running a test on it please okay yeah exactly is, that what this mod test thing is how does it link

[27:00] between the list in the test file the mod test is just telling the project, that oh no what's going on here he's just telling the compiler, that other test rust file should be included. Because that all the rust files are not included by default they'll have to be referenced from, that lib from, that lib and it looks like we got some sort of bug in our GitHub setup. If you run a cargo clean Tyler. And then just try clicking, that run test again no debug it live is this like the most satisfying thing of giffpod I feel I mean it's satisfying anytime to watch anything compiled. But this is really satisfying This thing always gives me anxiety. Because it's like yes I've waited for 30 seconds to get to 142. And then I'll be

[28:00] an error and like oh shoot. Now I gotta fix, that. And then wait another five yeah there's a lot of dependencies. Because this what this test is doing is there's only what like five six lines of code here but, that M default, that's at the beginning of the test is actually the sorbent environment and it's not a mock environment it's the actual cyberon environment, that gets embedded in the Stellar Core nodes and we're using it here in the test so. When you're writing rust tests here in your contract you are actually testing your contract in much the same way, that it will be running on chain. So you have all the same things available to you can even do things like integration tests across other contracts. So you can import another contract, that you're calling or maybe several contracts you're calling and you can write tests using your contract and all of those contracts together and you know see for real how it's actually going to behave well, that's. So cool, that's is, that's one

[29:00] of the advantages of having like the entire thing be being written in Rust where you get this rust environment, that can be like pulled out of actually running it in core. But it's the actual environment, that is running in core exactly yay our test passed all of, that for one test okay it needs to be like capital okay I found this yeah it's like okay with an exclamation but, that could also mean it's not okay. But haha no anyone anyways lee there's a fun question, which is this a smart contract to find out what these Halloween costume will be this year yeah I'm gonna dress up as hello Dev it's not a bad idea yeah we're gonna have to have a little bit smarter contract very smart guess well at least Halloween costumes right. But Tyler. So you wanted to ask Lee some

[30:00] questions I believe yeah. So one of like my main question is I'm even as I'm writing Stiller Quest quests one of the things I'm gonna have to do is okay people are doing their quests they do their hello world like one of the first quests the spoiler alert might be to call hello world I know I can find, that they did, that. But I don't know how to prove, that in this, that they actually submitted hello world and I'm guessing it's something to do with one of these parameters maybe something with the footprint can you just like walk us through a am I going to be able to do like build a Stellar Quest off of the data, that I'm getting inside of the operations to check. If what someone submitted was what I expected. Because this XDR is not immediately helpful to me. And then secondarily to, that the heck is a footprint yeah these are good questions can you

[31:00] can you zoom in a little bit I'm sorry it's pretty small for me the yeah we've got three Fields here and you're right they don't really tell us a whole lot on the surface there's two tools we can use to understand like what this mumble jumble words are we can either use the laboratory whenever you've got in future net mode so. If you want to open, that up in another tab we can try putting, that into the laboratory putting, that into the laboratory you can also use the Sovereign CLI it also has a sub command where you can just paste this and it would print out this is what the value is. But maybe we can use the laboratory a lot of people. So yeah this is laboratory right here do you want me to copy one of these XDR values over to the view XDR yes okay. So I just copied this one with type object yeah. So what you want to do is grab the XTL type it should be SC Val. If you look

[32:00] for SC Val it'll be down there deep in the and okay it's not actually rendering something, that's super useful here, that's well I mean maybe, that's, that's b64 yeah base64 decode, that XYZ is a does this convert to okay wait you're singing strange URLs okay waiter oh no what is the what is this Valley we should have started with the second dude I don't remember okay we can start with the second time do the second one first I'm gonna try to see. If I can remember what the first one is and why we can't decode it oh the first one's the contract ID oh. So it's a hack or the contract function or something like, that. So let

[33:00] me let me run my super powerful other VM called run kit and do buffer a64. And then two string it's probably a hexia, that's our contract ID Maybe ish wish, that was not, that was the actual XDR value this was the a64d so, that's our contract hash right there all right so, that's one problem solved. Now we need this one Sim yes let's have a look at what, that is View XDR

[34:00] versus also an sc value this is also an essay file so. If you copy, that Sim value and stick it into the base64 decoder it should, that should come out as a string all right without the hex hello sick all right what's wait, that was our, first argument right by default oh, that was the output no, that's the input, that's the function name the parameter was the contract ID the second parameter was the function we're calling. And then all the parameters after, that are should be the arguments fingers crossed everybody wait I gotta turn it out of the XDR into a64. 864 will it say World question mark I can write my checks

[35:00] haha everyone you'll have to actually do what the challenge says or you're busted amazing and is it almost always so. When I look at view XDR this thing just got absolutely enormous are there many other things, that people will need to be aware of or is SC Val kind of cover most of our ground here scal covers any value, that's scal covers any value, that's being used as like an input or an output or unlike of a contract function as well as anything, that's being stored so. If you're storing something on chain some data to look up again later maybe light balances things like, that they're all ultimately going to be stored inside our cval and SC value is really a union of lots of other types. So here we can see this RC valve is a symbol there are integers there's like byte arrays Maps vectors begins they all fall under, that scale

[36:00] I spent too long trying to figure out how to decode this and I just had to get on stream, that's all I had to do, that makes a ton of sense all right fantastic well. Now I know how to bust everybody for passing the arguments and making sure they actually submit the right thing next the heck is a footprint this is also an XDR is this I really hope it has something to do with Bigfoot. But I'm guessing it doesn't you can try decoding, that. If you want I don't remember what the type is exactly it's probably The Ledger footprint is the type there's a contract ID and this is not necessarily particularly interesting for this specific contract. Because this contract doesn't access any data or anything like, that. So what well footprint is it's us telling the runtime what data the contract may write to or

[37:00] read from and the reason this exists is. Because we don't we want the runtime to know what data might the contract will need to be accessing. Because that helps us do things like run contracts concurrently at the same time. So so we're building sarban with the advantage, that we've seen other advantage, that we've seen other blockchains already build you know smart contract runtimes and we know, that scaling blockchains is difficult. And so we're planning, that from the get-go with Saruman and one of the foot the footprint is like part of the idea is, that. When you invoke a contract you define what data might need to be accessed by the contract. And then the runtime knows how to paralyze contracts, that don't need to access or write to the same data. So in this contract invocation. If we looked at the code you'd say it's not accessing any data. So why is there

[38:00] there's one entry here there's one read-only entry the contract data and the key is not particularly descriptive it's a static IC and what, that is the contract code IC and what, that is the contract code itself. So we're saying, that with this contractification the only contract data it needs to read or write is the actual contract code, that gets loaded into the runtime but. If you were writing. If you had a contract where you were updating a balance you would need to include The Ledger key in this footprint for the balance, that was planned to be updated I think, that's making sense I know they're. So yeah there's a question here. So what is the footprint of a function, that uses an environment invoke contract all right yeah, that's a good question it should be it'll be the footprint of whatever, that other contract requires. So at the

[39:00] very least it's going to require the contract code. So there'll be like another entry like what we see here on screen except the contract ID won't be the calling contractor will be the contract, that's going to be called and then. If that contract needs to go and access any data you would also need to being pre-included you need to be predetermining what data is going to be accessed and including, that in the football is there a limit to like the depth, that can go before it becomes difficult I mean there will be limits for the runtime especially like once it gets to pubnet I think we're still figuring out a lot of what those you know those levers should be set up. So for future net I mean future net doesn't have fees enabled either. So you know these are things, which we're building out and they'll be in building out and they'll be in future net iterations yeah I think a question, that maybe arises from this is you know I said

[40:00] that the footprint is something, that you have to predetermine you as the person building the transaction here to go and figure out what the footprint should be and, that maybe can be a bit of a daunting task. And so we have this thing called pre-flight or simulation where you can submit a transaction without the footprint. So no food required and it's not executed on chain it's just it's simulated. And then you get back it basically gives you back the footprint. So you can. Then just go and submit the transaction with, that footprint. So you don't really have to determine it yourself I know. When I was looking at the network requests inside of Paul's example dApp there was loads of those preflights whenever something was happening to go and find what the actual submission call should look like and it's also the way, that you do read requests so. If you're. If you don't actually need to submit something networking you just need to get data out of the network you can use those pre-flight requests to grab

[41:00] information from The Ledger from The Horizon endpoint without actually having to submit the transaction, which I thought was kind of cool there are a few other questions here it says like why have one type of SC value for everything architecture-wise question mark, that's a good question I think the values get used in a lot of places where you know like as function inputs function outputs and we really need one type, that's going to contain all those other types yeah, that's what I got, that flavor of design really comes from like the way, that XDR like the Stellar network, that XDR like the Stellar network uses XDR for structuring all of the data they get stored and, that's just a really common way of solving, that problem in the XTR

[42:00] I'm trying to see there are a few other questions here, that I guess we can shift a little bit. But it says how should one think. When writing Forum on contracts, that involves not mucking up keep it small and apparently write good tests. Because I made it a long way. And then I had to write a test and it broke. So so Rico tests start out really small I don't know have fun right Now it's like on futurenet. So play around learn what you're doing. But yeah Nisha you'll figure it out I believe in you do the Stellar Quest, that'll, that'll go a long way sorbonne Quest you mean Stellar requests saravan quest Quest version series I do have another question and this is particularly coming from a JavaScript engineer perspective

[43:00] is there a way to like watch contracts so, that as you make changes it kind of runs tests and compiles in like as you save files or is, that something you have to like always be building always be testing is the idea, that you just kind of Click run test every time you update some code sort of thing you fix your tests you sort of thing you fix your tests you write your code you run tests again what's the development flow tend to be. When making changes yeah I mean there's a couple of options here it really comes down to you know what you like to do. If you're a vs code user there should be my shortcut codes are customized. So I won't say what it is. Because I don't know what the default is. But there's a shortcut code you can press to run the last test or run the test under your current cursor. And so a common development flow is you just keep hitting, that key after you've made some

[44:00] changes and it'll go run the tests you care about in, that moment there's another great tool called cargo watch, which you can it may actually be installed in this GitHub I think. If I saw it was installed in the docker file and. If you use cargo watch by default it probably just builds and, that may not be where we want but. If you I think it's like cargo watch space Dash X space test and, that will just run the tests every time you change the files cool yeah. So this I think by default it just right just builds. And then tests yeah, that makes sense and I will definitely help it's just a very foreign environment. But it's not a poor one it's just a very foreign environment for a JavaScript developer. So knowing what, that narrative is like for actively working on a contract is an important one

[45:00] that was just a link, that I wanted to share well I guess Kanye West wanted to share yeah. If there are Rush developers in the chat, that have the ways, that they run these a submit it to the sorobonathon. Because I need to know how to build these faster and B put those in chat with links and such yeah it's one of the things I love about the rust Community is it's very aware of how hard it is to learn rust. And so people are very eager to share all the things, that they do and the tips and tricks they have for getting up to speed and actually building contracts and stuff yes. So you can yeah you can write unit tests. But you can also write integration tests in the sense, that. If your contract is using other contracts you can download those contracts at the moment you just you have to manually download them as a DOT wasn't file in

[46:00] the future you know hopefully we'll have some like better mechanics around, that where they can just be automatically downloaded. But yeah you report, that wasn't file you can register, that contract in your test. So it's there registered in the environment just as. If it had been deployed on chain. And then your contract. When you're running its tests can be calling through to it. So you don't have to set up mocks you don't have to set up you know these fake tests with your. If you're contractors interacting with all these other things and we don't have this implemented today. But the environment can have data pre-loaded into it, that environment, that we saw in the tests. And so we do want to build toolings to do things like take data, that's on chain like. If you know you basically take like a specific Ledger. And then you could write tests, that actually use contracts, that are actually, that have been actually deployed as well as data

[47:00] that's been actually, that actually existed on let on The Ledger at, that point in time. So so there's another question, that came in through the Forum yearly, which says. When you execute a contract who provides the computing power to process the function normally. When I write a function and run it's my PC or server I arrange, that's burning some CPU Cycles how does, that work with colorbox is the question like during testing or do you mean like. When the contract is actually running I feel like they are probably referring to. When the contract is running execute yeah. When Tyler like deployed the contract on chain he uploaded all of, that the code onto not the compiled version of the contract onto the chain and then. When he invoked it he was giving the contract he was giving he was telling the chain like go and run this code. So the code is running on all of the nodes of the network and the nodes are all agreeing on like this

[48:00] is the outcome of running, that got it decentralization there are one more question, that came in here, which says how Soroban adopted zero knowledge grouping Soroban supports yeah I think we're like very interested I think in supporting like different crypto Primitives and. If you go and have a look in the Discord you know with there have been some conversations around like what crypto Primitives should we be supporting you know how for supporting things like, that right. Now the only crypto Primitives implemented is available in the Soroban SDK are just the really basic ones, that you would typically see in the Stellar ecosystem today things like shell 256 and add 25519 keys. But

[49:00] we're definitely very interested in finding out like you know what people want or see, that they need and we have ideas about what can be added and you know we'll definitely be looking into, that yep see I think, that is about all the questions, that there are anyone else have any final questions here I'd be curiously as you kind of have a really broad knowledge of Soroban where it's going and you're working with internal and external teams on road maps and are there things you'd really like to see people work on or provide feedback for or what's kind of the most exciting thing, that comes across your desk as far as Community engagement or things, that people are doing or maybe areas of opportunity, that you feel like people maybe aren't quite recognizing yet, that you'd like to ensure, that people are aware of and like what would you like to see come through sarbanathon yeah I think definitely the big ticket thing is writing contracts like getting more

[50:00] people writing contracts providing feedback around what they've found convenient or inconvenient around what they have found to be you know conceptually made sense you know they wanted to do X and the SDK helped them to do xor or didn't help them to do, that or got in their way we def like, that's I think probably the biggest thing is dog fooding the biggest thing is dog fooding writing contracts and discovering what's missing what the gaps are all, that sort of stuff, that's what really interests me and I've seen like a lot of good posts on this sorry I can't even say this sorry bethon, that have been very interesting and you know people exploring how does authentication work and ex providing examples of where it works really well where it's you know got some rough edges and like, that's got some rough edges and like, that's fantastic. Because that gives us all as a community the opportunity to

[51:00] figure out what needs to change between. Now where we're at right. Now future. Now version one what needs to change between. Now and getting to test. Now and pub. Now down the road yeah absolutely we actually had, that exact example come through this week I believe there you go wow Raph is already on it like sharing the links to it. But yeah no definitely like I think we wanna the whole reason for sore monathon to exist is like simply to help with the development and like dog fooding Soroban to like the ecosystem. And then to let our Dev team know how can they actually take it and improve Sargon right like we're listening basically I see another question here, which says oh yeah I think Connie Nets you have the right answer there where it is would SCF allow the next round is lower Bond related projects, that's probably like a it I would say yes probably. But don't quote me on, that. But yeah I'd say well we'll support

[52:00] once it hits mainnet. Because the point of SCF is to run live businesses kind of in production and. If you're please don't run a production level business on a test net or a futurenet. So be working on your business ideas. Now you can't just spin up a business in a month some of you probably could so, that there's like get started get ready so, that whenever there isn't a CF round, that is accepting. Because they're, that are built on top of Sarah bonathon Soroban wow it's not called sarobon anymore. Now it's just Sarah bonathon how the tables turn. Then we'll be ready to accept those inbounds. But it's definitely coming we just want to encourage people building businesses on top of test Nets, that said I would love to potentially we were just at like since this is like I consider this like a very casual conversation with our community. But we're considering maybe doing like a hackathon in the future by

[53:00] Future I mean like next month or the month after where basically it would be for you to come up with those ideas you can submit proposal Soroban related ideas and like do example contracts. And so on. And so forth. So we'd really like to see you like we don't want to stop you from ideating at the moment so. If you had ideas please start working on them. Because there will come a time. When we want those ideas brought to us from the community we want to support you the best way we can. So yeah and I'd say we'll probably like surabana Thon is sort of bonathon First Light we're gonna run more right the next one will be sorobanathon super tools or something where we're coming up with like a new theme new funding round looking for a different type of content and one of those might be some of the tooling, that we really want to see on the, that we really want to see on the network some of, that like opens Upland type contracts as the platform continues to mature and change less

[54:00] it'll become safer I guess to begin writing more of these mature production ready contracts. But we've got to be careful in the sequencing of things, that we don't write contracts, that are just going to be constantly breaking or make it kind of disincentivize an environment from breaking things in order to improve the final product. So you want to keep things a little platoy in the first early stages so, that the first early stages so, that it's fine to constantly be breaking things. Because nobody's built anything to mature yet the pub net is the takeaway here I guess. But yeah I think, that is everything for this week y'all once again Sarah bonathon is still a thing it's happening it's going to keep happening and keep playing. When tinkering with sarmon like you literally can earn excellent for doing, that I don't know why you aren't like I said I'm always ready to quit my job and start working on sarban. But I do like my job I like talking about

[55:00] it. But yeah anyways y'all thank you all for joining we will be back next week on Friday with senso actually talking about his assembly script SDK. So stay tuned for more details on, that we're really excited and, that's always a good time to just ask questions in general about sarban well, that's sarban thanks, that's a wrap on Soroban talks yeah thank you thanks a bunch see ya new here Lee
