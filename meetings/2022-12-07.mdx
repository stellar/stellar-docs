Anup, Leigh, and Tyler used this Soroban Talks episode to show how developers can get hacking without installing anything locally. They fired up the Gitpod template, walked through the pre-wired sandbox, Futurenet, and CLI terminals, and showed how each port exposes a running node or service so builders can follow along in Stellar Quest.

With the environment ready, they cloned the sample Hello World contract, compiled it to Wasm, and used the Soroban CLI to invoke it both locally and against the bundled Futurenet. Along the way they highlighted where Docker images install the toolchain, how to reset a Gitpod workspace, and what documentation/videos are coming next.

Key discussion threads:

- Layout of the Gitpod starter: sandbox vs Futurenet terminals, environment variables, and the Docker commands executed on boot.
- Building and invoking a sample Rust contract via the Soroban CLI, including how to point subcommands at the compiled Wasm.
- Tips for Stellar Quest participants-resetting a workspace, watching new README videos, and using Gitpod ports to inspect the running node.
