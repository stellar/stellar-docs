This call features a walkthrough of Trustless Work’s escrow model, positioning escrow as programmable infrastructure that can be reused across marketplaces and other platforms without requiring deep blockchain expertise. The discussion emphasizes reducing payment friction (cost, speed, transparency) and enabling flexible release conditions for funds.

The second segment shows how AI-based developer tools can help new Soroban builders iterate faster: generating code changes from plain-English prompts, updating tests, and using in-IDE explanations to learn concepts like storage choices without constantly switching contexts.

### Key Topics

- Trustless Work: Escrow on Stellar Overview
  - Trustless Work provides an escrow infrastructure that abstracts smart contract configuration, deployment, and interaction, making escrow workflows easier to integrate and operate.

[00:00] Hello and welcome to this week's Stellar Developer Meeting this new format where we are trying out twitch and we're trying a new format where we do shorter presentations. So let's see how it goes this hopefully this will go smooth. But it is the first time we're trying a new platform. So there might be some smaller hicups with my with me today I have Alberto, which I've had the pleasure meeting several times at different SDF events and he is going to talk about trustless work today. So please go ahead and introduce yourself and share your screen Alberto okay let me give me a second to present hello everybody my name is Alberto as he said I'm from Costa Rica I am building Cress work please

[01:00] confirm. If you can see my screen. Because I have one monitor. So I'm not sure. But I think you do okay and yeah ER we are building trustless work is ESC infrastructure for the new economy. So basically to understand a little bit what I'm talking about basically in very simplistic terms an escro is a neutral secure way to hold money or funds. While the ass. While something is happening H the most common use of escrow, that you might know is real estate escros, which in this case we use a an agent or an escro agent like a bank to hold the funds. While the legal inspections and the paperwork happens for a house. But we also have digital escrows in the case of eBay Who as a Marketplace they hold the fun. While the

[02:00] merchant actually delivers the product and same thing for upwork, which holds the fund. While the freelancer completes the deliverable but. If you try to build this today with Fiat payments it'll be next to Impossible and, that's. Because Legacy Astros as I call it have a huge problem, which is Fiat payments require banking they are very costly they're very slow they're very limited in flexibility they have transparency and they're obviously full of frictions, that. If you're here watching a seller call you understand the frictions, that fi payments provide. So not anymore at trustless work we're building the esro infrastructure. So basically we're abstracting the configuration deployment and interaction with smart contracts to create smart escros, which provide the same functionality as escrs and even more. Because they're cheap they're fast they're permissionless a transparent and

[03:00] Global. And so in this way marketplaces e-commerce directories trade file and many more use cases are unlocked, that can actually use this functionality without requiring a blockchain expertise what we're building in trustless work is also an ecosystem. So we're building in an open source way or all the asro tools the templates and the dev tools so, that it becomes as simple as possible to initialize fund sign review approve and release payments over sell network we are focused on USDC, which is again it's the one, that brings less friction We Believe for volatility. But we can all already use this on any asset admitted issued on Stellar network some of our traction a little bit of the story we started working this in July we got into the Astro Hacker

[04:00] House is sponsored by Stellar and Draper University, that's where we built the version one of the smart contracts the API and the documentation, which we launched on testet on a Costa Rican hackathon we also got accepted to the Stellar Draper U Embark program, which is where I'm at right. Now and we also participated in the only dust OD hack number 10, which allowed us to accelerate our development we got the escro version two done in an open source and the escro UI version one we also recently got awarded the an SCF Grant. So thank you very much for, that right. Now we're building the API version two. Because we're preparing for OD hack number 11 where again. If you want to contribute you're more than invited to contribute or another esro UI version too H some partner Integrations and there are some even research and

[05:00] tasks, that we're going to add there H we're getting ready for demo day on Draper U, which is by the end of January and we are going to be launching on mayet around q1 2025 probably around March H trustless work I mentioned only dust and this is something really interesting, that is happening with trustless work is, that our hackathon projects the ones, that were in the in a tested launch have evolved into becoming a vertical on their own. So each one of these projects was part by themselves of the only hack number 10 they got contributors by the themselves and they got funds to initialize their development and mature their development. So directly or indirectly I think trustless work has over 70 developers contributing to the ecosystem and all of these projects are going to become templates for Integrations, that are going to make easier to integrate trustless work into

[06:00] into all use cases probably and incoming we have a casino poker use cases who want to use escrow and trade F use cases one, that I want to stand out is KFI was able to build in a week crowdfunding H for social impact solution using our escros. So basically they use our escros as a deposit account where people can deposit funds and they the payment is released to the foundation by Milestones. So yeah we are getting into AI driven development also to accelerate how we are integrated in common use cases we are a core team of four and myself Alberto I'm the CEO and product lead I have experience as product manager even from Project since Corda to

[07:00] Ethereum to exerp base and Stellar and Joel Armando and calev they are the development team they have been contributing to Stark net and Ethereum ecosystems, and now they moved into Stellar also. Because of this project and we're also backed by a community of over 180 developers from latam from Latin America H, which is called Dojo coding shout out to them they're probably going to be here and yeah, that's what we're doing in trustless work the this is a linked to my LinkedIn. If you want to connect I will gladly do so. If you want to contribute please do and yeah we're building again the escrow infrastructure for the new economy and I'm very happy, that it's going to happen on Stellar great thank you for the presentation I think it's very exciting

[08:00] exciting how fast you have really been able to spin this up and already starting to get traction just a reminder are you on test net or are you on Main net right. Now we're on test net right. Now yeah. So yeah there's a lot of things we have to figure out ER be U before we launch a main with real funds H we won't make Revenue until we have we're on Main it. So yeah. But we don't want to rush, that we've gotten support from the community am from Draper and seller Ventures. So yeah we want to take our time with, that yeah. So so anyone who wants to explore what you're doing they can go to your website I have seen your documentation is pretty good. So I could actually start building on your platform right now. If I wanted to Yes, that's the idea yeah I've gotten really much into deil also I'm part of deil uni H. So I've been learning a lot about, that and yeah we're working on our docks and

[09:00] making as simple as possible to go from zero to hello world. So yeah I think, that we talked about previously was open sourcing and can you share a little bit about your experience with open sourcing your projects sure yeah it's been crazy I'm from product management. So I am used to like over communicating things and features like to make things clearer. But being open source really has been like a great effort like to think about who's gonna come I don't know them they have no context on our product. So how we can make like their life easier and gladly our core team Joel arando and cev they have experience already you know us. So they have been in the other side of Open Source contributions also. So they were they knew like the best

[10:00] yeah like the formats how to explain it h we're also leveraging AI also like I've learned, that Cod rabbit really helps like to start to describe H things and yeah look for improvements. But yeah I think, that the traction like how we were able like to build like I think by faes we got like the hackathon as phase one. So we built like trustless work was an API we got like these five teams building hackathon projects and after od10 like they're all like more mature like each one got like 20 contributors. So it's crazy how we were able like to start building this ecosystem, and now it's really interesting like to connect them like both, that we doing marketplaces to connect them. So they can start also accelerating their own and focus on different aspects of it h. So yeah I'm really excited on the opportunities and the possibilities, that

[11:00] this provides like to build, that ecosystem and to start even mapping contributions like. Now we're moving everything to GitHub like even the documentation all the work I do. Because it's not you know it's hard to track even what I do. So now we want to track it so. Because again we want to be able to leverage, that as much as possible and yeah we're getting we're learning a lot and it's really interesting, that's great you mentioned in your presentation real estate. Because that's probably where most of us know escros from. But can you maybe talk a little bit about what kind of projects, that are interested in using your service what kind of Industries they're in. Because I know it's not just real estate companies yeah I've gotten a lot of interest from Real Estate, that's for sure ER I myself I explain, that we are infrastructure provider like we are a technical partner like we are not building for real estate. But they

[12:00] can obviously leverage us. So this unlocks like for example for real estate agents or even lawyers to deploy their own escros and not require this banking agent, that may take three days two days and where's the wire kind of like experience, which is every what I get as feedback. But even more than, that for example a trade f is really interesting I'm from Costa Rica I mentioned earlier Costa Rica is a was just invited to join a trade Union with 14 countries in the Pacific. So it starts becoming really interesting like how are we going to handle payments you know with the new countries new economies, that we don't have like a lot of H Financial relationship with Malaysia Singapore Peru those kind of countries. So trade f is something, that's really interesting right. Now for us H. But also for example one of the teams buil used our ESR to create a security deposit solution for

[13:00] house rentals for example. If you think about it like every time you do a security deposit in any Hospitality car rentals house rentals like it's always the card processor and you never know where the money is and it's always blocked for a certain amount of time and nobody's responsible for, that and yeah they created this. Because escr are configurable in, that sense they created an escrow, that again is release back to myself unless there is a dispute so, that's like security deposits and. If you look for security deposit technology there's like not much out there H. So it becomes really interesting like to start experimenting with this and seeing for example. If we do a plugin for I don't know Cloud BS or like plugin for jeta or do this in integrate this in Shopify and different types of interactions, that are becoming really interesting and again we can only aboard those by being open source and getting as much contri to get this band with. Because yeah. If it was

[14:00] internal resources it would be impossible yeah and it sounds like it's not just crypto companies or crypto projects, that are interested in using your service actually maybe the opposite yeah and, that's Al also one of the main reasons we chose Stellar the anchor network and the unram and offrs partners yeah we don't we want them to be like have a good experience be able to send an a be able to send a wire it depends on the use case like even credit card or card processing. So so yeah there's all these partners, that we need to explore and start integrating or make it as simple as possible to integrate four people ER platforms we're going to use our technology. So yeah we're really excited for, that

[15:00] what other one yeah it's mostly, that crowdfunding is becoming really interesting also like for Aid like. If we make it very simple to deploy like this kind of esrs to receive payments from globally it's really interesting for Aid also. So there are a lot of opportunities to abstract the blockchain and yeah become yesterday I said I was preing yesterday and they said we wanted to become like the stripe of escros and, which is ambitious for me and somebody corrected me and said like no let's do the Salesforce for esos. So so. So yeah, that's the kind of infrastructure, that we want to provide and I think a EST Stellar is perfect for, that I think we are in a great moment for, that stable coin adoption is like booming and yeah hopefully we're right on time yeah it's amazing to see what your building and how fast

[16:00] you're doing it's really it's a huge inspiration also, that you really Embrace open source and I think, that's, that's you're really shown, that by embracing open source and putting it out there you get a lot of people playing around with it. So so yeah, that's, that's, that's great to see as well yeah the verticals can also like add like we have a fixed fee for trustless work like on escros, which is 3% and they can add an extra fee. So like. If they like they become the security deposits like product on top of us like they there is a huge business model to have. So like, that's why we're taking like such a small tiny cut. Because we want to provide like, that layer zero of infrastructure so, that all their products can come and build upon us and offer this functionality, which it's mostly like people have experimented with this. But it's mostly untested in a lot of niches use cases

[17:00] and verticals all around like every time I talk to someone I get like 10 ideas of things we can build back and yeah only s open source is the only way honestly do you have any idea. When you will actually go live on mainnet according to our seller Community Fund Grant around March April is what we want we're targeting for, that yeah we're still like version two of the contract is already like the API goes after, that and like we have all, that kind of flow H. So yeah I think it's really feasible by March yeah I think it's also quick, that's it's only like three four months away. So yeah part of the Community Fund Grant also has this auditing H. So I'm also looking forward for, that because, that would really like help and

[18:00] also, that's why open source makes a lot of sense. So as much eyes as possible own our contracts. And so on. So we get more feedback, which is one of the best validation techniques I think yeah I think. When when you're holding other people's funds the auditing part is super critical it's just having a third party verify your code go through your code and be able to say, that this, that our code and our solution has been audited by a third party I think it also builds a lot of trust. So yeah. So so yeah it's I think it's a great thing, that we have, that in as a part of our Community Fund program yeah it's really useful looking forward for, that okay great thank you so much it's always a pleasure to talk to you and it's super exciting to see

[19:00] you're making and what you're building on Stellar it's I think it's an inspiration for everyone in the community thank you for joining sure my pleasure talk to you later bye okay. And then let me see. Then as a part of the new format we're trying out here we'll try to do the presentations a little bit shorter. And then have maybe two or three presentations per time this time I we don't have a second presentation. But instead I am going to experiment with a little bit with some live coding I have been testing out some AI tools, that can assist you in building smart contracts on Stellar and I think it's interesting and seeing from the perspective, that. If you're new to building smart contracts in soran or on Stellar. Then then some of these tools

[20:00] can be a great help. So let's see. If I can share my screen I think it's loading here let see. If I can make it a little bit bigger yeah okay. So what I'm going to show here is just the hello world application the demo example app we have show how to run, that this inside cursor is an AI assisted IDE you can use for many different software language and just for the fun of it I tested it

[21:00] out not, that long time ago to see. Because I was pretty sure it's probably, that's probably not support for soran. But I to my surprise, that was actually pretty good support. So I'm just going to go through a very simple example of how you can use it and I think this might be very helpful. If you're new to developing on Stell soran. So so let's just give it a try it looks very much like other tools you are you're used to using the it the ID is pretty standard looking and I have a terminal and I will just try to set up the hello world smart contract. So let's try, that and let's call

[22:00] this okay. So what we have here is a new smart contract it's the hello world smart contract and we can try to open the code here and this is very much like what you're used to seeing in your IDE and we can do the same we can in other IDs. So let's just try to run this let's run a test oh I need to get into the right directory and it just takes a minute. And then it should hopefully run the test without any issues. While this is running the what I want to show here is I'm going to take this very simple smart contract. And then I'm going to add some function it to it what I want to

[23:00] do is I want to store the value to, that is provided by the caller the invoker and. If there is already a value stored and we are not providing a value. When we invoke the smart contract so. If two is empty. Then I'll just take the last value, that's a very simple smart contract. But but it actually shows a pretty a good example of what you're doing like. When you're messing around with code for the first time or. When you're. If you're very new to it. So let's try, that out. So first I want to store I can see it is already remembered what I've done before, that's it's not supposed to do, that. But what I do here in the IDE is, that I press command and K I'm using Macbook. So it's command. And then I

[24:00] write let's see let's say store to in storage. So I just type what I want to do. And then I click the generate button. And then it will make a suggestion and I can see, that this is not just some generic rust code this is actually soran code and I think this looks pretty good. So let's just accept, that. So so. Now we have a line here, that was generated by the AI, that stores the value from the string from two. When it's provided to our instant storage I can. Then say Okay I only want to use this storage

[25:00] if. If the two value here. When we invoke the smart contract. If there's no value here. Then I want to use the stored value from the first time we ran it. So so let's try to have it do, that again I press command and okay. And then let's just say and again I just describe it. If if two is empty use two from storage and let's see what it comes up with okay. So it actually initializes a new in new variable and it checks. If two is has a length, that's equal zero and. If it is. Then we get it from

[26:00] storage and. If not. Then we just return the one we got from the parameter from an invoking the smart contract this looks pretty good. So so let's just do, that and having this line of code here is actually fine. Because this. If if it's valid. Then we want to update the value in storage and. If it's just getting the same from before. If if two was empty. Then it's just restoring the same value so, that's, that's fine too. So so let's try to run this I'm not going to build and deploy it to test net I'm just going to use the test case and. If we go to test first I just want to store this so. If we see the test case here, that is provided it comes out of the box. When we create the smart contract

[27:00] then. Then we provide Dev as a string. When we invoke the contract. And then we check for it. If it contains Dev but. Because we also want to test for the case where there's not a string When we invoke it let's create the test case for, that as well oh and let's like make this mutable. And then we just add an empty string here so. When we run this. Because we ran this one first where we stored Dev the dev string in storage we should still get Dev. When we run this test even, though we don't provide a string here. So let's try to run this

[28:00] test there is an error. If we go back to the code here this way of setting what type of output we're getting is probably throwing an error. So let's just specify, that this is a string and let's see. If we can run it again okay. So it. Now completed so, that means, that first it both test cases here were passed the whole test file as a whole was completed and without errors so. When we provide Dev as a parameter first. When we invoke the contract we store, that in the storage. And then the second time we run it without the value and it

[29:00] still gets dep. Because it's pulling it from the storage. Now I know a little bit more about storage on in sorond. So I know, that this is instant storage there we have three different types of storage we have the temporary storage and we have the permanent storage. So is this the right one to use and, that's a neat little feature, that I can use I can actually ask the IDE. If this is the right. source to use. So I use command and L and let's just delete these. And then I can ask, which storage type should I

[30:00] use let's see what I get. So here we actually getting it says this is actually not a relevant example let's try to rephrase this is more a front end answer. If I ask is instance the right type seems like it's looking at seems it looking like I actually had it this is typical. When you do something

[31:00] live let's see explain soran storage types let's see what yeah this was a little bit more along the lines of what it returned. When I was testing it out. But but I can actually hear in the IDE ask what the different storage types are and it mentions instant storage persistent storage and temporary storage. And then it gives me an example of how to use it. And then it gives me some more information I have actually had it reply to me, that. Because of the smart contract the functionality, that I'm building here, that I had pick the right storage type, that instant storage would be the

[32:00] best type it was, that's what I was hoping it would show again. But but we can actually instead of having to go to documentation or go to other places to see and to learn more about it we can actually just use the chat and get some valuable feedback at least some of the times. So so yeah this was a quick example of how AI is going to help us build smart contracts as well I was really pleasantly surprised. When I saw, that it knows how to assist me. When I'm building smart contracts and I think it's a it's really relevant for especially developers who are new to seller new to soran, that they can get a little bit of help without leaving the ID. So so yeah I hope this was helpful and maybe you feel like trying it yourself I have just tried this tool it's cursor and it's a free version I'm using

[33:00] it's not an endorsement or anything it's just the one, that I happen to try out. But but yeah try to play with it and I think it's great fun and eventually I think it'll be it'll help me to get more productive. When I'm coding okay, that's, that's all I had for today I don't know. If there's any questions we can take questions. If if there is anything I see Chris has been very active answering questions and commenting as well

[34:00] yeah it's an interesting discussion okay. If if there's not anything else. Then thank you everyone for joining I hope this, that you like this format we will start we will continue to experiment and try different things and I think it's it looks like twitch is giving us a lot less technical issues than we've had in the past. When we've done these meetings on Discord. So so. So yeah we'll continue here and shortly we will send out and I'll share, that on Discord as well we'll have a sign up page where you can sign up for notifications so. When

[35:00] when we plan a new session and we go live you can get an email notification, that was one of the suggestions, that we got from the session we did where we talked about some of our plans and what we would like to do and was looking for feedback and we are working on setting up an email list. So so you can subscribe to, that and get notifications. When when we have a new planned meeting. So so thank you everyone for joining we'll see you in a week bye
