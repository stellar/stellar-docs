1. SDF Data team gave a crash course in analysis of Stellar data, and covered how to access Hubble, tips for efficient querying, and how to get started with data exploration.
2. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QsCwFLFcDF4RmNIwtSSnNrUfZb0RM0kLxOOxC7ENY5M) are publicly available and legible async. The deck is a “Crash Course in Data Analysis” that walks through logging into Hubble (BigQuery), joining the `crypto-stellar` dataset, and best practices for querying large tables.

- Use the Hubble docs’ Connecting/End-to-End sections, star the `crypto-stellar` project, and prefer the UI’s schema/preview tabs before running expensive SQL.
- Avoid `SELECT *`, filter by partitioned/clustered columns (e.g., `batch_run_date` or `closed_at`), and limit unnecessary joins so queries stay fast and cheap.
- Treat each analysis like a mystery: define the objective, understand Stellar’s protocol data, and lean on the Discord [`#hubble` channel](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1214961876253933649) when you hit roadblocks.

3. Tips for data anlaysis are also covered in [docs](/docs/data/analytics/hubble/analyst-guide)
4. Share your queries and post questions in #hubble in Stellar discord, which is a dedicated channel for data-related topics.
