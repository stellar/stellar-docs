## [Public Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/897514728459468821/1259997651995332653)

The SDF Data team delivered a practical introduction to analyzing Stellar network data, aimed at developers and analysts looking to explore on-chain activity more effectively. The session focused on how to get started with Hubble, Stellar’s BigQuery-based analytics platform, and how to approach large datasets efficiently.

In addition to tooling walkthroughs, the discussion emphasized analysis best practices—from understanding protocol-level data structures to writing cost-effective queries—and highlighted community resources available for ongoing support.

### Key Topics

- Overview of Stellar data analysis using Hubble (BigQuery)
- Getting Started
  - Logging into Hubble and joining the `crypto-stellar` dataset
  - Using the UI’s schema and preview tools before running full SQL queries
- Querying Best Practices
  - Avoiding `SELECT *` on large tables
  - Filtering by partitioned or clustered columns such as `batch_run_date` and `closed_at`
  - Minimizing unnecessary joins to keep queries fast and inexpensive
- Analytical Mindset
  - Framing each analysis with a clear objective
- Building Support
  - Sharing queries and asking questions in the dedicated Discord channel for data-related topics
