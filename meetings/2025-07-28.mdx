In this meeting we are talking to Esteban and Francisco from PaltaLabs. Stellar Hacks is currently running a hackathon in collaboration with PaltaLabs, where the goal is to build using their projects Soroswap and DeFindex.

Let's see how the hackathon is going, and some advice if you are still considering entering, there's still time to enter!
