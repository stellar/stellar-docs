- hello everyone and welcome to the stellar open protocol discussion um so in these meetings we discuss core advancement proposals aka caps these are technical specs that suggest changes to the stellar protocol necessary to allow the protocol to continue to evolve to meet the needs of the ecosystem and we live stream these meetings so that anyone who's interested in watching they can follow along although i do want to know it is a technical discussion so if you are watching you may want to take a look at the caps themselves and they're linked to in the show description um also we do keep an eye on the discussion box and your comments there they do help us inform our decisions going forward today's discussion will focus on two caps and our goal is really as as it is generally in these meetings to try to resolve some outstanding questions about them so we may not address questions that you ask directly um but if some relevant ones come in i may actually try to incorporate them into the conversation so as i said we are focusing on caps and this meeting is just part of the cap life cycle so generally caps are discussed on the stellar depth mailing list there's a link to that mailing list in the event description for anyone who's interested in joining the discussion um then caps are drafted and iterated on based on feedback and suggestions and they end up here in this protocol meeting and based on what happens in this meeting they may be put up for a vote by the cap committee who decides whether or not to accept a rejected cap which point they move into final comment period so there's everyone has a last chance to raise questions on the stellar debt mailing list and if it makes it through final comment period a cap is implemented into a major stellar core release then there's still one final step which is that every major release every protocol upgrade is voted on by the validators and has to be accepted before it's applied to the network and so all of that is to say this is a long process where there's a lot of public participation and ultimately the network decides to accept major protocol changes so enough preamble today we are discussing cap 21 and cap 40.
- um both of these lay the groundwork for building payment channels on stellar so payment channels they allow multiple parties to securely transact off chain and periodically settle on chain and among other things that could make it easier to build high volume use cases on stellar so if today's discussion seems dense at any point keep that in mind these caps make technical changes geared towards payment channels and payment channels are important for scaling network throughput so without further ado we will look at the actual caps we're going to start by talking about cap 21.

On July 29, 2021, the Stellar Development Foundation hosted "Open Protocol Discussion (7/29/2021)", a discussion for the global community. Builders traded notes on Open, Protocol, and Discussion.

Key discussion threads:

- Open anchored the discussion as speakers compared real-world examples.
- Practical demos highlighted how Protocol applies to Stellar builders.
- Attendees outlined next steps around Discussion for upcoming releases.
