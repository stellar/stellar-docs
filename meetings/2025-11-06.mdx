Christian Santagata walked through OpenZeppelin’s three Q3 releases for Soroban and how they layer new UX, composability, and compliance tooling onto the Stellar stack.

The Smart Account framework pushes account abstraction into the default developer workflow so passkey-first and programmable authorization flows feel native. Signers, scopes, policies, and validity windows combine into “context rules” (up to 15 per account) so assets can be governed by friendly policies rather than rigid key lists. Delegated signers cover Soroban addresses via `require_auth_for_args`, external signers route through verifier contracts so new curves can be added without redeploying core logic, and even the policies themselves can be external, stateful modules. That enables use cases like multisig automation, subscription payment windows, AI/bot guardrails, and short-lived dApp sessions—while the community pushed for clearer naming and demo content to ease onboarding.

Vault introduces an ERC-4626-style yield interface so managed strategies share a single, predictable API. Deposits mint shares proportional to assets under management, redemptions burn them, and yield accrues by increasing assets-per-share. OpenZeppelin highlighted the rounding pitfalls that let “inflation attacks” steal value via donations plus zero-share mints, then showed how a decimal offset and consistent round-down/round-up rules neutralize the exploit. GS Maxi (Sentinel F) contributed heavily to the spec, which was merged during the call.

The RWA stack packages a base compliant token with reusable identity and compliance layers. Core token features include forced transfers, freeze (whole or partial), recovery flows for lost keys, and pausability. Identity is claim-based by default—trusted issuers sign residency/KYC topics (capped at 15) but teams can swap in ZK or Merkle-based attestations. Compliance logic hooks into pre/post transfer, create, or destroy events, and multiple module contracts can monitor the same hook so banks can share rule sets. Access control can stay simple (owner) or fan out into granular roles, and extensions such as Document Manager anchor off-chain legal artifacts via hashes.
