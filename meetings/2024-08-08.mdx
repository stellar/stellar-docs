## [Public Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/897514728459468821/1270154917432131686)

The session introduces Zephyr as a runtime environment built on top of the Mercury indexer, with a focus on how it can simplify common patterns in decentralized application development. Rather than interacting directly with lower-level indexing and data-fetching logic, developers can rely on Zephyr to provide more ergonomic access to indexed data.

Through examples and discussion, the talk highlights how pairing Zephyr with Mercury can reduce boilerplate, abstract away indexing and data-access complexity, speed up iteration, and make it easier to reason about application state when building on Stellar’s ecosystem.

### Key Topics

- What Zephyr is:
  - Mercury’s cloud execution environment powered by the `ZephyrVM`
  - A hosted, serverless runtime for custom indexing and data workflows
- When to use Zephyr vs predefined Mercury indexing:
  - Zephyr for fully custom APIs, aggregations, bots, alerts, and simulations
  - Built-in Mercury patterns for simpler event or contract indexing
- Zephyr execution model:
  - Compiled Rust programs running in a sandboxed WebAssembly VM
  - Direct access to Stellar ledger data and ledger close metadata
  - No need to run or maintain Stellar nodes
- Capabilities enabled by Zephyr:
  - Custom database schemas and queries
  - Multi-step data processing and aggregations
  - External web requests and integrations
  - Contract calls and simulation
  - Serverless, callable APIs (custom RPC-like endpoints)
- Mercury Cloud vs mapping-based indexers:
  - Lower-level and more granular data access
  - Ability to tap into external services
  - More flexible than handler-style workflows
- Soroban integration:
  - Built-in Soroban host support inside the ZephyrVM
  - Use of Soroban SDK primitives directly from Zephyr programs
  - Easier handling of Soroban contract data structures
- ZephyrVM details:
  - Sandboxed execution of untrusted code
  - Specialized tooling to simplify indexer development
  - Designed to support indexing, monitoring, bots, and alerts
- Extensibility and roadmap:
  - Ongoing development with community-driven feature requests
  - Issue tracking via the Zephyr toolkit repository
