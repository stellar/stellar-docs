1. [`@Soiled`](https://discord.com/users/603296640568393746) and [`@Robeart`](https://discord.com/users/226635735350902785) from Orbit spoke about using Blend to create decentralized stablecoins for all currencies under the Orbit Protocol, utilizing a decentralized pegkeeper to maintain their price, and leveraging these stablecoins and smart wallets to create an orderbook less perpetual exchange, bringing Forex to Stellar

2.[Link to the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mDOrBLfe8-Bq6VCy7r5bb4w_uZjq-EOorbV3ZwYfs1k) which lays out Orbit’s Blend-native protocol for collateralized debt positions denominated in many currencies and the Hermes liquidity layer, including the approach to keep the peg, use smart wallets, and launch a Forex-focused perpetual exchange.

- Orbit builds on Blend so issuers can mint stablecoins for many local currencies, keep reserves in their home markets, and reduce FX/remittance costs by up to ~80% while improving financial inclusion.
- Hermes manages peg parameters, fee schedules, and treasury routing while ensuring safe withdrawals, balanced deposits, and multi-currency leverage, with DAO-controlled pegkeeper settings.
- The combined Orbit+Hermes stack pushes decentralized Forex, on-chain yield, and smart-wallet UX, though it requires careful handling of liquidity, interest-rate tuning, and trustline/setup complexity.

The hosts microphone audio is not in the video so there is some silence during Q/A. Here are the question asked during the Q/A:

1. ([From `@markus_0_`](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/911254664576643122/1273737455413100686)) why do you always have an infinite amount of tokens in the pool? Wouldn't it be safer to start small and mint more as demand opens up
2. ([From HunterIonize](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/911254664576643122/1273740952632299521)) What purpose does this serve exactly? Sorry to be blunt
3. How do you see the Orbit Protocol contributing to financial inclusion on a global scale, particularly in underbanked regions? What challenges do you anticipate in achieving this?
4. In 5-10 years, how do you see the landscape of Forex on blockchain evolving? What role do you believe Stellar will play in this evolution, and how will Blend and Orbit Protocol be at the forefront?
5. Are there any asks of the developer community?
