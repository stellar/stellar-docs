The Platform team presented Galexie as a core component of the Composable Data Platform (CDP), focusing on how developers can build flexible, end-to-end data pipelines on top of Stellar ledger data. The demo highlighted how raw network data can be efficiently extracted and prepared for downstream analytics or application use.

The discussion emphasized composability: teams can mix and match storage backends, transformation steps, and execution modes (batch or streaming) to suit different workloads, from historical analysis to near-real-time data feeds.

### Key Topics

1. Galexie
   1. Data Extraction: Extracts raw ledger data from the Stellar network
   2. Compression: Compresses raw data for efficient storage
   3. Storage Options: Supports runtime configuration through the Datastore abstraction to use various physical storage layers, starting with Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
   4. Operating Modes: can run in batch mode or streaming mode
2. Composable Data Platform
   1. Flexible Datastore: Multiple options for physical data storage layers
   2. Galexie: Used to extract, compress and export data to your chosen Datastore
   3. Transform: Structure data in a model suitable to your application
3. Pluggable Data Pipelines
   1. Workflows: Create ETL(extract, transform, load) pipelines
   2. Streaming: Fast, lightweight streaming data
