  title: Stellar Disbursement Platform API
  version: ''
  description: The Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP) is a tool built for organizations to make bulk payments to a group of recipients over the Stellar network. You can read more about using the SDP [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/category/use-the-stellar-disbursement-platform).

  - name: Authentication
    description: Authentication endpoints control the login, token refresh, and password management processes for SDP users.
  - name: Disbursements
    description: Endpoints related to disbursements. A disbursement is a group of payments sent to multiple individuals at once. An SDP user with the appropriate role triggers a new disbursement through the SDP dashboard by uploading a list of receivers and amounts. When the receiver has linked their wallet to the SDP, the payment automatically begins. SDP users can track their disbursements in real-time through the SDP dashboard. Each disbursement must have a unique name defined by the organization.
  - name: Payments
    description: Endpoints related to payments. An SDP payment is an individual payment from an organization to a receiver. Each payment is part of a disbursement and occurs on the Stellar network. Granular payment status is stored in the SDP database and can be viewed in real-time on the SDP dashboard. There is no POST endpoint because submitting payments to the Stellar network is handled by the Transaction Submission Service (TSS).
  - name: Receivers
    description: |-
      Endpoints related to receivers. A receiver is an individual receiving a payment in a disbursement. The receiver is tracked by phone number to reduce the need for personally identifiable information. Each receiver must be unique within the disbursement.  

      Each receiver will have at least one wallet associated with them. The wallet public key will remain null until the receiver registers with a wallet provider and links the wallet to the SDP through SEP-24. Receivers must verify their identity through that process, which requires the SDP to store verification information on receivers like date of birth, national ID number, or personal PIN. This information can be updated by the organization through the receiver endpoints.
  - name: Statistics
    description: Statistics endpoints return general aggregated data per organization, as well as disbursement-specific metrics. SDP users can use this data to monitor their disbursements over time.
  - name: Registration
    description: |-
      The registration endpoints guide the process for a receiver to verify their identity and link their wallet address to an SDP.  

      The registration process only needs to happen once per receiver to link their wallet. Only SDP-compatible wallet providers can facilitate the registration process. These endpoints must be supported and hit by the wallet providers after the receiver gets the initial SMS invite. After the wallet address is successfully linked, the payment automatically begins.  

      The SDP<>wallet registration process uses SEP-10, SEP-24, and deep links. Please see the SDP [developer docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/category/use-the-stellar-disbursement-platform) for a full set of instructions for wallet providers to become SDP-compatible.
  - name: Profile
    description: 'Profiles endpoints manage the process of getting and updating individual profile information. Profile information is set when the account is created and can be updated by the user on the SDP dashboard Profile page. Note: profiles never refer to receivers of funds.'
  - name: Organization
    description: Organization endpoints manage the process of getting and updating organizational profile information. The organization’s profile has basic information set at the time of SDP deployment. It can be modified by the Owner. Organizations can also manage their preferences, like which assets to use, through these endpoints.
  - name: Users
    description: The users endpoints facilitate the creation of new SDP users–including setting the appropriate role, sending an email invitation, and activating a user–and managing roles.
  - name: Admin
    description: The Admin API oversees the management of tenants within the system, facilitating tasks such as provisioning new tenants, updating their information, and retrieving tenant data.

        The deposit endpoint allows a wallet to get deposit information from an anchor,  so a user has all the information needed to initiate a deposit. 
        It also lets the anchor specify additional information that the user must submit interactively via a popup or embedded browser window to be able to deposit.  Please check the detailed documentation [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#deposit-2).

      summary: Default Tenant
      description: |
        Sets the tenant specified in the request body as the default one, resolving all the incoming API request to that tenant when the env `SINGLE_TENANT_MODE` is set to true. Once set, the default tenant can be overwritten but never unset, although it is only effective when `SINGLE_TENANT_MODE` is set to true.

        Default tenant is useful for development purposes or when the SDP is used by a single organization. This allows the organization to skip specifying the tenant in every request and simplifies the SDP setup operationally by removing the need of providing wildcard TLS certificates for multi-tenant configurations.
