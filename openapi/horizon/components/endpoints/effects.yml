      summary: List All Effects
      description: "This endpoint lists all effects and can be used in streaming mode. Streaming mode allows you to listen for new effects as they are added to the Stellar ledger. If called in streaming mode, Horizon will start at the earliest known effect unless a cursor is set, in which case it will start from that cursor. By setting the cursor value to now, you can stream effects created since your request time."
