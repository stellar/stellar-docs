      summary: List All Payments
      description: "This endpoint lists all Successful payment-related operations and can be used in streaming mode. Streaming mode allows you to listen for new payments as they are added to the Stellar ledger. If called in streaming mode, Horizon will start at the earliest known payment unless a cursor is set, in which case it will start from that cursor. By setting the cursor value to now, you can stream payments created since your request time. Operations that can be returned by this endpoint include: create_account, payment, path_payment_strict_recieve, path_payment_strict_send, and account_merge ."
