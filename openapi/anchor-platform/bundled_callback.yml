    The Synchronous Callbacks API specification for the Stellar Anchor Platform project.

    The Synchronous Callbacks API defines requests made by the Platform while it is processing a request from a client application. The
    anchor's responses to these requests affect the Platform responses to the client application.

        If the platform is configured with `depositInfoGeneratorType: api`, the Platform make this request to
        the Anchor backend every time a transaction is initiated by a client application.

        The Anchor must guarantee that the memo returned in this request is unique, so it can be mapped 1-to-1 to a Platform
        resource such as a [SEP-31](https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-31) transaction.

        Here is how this flow would be used for Receiving Anchors that need to create their unique `(account, memo)` pairs
        outside the platform, using Circle:

        request and response defined in SEP-12.

        This endpoint allows clients to:

          1. Fetch the fields the server requires in order to register a new customer via a SEP-12
        [`PUT /customer`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md#customer-put) request

        If the server does not have a customer registered for the parameters sent in the request, it should return the
        fields required in the response. The same response should be returned when no parameters are sent.

          2. Check the status of a customer that may already be registered

        This allows clients to check whether the customers information was accepted, rejected, or still needs more info.
        If the server still needs more info, or the server needs updated information, it should return the fields required.

        The request and response for this endpoint are identical to the
        [`PUT /customer`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md#customer-put)
        request and response defined in SEP-12.

        Client applications make requests with the following request body, which is forwarded to the anchor. Anchors
        must validate and persist the data passed, and return the customer's `id`. Requests containing only string fields will
        be forwarded to the anchor as with the `application/json` content type. Requests containing
        binary fields will be forwarded to the anchor as with the `multipart/form-data` content type.
