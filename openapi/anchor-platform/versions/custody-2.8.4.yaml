  title: Custody Server
  description: |
    The custody server connects to enterprise wallet providers, such as Fireblocks, to send and receive payments for transactions initiated via the Anchor Platform. This service is an alternative to the Stellar Observer for businesses who use one of the supported providers. In addition to the functionality offered by the Stellar Observer, the Custody Server can also facilitate outbound payments to client's Stellar accounts. If you also use the events service, payments to your accounts will trigger a HTTP callback made to your business server.

    If you already have an integration with your wallet provider, then this component is not required, although your business server will need to notify the Anchor Platform when a payment associated with an Anchor Platform transaction was sent to or from your Stellar accounts via the Platform API.

    Currently the only supported provider is Fireblocks.
