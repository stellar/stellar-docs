      summary: Update Transactions Info
      operationId: patchTransactions
      description:
        Accepts one or more objects containing updated information on transactions. Note that requests containing
        invalid data for any transaction will result in a 400 Bad Request and no transactions will be updated. 
        Importantly, this operation is NOT atomic. If one update fails, all previous updates would be applied, 
        all subsequent updates would be discarded, and an error would be raised.

# CHANGELOG
## v2.0.0: Simplified the Event by merging the QuoteEvent and Transaction Event and embedding the detail in the `transaction` and `quote` field. Removed unused schemas.
