      description:
        Accepts one or more objects containing updated information on transactions. Note that requests containing
        invalid data for any transaction will result in a 400 Bad Request and no transactions will be updated. 
        Importantly, this operation is NOT atomic. If one of updates fail, all previous updates would be applied, 
        all subsequent updates would be discarded, and an error would be raised. Note that this endpoint accepts a 
        subset of transaction information defined in the `MutableTransaction` schema.
