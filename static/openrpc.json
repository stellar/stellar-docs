It should also be used by backend Dapp components to \"ingest\" events into their own database for querying and serving.\n\nIf making multiple requests, clients should deduplicate any events received, based on the event's unique id field.

      "description": "The getTransaction method provides details about the specified transaction. Clients are expected to periodically query this method to ascertain when a transaction has been successfully recorded on the blockchain. The soroban-rpc system maintains a restricted history of recently processed transactions, with the default retention window set at 1440 ledgers, approximately equivalent to a 2-hour timeframe. For private soroban-rpc instances, it is possible to modify the retention window value by adjusting the transaction-retention-window configuration setting. For comprehensive debugging needs that extend beyond the 2-hour timeframe, it is advisable to retrieve transaction information from Horizon, as it provides a lasting and persistent record.",
