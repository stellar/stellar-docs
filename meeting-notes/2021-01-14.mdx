The first protocol call of 2021 focused on the regulatory tooling that issuers need on Stellar. The group walked through CAP-0029 (AllowTrust when `auth_required` is unset) and CAP-0035 (asset clawback) to make sure token issuers can enforce blacklists, reverse fraudulent transfers, and recover accounts without surprising end users.

Key discussion threads:

- Why CAP-0029 lets issuers authorize or revoke trustlines even after they toggle their account flags, so migrating from restricted to unrestricted issuance (and vice versa) does not strand wallets.
- CAP-0035’s proposed flags and operations for clawing back balances—including claimable balances—and how those primitives satisfy transfer-agent obligations and global regulatory requirements.
- Regulatory context from partners working with the SEC and other agencies, emphasizing “opt-in” assets, transparent metadata, and the roles that transfer agents and record keepers would play when clawbacks are invoked.
