With Protocol 18 ready for a validator vote, this call reviewed the final tweaks to CAP-0038 (the AMM proposal that ultimately shipped). The team revisited every outstanding change request—authority revocation, limit enforcement, result codes, and rounding behavior—to make sure the merged implementation behaved just like offers on the orderbook.

Key discussion threads:

- Aligning pool operations with offer semantics: liquidity providers must always be able to withdraw shares, even if their trustline becomes unauthorized, and deposits/withdrawals now emit clearer result codes when slippage or limits are hit.
- Guardrails for issuer actions: when assets are revoked, pool positions unwind predictably and cannot get stuck in “unwithdrawable” states, even if a price swings violently between the deposit and redemption.
- Pre-flight reminders for builders: install Protocol-18-compatible releases of Stellar Core, Horizon, and the SDKs before the November 3 validator vote, because the AMM functionality includes breaking changes across the stack.
