This session kicked off the automated market maker (AMM) effort. Two competing drafts—CAP-0037 and CAP-0038—were presented, each aiming to combine Stellar’s orderbook with constant-product pools so anyone can supply or consume liquidity without standing orders.

Key discussion threads:

- Resource management and fee economics: who sponsors the pool accounts, how LP share trustlines should be charged reserves, and how to prevent “free riding” from contracts that never post reserves.
- DEX integration strategies: CAP-0037’s “always take the best marginal price” routing versus CAP-0038’s deterministic sequencing of pool and orderbook fills, plus the UX consequences of hiding the routing details behind path payments.
- Pool operations (deposit/withdraw rounding, claimable incentives, slippage protections) and the plan for continuing the debate on the developer mailing list before either draft moves forward.
