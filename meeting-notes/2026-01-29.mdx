## Protocol Discussion

We have one new CAP to discuss and that is CAP-80. This proposal adds BN254 Multi-Scalar Multiplication and modular arithmetic used in a variety of ZK proof applications. Adding host support for these will greatly improve the performance of these use cases.

We also follow up on a previous CAP - the CAP-73.

Read more about the proposal here:
