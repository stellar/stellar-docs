Justin Rice hosted the first livestreamed protocol call, starting with a protocol-13 update (the validator vote slipped two weeks so exchanges could finish testing) and moving into the protocol-14 backlog. CAP-23’s claimable balances are headed to final comment, giving wallets a way to separate payment senders from recipients.

CAP-33’s sponsored reserves dominated the rest of the conversation—how wallets will coordinate the handshake, how sequence numbers complicate `create_account`, and why we may need a broader fix for delegated signing. The group closed with process talk: forming working groups, documenting downstream impact (Horizon/SDK), and tightening network-upgrade comms.

Key discussion threads:

- `Protocol 13` upgrade vote pushed to late June so exchanges can deploy; plan for better upgrade runbooks and readiness checks.
- `CAP-23` claimable balances (two operations, unclaimed funds go to the fee pool) ready for final-comment review.
- `CAP-33` sponsored reserves, handshake requirements, and the need for a general solution to sequence-number delegation.
- `Process` improvements: clarify working groups, capture Horizon/SDK impact per CAP, and keep ecosystem stakeholders informed throughout upgrades.
