A Core Dev, Dima, discussed the proposal to add constructor support to Soroban, Stellar's smart contract system.

Relevant links: [Draft CAP](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/50dde0611440d6dc562a33462e6ba5f1504b2753/core/cap-0058.md), [Ongoing discussion](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1501), [Motivating Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1067534037310255225)

Key points discussed:

1. The proposal improves usability of Soroban for contract and SDK developers. A constructor guarantees contract initialization thus reducing overhead contract code that's usually added to ensure initialization.
2. There was general agreement for the proposal, questions were primarily implementation-focused like whether constructors should handle arguments, what should happen with upgrades, backwards comptability with contract creation functions, and behaviour on wasm update.
3. The high impact topic of naming is put to ecosystem vote, please cast yours [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1507).
