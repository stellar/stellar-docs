On April 15, 2021, the Stellar Development Foundation hosted "NFTs on Stellar", a community session for the global community. Builders traded notes on Nfts, Theres, and Youre.

all right all right all right here we are finally the uh the stellar round table on uh on nft so we are going to talk about non-fungible tokens today i will admit it wasn't that long ago before i thought this had something to do with mushrooms or fungus i didn't know what a fungible or non-fungible token was that was definitely one of my most earliest google queries back when i was first getting introduced to this concept

Key discussion threads:

- Nfts anchored the community session as speakers compared real-world examples.
- Practical demos highlighted how Theres applies to Stellar builders.
- Attendees outlined next steps around Youre for upcoming releases.
