<b>Part 1</b>

RampMeDaddy will be joining us for this Stellar Developer Meeting. RampMeDaddy
is currently participating in the Stellar x Draper Embark Program, and we ask
what the team is up to, learn more about what they are building and a casual
chat about how they are building their dapp on Stellar/Soroban.
