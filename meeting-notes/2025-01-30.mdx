RampMeDaddy will be joining us for this Stellar Developer Meeting. RampMeDaddy is currently participating in the Stellar x Draper Embark Program, and we ask what the team is up to, learn more about what they are building and a casual chat about how they are building their dapp on Stellar/Soroban.<br />
