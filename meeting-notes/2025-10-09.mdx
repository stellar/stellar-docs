## OpenZeppelin UI Builder demo

We are meeting with the OpenZeppelin team again to catch up on the latest developer tooling work they are doing.

This time Steve will demo UI Builder, an easy way to spin up a front-end for any contract call in seconds. UI Builder allows you to select a function and then it auto-generates a React UI with wallet connect and multi-network support, and exports a complete app.

## Protocol Discussion

In this Core Advancement Proposal discussion CAP-0075 (Host functions for enabling Poseidon and Poseidon2 hash functions) is presented.

This CAP proposes adding host functions for cryptographic primitives enabling Poseidon family of hash functions, which are widely-adopted hash choices in efficient zero-knowledge proof systems. Supporting these as host functions in Soroban can facilitate adoption of ZK applications and interoperability with other ecosystems.
