With Soroban live on Futurenet, the team revisited CAP-0046-06-the built-in token contract that maps Stellar's classic asset semantics onto Soroban. Siddharth outlined the latest changes, including clearer admin functions (mint, burn, clawback) and the ability to reflect issuer metadata such as decimals or home domains.

Much of the discussion centered on `auth_required` assets. They debated whether new holders should start deauthorized, how to keep authorization state mirrored between classic trustlines and contract balances, and how clawbacks should look when a contract holds pooled funds. Getting those semantics right keeps anchors confident that Soroban will not bypass compliance controls they rely on today.

Key discussion threads:

- The updated built-in token contract interface for minting, burning, freezing, and clawing back balances while tracking issuer metadata.
- Handling `auth_required`: default authorization state, how issuers reauthorize accounts, and how that state propagates through Soroban.
- Ensuring clawback, freeze, and metadata updates remain consistent when a contract wraps a classic trustline or manages pooled balances.
