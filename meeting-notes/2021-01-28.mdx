This follow-up meeting stayed locked on CAP-0035 as the authors addressed questions raised during the prior call’s Q&A. The team reviewed the optional nature of the new clawback flags, the proposed `set_trust_line_flags` operation, and the expectations for discoverability so wallets can warn users before they opt into a clawback-enabled asset.

Key discussion threads:

- Community clarification that clawback is strictly opt-in per asset: issuers must set the new flag before a holder accepts an asset, and explorers can surface that metadata so no one is surprised after the fact.
- Why `set_trust_line_flags` mirrors `set_options`, letting issuers clear individual bits (like clawback) without redefining the other authorization flags on an account.
- Remaining implementation concerns: reserve management, how claimable balances inherit flags, and the process for moving CAP-0035 into Final Comment Period before it lands in Stellar Core.
