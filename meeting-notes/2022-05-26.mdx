The agenda stacked three Jump-Cannon caps: CAP-0053 (Smart Contract Data), CAP-0052 (Smart Contract Interactions, minimal), and an updated CAP-0047 (contract lifecycle). Grady explained how CAP-0053 formalizes persistent data by reusing the CAP-0046 type system while introducing the notion of read/write footprints so Core knows which ledger keys a transaction plans to touch before execution.

John then summarized CAP-0052's low-level host functions for invoking contracts and enumerating their read/write sets, and Siddharth walked through CAP-0047's refreshed deploy/update/delete flows that keep ledger metadata tidy. Together these caps round out the primitives Soroban needs before higher-level features like events and fees land.

Key discussion threads:

- CAP-0053's ledger schema: typed contract data entries, how long-lived storage ties back to CAP-0046, and why footprints must be explicit.
- CAP-0052's minimal interaction surface and the guarantees it provides about deterministic host calls and read/write declarations.
- CAP-0047 updates that clarify how contracts are created, versioned, and removed so Core can garbage-collect metadata safely.
