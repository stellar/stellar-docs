Justin Rice restarted the public protocol calls and focused on two pillars for Protocol 14: CAP-23 (claimable balances) and CAP-33 (sponsored reserves). CAP-23’s sticking point was the predicate-tree shape—how deep should `and/or` nesting go, how do we bound recursion in XDR, and should we allow duplicate claimants—so the group agreed to hash out an implementation-friendly limit on the mailing list.

CAP-33 conversations centered on downstream effects (SEP-30, Horizon, SDKs) and naming the new operations so wallet devs understand the sandwich flow. The call closed with cap 34 (close-time semantics), sequence-number gaps, and how to coordinate Horizon/SDK work as part of the upgrade checklist.

Key discussion threads:

- CAP-23 predicate trees: recursion limits, disjunctive-normal-form proposal, and whether to enforce a fixed depth for claim predicates.
- CAP-33 sponsored reserves: renaming operations (`begin/end/revoke`), making SEP-30 compatible, and outlining the Horizon/SDK work.
- Protocol 14 readiness: tracking downstream tasks in GitHub issues, building FG/FAQ docs, and ensuring the ecosystem knows about the upgrade plan.
- Follow-up discussions slated for the dev mailing list (predicate changes, close-time semantics, sequence-number ideas).

okay we're live alright everyone welcome to the open protocol discussion a biweekly meeting in which we review and plan for upcoming changes then provements do the stuff call we've missed a few meetings because people have been out of town but our plan is to keep live-streaming these so that the world at large anyone who's watching can see what we're working on and all the wonderful thoughts that you have about I don't like stellar better these meetings
