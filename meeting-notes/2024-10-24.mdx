SDF’s Platform team had an internal hackathon last week, with the purpose of building applications utilizing the [Composable Data Platform (CDP)](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/composable-data-platform). In this week’s developer meeting some of the team members present their projects. The apps are widely varied (trading app, fraud detection, JS browser-based ingester, etc) but the intent here is to show how easy CDP is to use.

Projects presented in the meeting:

1. Trade Aggregations Service
2. Deceptiscan - CDP fraud detection
3. Composable Data Platform Hackies - data indexer, payment indexer, contract expiration alerter, data indexes in DuckDB, torrents for data indexes and ledger metadata)
4. Data ingest with frontend JS
5. Real-time analytics
