Most of this call pitted CAP-0048 against CAP-0049-the two competing proposals for how classic assets should show up inside Soroban. John Carter walked through the wrap/unwrap approach where each trustline can escrow balances into a canonical contract, mint an ERC-20-like representation, and track allowances there without touching classic machinery except at the boundary.

Once the mechanics were clear the team evaluated compliance semantics. Issuers still need to enforce `auth_required`, clawbacks, and freezes after a balance crosses into a contract, and the CAPs propose lightweight helper functions so contracts can mirror those controls. Getting that mapping right will decide whether anchors feel safe moving volume into Soroban on day one.

Key discussion threads:

- How CAP-0048's per-asset wrapper contract compares to CAP-0049's adapter model, and how wallets locate the canonical contract ID for any asset.
- The ledger objects introduced by wrap/unwrap-trustlines, wrapable balances, and minted token balances-and how they stay in sync.
- Ensuring issuer controls (auth, revocation, clawback) survive the trip through Soroban so regulated anchors are not locked out of smart contracts.
