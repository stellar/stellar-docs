The year closed with a deep dive on "Soroban Auth Next." Dima walked through the pain points of today's invoker model-every contract has to roll its own signature verification, cross-contract approvals are messy, and wallets cannot easily sign complex call graphs. The proposed solution rethinks authentication so it is both general-purpose and extensible.

The heart of the design is an account-abstraction layer: every address points to an account contract that knows how to verify signatures (classic, multi-sig, hardware, or something new) and authorize actions on behalf of that address. On top of that sits a standardized invocation payload that lets users sign one structured document describing an entire call tree, making multi-hop Soroban transactions feasible.

Key discussion threads:

- Requirements for the new auth layer: general, composable, wallet-friendly, and able to span different signature schemes.
- Account abstraction where each address delegates signature checking to an account contract, enabling rich multi-sig or programmable wallets.
- Standardized invocation payloads that capture entire call graphs so a single signature can bless nested contract calls without bespoke SDK glue.
