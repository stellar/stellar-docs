Agenda: [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/900374272751591424/1278045556211716171)

CAP Core team deliberated on the proposed CAPs:

1. Addition of a constructor to Soroban's flavor of Rust. [CAP](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0058.md)
     1. Team's concern was about potential break in compatibility, which Dima had addressed. There were no further concerns.
3. Addition of BLS12-381 curve and required field arithmetics - [CAP](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0059.md)
     1. Team's concern was about providing functions to check invalid input. It's too computationally expensive to do the check at the contract layer so the it may need to be implemented as a host function. Jay is seeking ecosystem input around use cases that require strict input validation.
     2. There were no further concerns.
5. Increase performance by upgrading Soroban's VM. [CAP Discussion](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0060.md)
     1. Team's comments were about accuracy of the measurement method but the demonstrated benefits of wall clock time were thought to be promising.
     2. There was a suggestion to expose performance improvements to contract developers thus creating the incentive to optimize contracts to leverage the improvements.
     3. There were no further concerns.
