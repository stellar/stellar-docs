The meeting opened with Siddharth's addendum to CAP-0051: contracts now get a formal logging primitive. Logs will be hashed into the transaction meta (alongside the result) and there is even a proposal for error-only logs so wallets can avoid noise. That sparked a debate about how Horizon or light clients should index events-Bloom filters, opt-in filtering, or layered RPC streams.

Nicolas then debuted CAP-0055, the Soroban fee model. Compute, ledger reads, writes, and storage rent each receive their own buckets, and validators will publish price brackets so wallets can estimate the minimum bid for a given resource profile. The call surfaced questions about throttling, congestion control, and how to keep the minimum fee from being gamed.

Key discussion threads:

- Adding contract logs to CAP-0051's host functions, hashing them into transaction meta, and deciding when error-only logs make sense.
- Strategies for filtering events (Bloom filters vs Horizon streams) so app developers are not forced to ingest the entire meta stream.
- Breaking Soroban fees into compute, memory, footprint, and rent components while still exposing a simple interface to wallets.
