This session started with a rapid-fire clean-up of the Jump Cannon caps: they agreed to drop the unused `Box` object from CAP-0046, deferred any delegation helpers until the base model ships, and made sure the host/guest boundary is as small as possible. Grady also previewed a CAP-0053 amendment that formalizes a `footprint` type so transactions can declare the ledger keys they plan to read and write.

After the housekeeping the room zeroed in on asset interoperability again. Engineers compared requirements for single versus dual balances, how allowances should be stored, and whether contracts should ever need a trustline. The debate set the stage for the July design summit on asset representation.

Key discussion threads:

- Removing stale concepts (like `Box`) from CAP-0046 and resisting the urge to add delegation features before the base runtime lands.
- Extending CAP-0053 with an explicit `footprint` type for read/write sets so tooling and validators can reason about state access.
- Rearticulating interoperability requirements: reserves, allowances, issuer controls, and how much of that should be enforced via trustlines.
