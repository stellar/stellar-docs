CAP-0021 resurfaced with a fresh draft that extends transaction preconditions beyond simple timebounds. David Mazières and the protocol team explained how tracking the last ledger/time at which an account’s sequence number changed can unlock relative timelocks, queue recovery tools, and payment-channel safety guarantees that Stellar previously lacked.

Key discussion threads:

- How generalized preconditions turn sequence numbers, ledgers, and time into explicit requirements, letting transactions declare “only valid after my account has been idle for N ledgers/seconds.”
- Payment-channel patterns built on top: “disclose then finalize” flows, dispute windows, and unilateral recovery when a counterparty disappears without forcing everyone to double their timelocks.
- Additional use cases like time-delayed queue recovery, multisig workflows, and cross-chain interoperability where relative timelocks provide simpler security than today’s absolute timebounds.
