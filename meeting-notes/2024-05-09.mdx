1. Tyler built a voting application using passkeys to sign the transaction, which is an implementation of the secp256r1 verification function.
2. He showed a cross-platform implementation (web and mobile) and demonstrated that passkeys are the perfect interface between web3 contracts and web2 authentication mechanisms that most end users are accostomed to.
3. Ecosystem members discussed the use of smart wallets that would use passkeys as a signer. Challenges were identified around fees requires for smart wallets, the need for a common implementation for a smart wallet, as well as how might it interface with existing password managers.
4. The voting application can be tried out at [passkey.sorobanbyexample.org/](https://passkey.sorobanbyexample.org/)
5. Code for the demo is here [github.com/kalepail/soroban-passkey](https://github.com/kalepail/soroban-passkey)
