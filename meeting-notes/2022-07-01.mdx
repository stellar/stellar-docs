This design review revolved around one question: should Soroban expose classic assets through a dual-balance model (trustline plus contract balance) or collapse them into a single ledger entry? The team walked through the requirements doc, comparing user experience, wallet complexity, reserve management, and storage patterns across both approaches.

Security and compliance dominated the second half. Contracts that touch trustlines inherit every approval that a user signed, so they brainstormed ways to keep allowances safe, detect malicious approvals, and decide whether contracts should maintain trustlines at all. The discussion set up the deeper July work on asset representation and wrappers.

Key discussion threads:

- Benefits of the single balance approach-one canonical trustline that doubles as a Soroban token view so wallets only look in one place.
- Performance and reserve costs raised by the dual-balance camp, especially when allowances span multiple ledger entries.
- Safety implications of letting contracts pull directly from trustlines and mitigations such as scoped approvals or account compartmentalization.
