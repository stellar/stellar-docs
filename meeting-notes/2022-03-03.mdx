With CAP-0042 nearly ready for submission, the group walked through the last edits needed to land multi-part transaction sets. That meant clarifying how wallets should react when a lane fills, how fee bumps interplay with the new bidding model, and what validators must publish so ecosystem tooling can warn users before a submission is dropped.

The second half returned to CAP-0044 (SpeeDEX configuration). Engineers compared the theoretical parameters in the CAP to the real data that aggregators will feed into Stellar Core, and they cataloged the logging and analytics validators will need in order to tune those numbers after a rollout.

Key discussion threads:

- Updating wallet playbooks: when to re-sign versus fee-bump a transaction once lane-specific rejection reasons start surfacing.
- Telemetry and alerting that validators should expose so SDF and ecosystem operators can detect stuck or unhealthy fee lanes.
- How much of the SpeeDEX configuration must be surfaced through Horizon so market operators and SDKs can preflight orders before submission.
