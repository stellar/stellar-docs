In this meeting the Nomyx team will give us an introduction to their advanced smart contract architecture (an implementation of the Diamond Pattern) and the Nomyx Diamond proxy viewer interface, that facilitates inspection of deployed diamonds and makes them a bit easier to work with.

They will also be showcasing a live deployment instance of the diamond proxy standard currently used for the Nomyx platform which removes limitations related to the upper contract size limit, allowing developers to launch complex products.
