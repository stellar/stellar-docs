<b>Part1</b><br />
The dev team behind Reflector and Refractor presents their tools for decentralized finance and transaction management on Stellar. Reflector delivers on-chain price feeds to enhance DeFi protocols, while Refractor provides a pending transaction storage and multisig aggregator for coordinated signing. They’ll cover how these products support trustless financial interactions and improve smart contract execution on Stellar.
