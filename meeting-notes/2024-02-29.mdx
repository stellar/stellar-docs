1. Tommaso (@tdep) proposed a core change to allow for extending instance and code TTL with separate values on the host environment to allow for more cost-efficient designs
   a. Proposal and discussion are captured in github discussions [stellar-core#1447](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1447)
2. Tommaso receieved feedback on the proposal as well as implementation. Since it didn't require a metering change, core devs thought it to be a quick change. 
3. The ecosystem voted in favor of the proposal by upvoting the post on Github Discussions. 13 votes were [recorded](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/).
4. As next steps, a CAP will be authored to capture the proposal and put forth for approval from CAP Core Team.
