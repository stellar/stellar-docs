_Note_: The hosts microphone audio is not in the video so there is some silence during Q/A. 
Here are the question asked during the Q/A:

1. (From ! markus_0) why do you always have an infinite amount of tokens in the pool? Wouldn't it be safer to start small and mint more as demand opens up
2.(From HunterIonize) What purpose does this serve exactly? Sorry to be blunt
3. How do you see the Orbit Protocol contributing to financial inclusion on a global scale, particularly in underbanked regions? What challenges do you anticipate in achieving this?
4. In 5-10 years, how do you see the landscape of Forex on blockchain evolving? What role do you believe Stellar will play in this evolution, and how will Blend and Orbit Protocol be at the forefront?
5. Are there any asks of the developer community?
