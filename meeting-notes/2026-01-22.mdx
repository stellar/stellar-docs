## Protocol Discussion

We had three CAPs prepared for this meeting. CAP-77 will provide a way to make ledger keys inaccessible based on the network configuration upgrade performed with a validator vote. CAP-78 proposes an interface which allows developers to specify TTL extension policies such as 'if an entry TTL is less than 29 days, extend it to have 30 days TTL'. CAP-79 introduces host functions for converting Stellar strkey format strings to/from Address/MuxedAddress objects.
