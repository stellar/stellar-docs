Alongside quick updates to CAP-0046 and CAP-0047, the team unveiled CAP-0050: the contract invocation transaction. The proposal rethinks how Stellar tracks ownership when a contract moves funds, introducing an `invoke contract` envelope that nests a Soroban-specific signature (the invoker) inside the usual decorated signatures. That allows developers to adopt an Ethereum-like `message.sender` model while preserving the classic account guarantees validators expect.

Discussion centered on the account model shift. Separating a contract invoker from the outer source account unlocks reusable signers, multi-party approvals, and delegated execution, but it also raises questions about aliasing, replay protection, and how CAP-0050 should behave when it calls other CAP-0049 asset adapters. Those trade-offs need to be nailed down before wallets can expose the new flows.

Key discussion threads:

- Anatomy of the `invoke contract` transaction and how its nested signature gives contracts a stable `get_invoker` primitive.
- How aliasing and delegation work when the transaction source differs from the runtime invoker, especially for contracts touching classic accounts.
- Replay prevention, signature reuse, and compatibility between CAP-0050 and the asset-interoperability work happening in CAP-0048/49.
