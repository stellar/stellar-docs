This was the final checkpoint for CAP-0021 (generalized transaction preconditions) before the CAP committee vote. After reminding everyone about the Protocol 18 upgrade window, the call covered remaining implementation questions, the interaction with CAP-0040, and how quickly the ecosystem should expect payment-channel tooling to arrive once the cap lands in Core.

Key discussion threads:

- Implementation effort: Stellar Core still needs overlay, testing, and Horizon queue updates, but the functionality itself is scoped and on par with other “medium” protocol changes.
- Ecosystem appetite: payment channels unlock higher-throughput use cases and new recovery flows, so landing CAP-0021 together with CAP-0040 acts as an insurance policy if a high-volume app suddenly needs them.
- Next steps: push both caps to the committee, continue performance experiments (e.g., single-message channels) in parallel, and use Meridian sessions to socialize concrete payment-channel designs with builders.
