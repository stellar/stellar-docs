Jump Cannon dominated this protocol call. The team dug into how CAP-0048 and CAP-0049 should let classic assets flow through Soroban contracts without weakening the compliance guarantees that anchors rely on. Most of the debate focused on the tradeoffs between usability and safety when issuers revoke authorization, freeze trustlines, or claw back balances that a contract is holding on behalf of users.

Key discussion threads:

- How issuers can chase funds through downstream contracts when a participant attempts to dodge KYC freezes, and whether that burden should fall on protocol defaults or on contract-specific guard rails.
- Implications of mutable vs. immutable Soroban contracts, and whether developers must implement cleanup hooks so that clawbacks and freezes do not permanently brick liquidity pools.
- Ideas for gating “dangerous” assets (auth required, clawback enabled, etc.) until a future phase, while the group gains confidence in interoperability patterns between classic accounts and contracts.
