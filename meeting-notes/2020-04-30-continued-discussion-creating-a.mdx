Lisa Nestor reconvened Tempo, Cowrie, SatoshiPay, Inclusive, and SDF to lock down the “direct send” SEP. She recapped how SEPs formalize cross-border use cases and framed this spec as the missing piece for fiat-to-fiat payments where the receiver simply wants money in a bank account.

Claudio from Inclusive then detailed a multilateral KYC service so anchors can share due-diligence data (even across strict EU/Japan regimes) without re-running every check. The roundtable closed with the technical plan for letting noncustodial wallets trigger these payments—SEP-10 whitelisting, tokenized memos, and how anchors can accept flows initiated by apps such as SatoshiPay.

Key discussion threads:

- Scope of the direct send SEP and how it extends SEP-6/24/10 to support anchor-to-anchor remittances where receivers never touch a wallet.
- Inclusive’s “EDD Connect” concept: sharing KYC/KYB results, handling consent and data privacy, and giving smaller anchors access to compliant onboarding.
- Requirements for noncustodial initiators: registering wallet keys, using SEP-10 auth, handling memos and transaction statuses, and preserving anchor control over compliance.
