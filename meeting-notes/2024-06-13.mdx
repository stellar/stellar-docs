1. Tyler created Super Peach, a web3 application that uses passkeys to sign transactions. He demonstrated how passkeys can be used in authorization flows and how they can be used to sign transactions.
   - Code: https://github.com/kalepail/superpeach
   - Demo: https://superpeach.vercel.app
2. Introduced `passkey-kit`. A TypeScript SDK for creating and managing Smart Wallets via passkeys (includes the actual [Smart Wallet interface](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit/tree/main/contracts))
   - Code: https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit
   - Demo: https://passkey-kit-demo.pages.dev
3. Introduced Launchtube, a service for submitting transactions onchain by covering both the transaction fee AND the sequence number. Wild!
   - Code: https://github.com/kalepail/launchtube (ask in the `#passkeys` channel on Discord for a testnet token)
4. He shared his vision for pushing the passkey implementation through to becoming a [standard for the ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_Wom6eK1UpC3E7VuQZfOBCLc2d5lvqAhMN7VPieMBQ/edit).
