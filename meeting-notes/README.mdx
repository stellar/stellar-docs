Welcome to the archive of public Stellar meetings. This section collects recordings and notes so you can watch key discussions and follow along at your own pace.

Each meeting page corresponds to a single call (typically one week’s session) and includes an embedded recording plus a short written summary and links.

## Soroban Smart Contracts Playlist

Many of the meetings here are also part of a broader **Soroban smart contracts** playlist on YouTube. These include:

- **Soroban Design Discussions** – deep dives into the design of Soroban smart contracts, including authorization models, host functions, and platform capabilities.
- **Soroban Talks** – shorter, focused sessions on topics like setting up a local dev environment, SDKs, DAOs on Soroban, and practical building tips.
- **Feature spotlights** – sessions such as *Single Balance vs. Double Balance Showdown* and *Project Jump Cannon Q&A*, which explore specific design trade‑offs and new capabilities.

If you prefer to watch straight from YouTube, look for the Soroban playlist linked from the video descriptions; if you prefer to read along, the corresponding notes live in the 2022–2023 date range in this archive.

## Developer Design Discussions

The **Stellar Developer Meeting** series (primarily 2024 and later) focuses on:

- Live demos of tools and dapps building on Stellar and Soroban.
- Deep‑dive design conversations with ecosystem teams (for example, OpenZeppelin, Dob Protocol, PaltaLabs).
- Walkthroughs of new features such as UI builders, monitoring tools, and upgraded developer workflows.

Browsing the most recent dates is a good way to see what builders in the ecosystem are working on right now and learn how they approach contract architecture, security, and UX.

## Open Protocol Discussions (Legacy)

Older entries in this archive are **Open Protocol Discussions**. These calls pre‑date Soroban and focus on the evolution of the Stellar protocol itself:

- Review and debate of Core Advancement Proposals (CAPs).
- Changes to consensus, ledger behavior, and core network features.
- Historical context for why the protocol behaves the way it does today.

If you are interested in the “why” behind Stellar’s core design choices, exploring the 2021–2022 meetings provides valuable background and links out to the relevant CAP documents.
