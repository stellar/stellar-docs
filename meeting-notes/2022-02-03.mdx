CAP-0042 dominated this meeting. The team dug into multi-part transaction sets as a way to carve the ledger into explicit fee lanes so validators can shield everyday payments from arbitrage spikes. They worked through examples showing how a SpeeDEX-specific lane or an arbitrage lane could pay its own equilibrium fee without contaminating baseline throughput.

From there the conversation moved to operations. Validators need clear guard rails for how much capacity each lane can occupy, what telemetry they should export, and how to keep wildly failing bots from hogging attention. The group outlined the docs Horizon and wallets will need so users understand which lane a submission will land in and what bidding rules apply.

Key discussion threads:

- Drafting example lane layouts (baseline payments, arbitrage clean-up, SpeeDEX) and deciding how validators advertise the mix they support.
- Techniques for spotting repeated failed arbitrage loops and deciding when validators may quarantine a fee source before it wastes an entire ledger.
- Operational tooling for operators-config knobs, logging, and documentation-so ecosystem wallets can aim at the right lane and predict the fees they should bid.
