This Jump Cannon kickoff focused on CAP-0046, the Wasm smart-contract runtime vocabulary. Grzegorz and the core team explained why the CAP looks unusual: it introduces the types, host objects, and XDR scaffolding that Soroban will lean on without yet wiring them into any user-facing transaction. Establishing that common language now keeps the follow-on caps smaller and lets client teams prototype against a stable ABI.

They also unpacked the host/guest split, detailing how contracts run in a deterministic guest environment while Stellar Core enforces resource limits, storage access, and serialization in the host. That discussion covered the value type hierarchy, how immutable objects flow across the boundary, and why the data model needs to be generic enough for future fee schedule updates.

Key discussion threads:

- CAP-0046 as a building block: defining XDR for Wasm entries, handles, and host functions while deferring transaction plumbing to later caps.
- The host-versus-guest contract boundary and how deterministic execution depends on a clear line between developer code and Stellar Core.
- Structuring SCVal and companion types so contracts can exchange complex data without breaking compatibility with existing ledger serialization rules.
