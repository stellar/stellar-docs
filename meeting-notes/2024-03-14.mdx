3. Proposals discussed:

  b. [CAP-53](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0053.md): create separate functions for extending the time-to-live for contract instance and contract code; by @tdep  
  c. [CAP-54](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0054.md): lower total costs by refining the Soroban cost model used for VM instantiation into multiple separate and more-accurate costs; by @graydon  
  d. [CAP-55](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0055.md): lower total costs by linking fewer host functions during VM instantiation in Soroban; by @graydon  
  e. [CAP-56](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0056.md): lower total costs by caching parsed Wasm modules within a Soroban transaction; by @graydon
