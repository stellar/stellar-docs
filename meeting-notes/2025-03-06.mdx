In this meeting we have a conversation with Christian Santagata from OpenZeppelin about the Stellar x OpenZeppelin multi-year partnership, and talk about what the team is working on in the Stellar ecosystem. The conversation includes topics about Stellar token contracts and token standards, and how to use the OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard that now supports Stellar contracts.
