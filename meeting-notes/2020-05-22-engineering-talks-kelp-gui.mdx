On May 22, 2020, the Stellar Development Foundation hosted "Engineering Talks - Kelp GUI", a talk for the global community. Builders traded notes on Engineering, Talks, and Kelp.

Today we're going to be talking about the Kelp GUI where anyone can create crypto. My name is Nicholas Har and I'm one of the developers for the Stellar Development Foundation. We're going to go over what is kelp, what is a Kelp GUI version one.

Key discussion threads:

- Engineering anchored the talk as speakers compared real-world examples.
- Practical demos highlighted how Talks applies to Stellar builders.
- Attendees outlined next steps around Kelp for upcoming releases.
