Piyal from Freighter discussed the proposal to standardize the wallet interface. Key points from the discussion are captured below. For full notes, please view the recording; and also refer to the proposal and the post on github discussions.

1. [The draft proposal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/83191be659166e05f8df1257c6f655de9d1afe63/ecosystem/sep-0043.md)
2. [Ongoing discussion](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1467)
3. Requiring the network passphrase might be uneeded complexity.
4. Both WalletConnect and mobile wallets likely have significant differences than the proposed interface (which is targetted at browser extension wallets); and thus likely require a separate SEP. The said SEPs should be created by teams working on wallet integration with the said platforms.
5. What is the role of the Stellar Wallet Kit in the ecosystem and how does it play with the standard itself?
6. As next steps, Piyal will incorporate the suggestions from the ecosystem into the proposal.
