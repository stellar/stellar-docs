Lee McCulloch framed Stellar’s key model (master key, signers, weights) and the UX pitfalls facing wallets that expect users to write down secret phrases or trust a server. SEP-30 “Recoverysigner” is his answer: a standard API that lets wallets register recovery identities (phone/email) with two independent services while keeping device keys local.

He walked through Alice’s lifecycle: generate a master key, derive a device key, register two recovery signers, delete the master key, and later regain account control on a new device by authenticating to both services. Because the recovery providers only co-sign transactions, Alice keeps full custody but gets a consumer-grade onboarding and recovery flow.

Key discussion threads:

- Recap of master keys vs. signers and how most wallets handle backups today (paper phrases, encrypted server storage).
- SEP-30 registration: wallet authenticates via SEP-10, sets identities, and adds two recovery signers with limited weights.
- Recovery flow: new device key, request co-signatures via phone/email, revoke the lost device—no new Stellar account needed.
- Benefits: familiar UX, multi-device support, optional recovery phrases, and no single server with unilateral control.

hi everyone welcome to the stellar development foundations engineering talk series my name is Lee McCulloch and I'm a software engineer at the foundation I'm one of the people working on improving the experience that individuals have using stellar and the businesses have building on still and today I'm talking about stellar ecosystem proposal 30 sep 30 is an approach to make still a key management user-friendly in products built on stellar so a user friendly team andr is maybe
