1.  There's a discussion on a TX meta change increasing visibility and analytics within the Stellar network. (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/pull/175)
2.  Read-only invocations for contracts is explained, focusing on ensuring certain functions remain read-only without side effects. (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1454) (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1456) (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1464)
3.  Enabling contract discovery is introduced to enhance the visibility and authenticity of smart contracts within the Stellar ecosystem.
4.  The implementation of a standardized contract meta data schema is proposed to link contracts to source code and enhance contract discoverability.(https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/latest/soroban_sdk/macro.contractmeta.html)
5.  Issues related to inclusion fees in the Stellar network, highlighting the importance of monitoring fees closely and understanding the implications of surge pricing. (https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/smart-contract-internals/fees-and-metering#transaction-fee)
