Two weeks later the group revisited CAP-0042 with its updated language and run-time examples. They stress-tested how validators will toggle fee policies per lane, what happens to transactions that do not fit a published policy, and how the new wording avoids starvation while still letting arbitrageurs bid independently.

They also kicked off a first look at CAP-0044 (SpeeDEX configuration) and walked through the Core Advancement Proposal life cycle so the community knows when CAP-0021 and CAP-0040 will enter final comment ahead of Protocol 19. That schedule matters to downstream operators who need to update horizon, SDKs, and dashboards before the new fee plumbing goes live.

Key discussion threads:

- Ensuring the revised CAP-0042 text gives validators clear discretion over which policy to apply to each lane without fragmenting mempools.
- Mapping out how a SpeeDEX lane will be parameterized in CAP-0044 so aggregators can predict how much order flow they may submit each ledger.
- Communicating the final-comment windows for CAP-0021 and CAP-0040 (both targeting Protocol 19) so implementers know when the specs freeze.
