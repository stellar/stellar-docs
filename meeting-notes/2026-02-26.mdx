## Protocol Discussion

In this protocol meeting we had two CAPs to discuss and that was CAP-81 and CAP-82.

CAP-81: This CAP introduces a simpler and more efficient eviction scan process. Instead of scanning the BucketList, the new eviction scan just uses in-memory Soroban state. This simplifies the logic while reducing disk reads and speeding up eviction speed.

CAP-82: This CAP adds checked variants of the existing 256-bit integer arithmetic host functions. Unlike the existing functions which trap on overflow, the checked variants return Void on overflow, allowing contracts to handle arithmetic errors gracefully.
