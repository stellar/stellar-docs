## Enable Stellar Authentication via SEP-10

Stellar-based wallet applications create authenticated sessions with Stellar anchors by proving they, or their users, have sufficient control over a Stellar account. Once authenticated, the wallet application uses a session token provided by the anchor in subsequent requests to the anchor's standardized services.

The Anchor Platform supports this form of authentication with minimal configuration from the business.

<CodeExample>
```bash
# dev.env
SEP10_ENABLED=true
SEP10_HOME_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED="a Stellar private key"
SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET="a secret encryption key"
```
</CodeExample>

`SEP_10_HOME_DOMAIN` is the `home_domain` property used by [sep-10]. The configuration value must be equal to the host of the toml file. If you are hosting toml file via the Platform, (`SEP1_ENABLED` is set to `true`), toml file will be hosted on the SEP server.

`SECRET_SEP10_SIGNING_SEED` is the private key to the public key you've specified as the `SIGNING_KEY` in your `stellar.toml` file. It will be used to sign authentication challenges presented to wallet applications, providing that you are in possession of the `SIGNING_KEY`. Wallets will check for this signature before signing and sending back the authentication challenge.

`SECRET_SEP10_JWT_SECRET` is the encryption key that will be used to sign and verify the authentication tokens you issue to wallet applications after they or their users have proven control of their Stellar account.

## Enable Stellar Authentication via SEP-45
The Anchor Platform also supports passkey authentication via SEP-45. The details of SEP-45 can be found [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0045.md).

<CodeExample>
```bash
# dev.env
SEP45_ENABLED=true
SEP45_WEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
SEP45_WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID=[Your Contract ID]
```
</CodeExample>

Regarding how to create the contract for your SEP-45 passkey authentication, please refer to the [SEP-45 document](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0045.md#web-authentication-contract). 

:::info
To enable SEP-45 (passkey authentication), the RPC connection must be configured. For detailed instructions on configuring the RPC connection, please refer to the [RPC Configuration Guide](../getting-started.mdx).

## Config With Client Attribution
If you are using SEP-10 for authentication, by default, the Anchor Platform allows anyone with a Stellar account to authenticate with your services. If you'd like to only allow users of a particular wallet application to authenticate, or want to disallow specific users from authenticating, use the following environment variables. This is an optional feature and should only be added if it is a business requirement.

`SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED` informs the Anchor Platform whether it should allow users of noncustodial wallets to authenticate without the wallet also identifying itself.

`CLIENTS` is the list of outside wallet servers or clients for the Anchor server to safely communicate with.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED=true
```

</CodeExample>

<CodeExample>

```yaml
clients:
  # Each item in the list may contain the following fields:
  #   - name: (required) the name of the client
  #   - type: (required) `custodial` or `noncustodial`
  #
  #   If the type is `custodial`,
  #   - signing_keys: (required) the custodial SEP-10 signing key of the client.
  #   - callback_urls.sep6: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-6 callback API endpoint.
  #   - callback_urls.sep24: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-24 callback API endpoint.
  #   - callback_urls.sep31: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-31 callback API endpoint.
  #   - callback_urls.sep12: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-10 callback API endpoint.
  #   - allow_any_destination: (optional) default to false. If set to true, allows any destination for deposits.
  #   - destination_accounts: (optional) list of accounts allowed to be used for the deposit.
  #                           If allows_any_destinations set to true, this configuration option is ignored.
  #
  #   If the type is `noncustodial`,
  #   - domains: (required) the domains of the client.
  #   - callback_urls.sep6: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-6 callback API endpoint.
  #   - callback_urls.sep24: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-24 callback API endpoint.
  #   - callback_urls.sep31: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-31 callback API endpoint.
  #   - callback_urls.sep12: (optional) the URL of the client's SEP-10 callback API endpoint.

  # custodial client
  - name: custodial-client1
    type: custodial
    signing_keys: "the signing key 1 of the client1","the signing key 2 of the client1"
    callback_urls:
      sep6: https://callback.custodial-client1.com/api/v1/anchor/callback/sep6
      sep12: https://callback.custodial-client1.com/api/v1/anchor/callback/sep12
    allow_any_destination: false
    destination_accounts: destAccount1,destAccount2

  # noncustodial client
  - name: noncustodial-client1
    type: noncustodial
    domains: noncustodial-client1.co,noncustodial-client1.com
    callback_urls:
      sep6: https://callback.noncustodial-client1.co/api/v2/anchor/callback/sep6

`SEP10_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED` informs the Anchor Platform whether it should allow users of noncustodial wallets to authenticate without the wallet also identifying itself.

`CLIENTS` is the list of outside wallet servers or clients for the Anchor server to safely communicate with.

## Modify a Stellar Info File

Next, let's modify `stellar.toml` file created [earlier][sep1-ap]. Wallets need to know that SEP-10 functionality is supported by your business.

<CodeExample>

```toml
# dev.stellar.toml
ACCOUNTS = ["add your public keys for your distribution accounts here"]
SIGNING_KEY = "add your signing key here"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/auth"

# If SEP-45 is enabled, add the following
WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/sep45/auth"

[DOCUMENTATION]
ORG_NAME = "Your organization"
ORG_URL = "Your website"
ORG_DESCRIPTION = "A description of your organization"
```

</CodeExample>

[sep1-ap]: ../sep1/README.mdx
