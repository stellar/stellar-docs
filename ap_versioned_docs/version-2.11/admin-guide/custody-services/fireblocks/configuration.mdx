  fireblocks:

    # Fireblocks public key that is used to verify a webhook signature
    public_key: "public_key"
    # Mappings of fireblocks asset codes to stellar asset codes. For example:
    # XLM_USDC_T_CEKS stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5
    # XLM_TEST stellar:native
    # Codes should be separated with a space and each pair of codes should be on a new line
    asset_mappings: "asset_mappings"
    reconciliation:
      # Cron expression which defines how often the transaction reconciliation job runs.
      # By default, job runs every 15 minutes.
      # Default value: 0 0/15 * * * *
      cron_expression: "0 0/15 * * * *"
