:::tip

It's possible to provide multiple updates in a single JSON-RPC request (by placing multiple JSON-RPC request objects). When an update is done in this way, all updates will be done sequentially.

Most importantly, each JSON-RPC request is not atomic. If one update fails, all previous updates WILL be applied and all subsequent updates WILL be processed and applied as well.
