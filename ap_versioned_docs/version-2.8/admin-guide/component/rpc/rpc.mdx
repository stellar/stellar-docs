Before making JSON-RPC requests, let's first create a template for making a request to the Anchor Platform.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# call-json-rpc.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

curl localhost:8085 \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data "@$1"
```

</CodeExample>

This small script will make a JSON-RPC request to the Anchor Platform hosted on the default port (8085). JSON transaction data stored in the provided file will be used as body (requests must be an array).
