### How To Use JWTs?

As part of the flow, once a user makes a request, i.e. an interactive withdrawal/deposit request, it will be processed by the Anchor Platform and forwarded to your service. The Anchor Platform will make a `GET` call to `<configured url>?token=<jwt token>`.

This JWT token will contain:

1. `exp` is the expiration time of the token. You should check that the provided token has not expired.
2. `sub` is the account associated with this transaction. It can be used to identify the user account. Note that this value may be different from the account that will be used to receive/send funds.
3. `jti` is the hash of the transaction.
4. `data` is the extra payload that has been set by the user. It will always contain the Stellar `asset` wants to deposit or withdraw. If provided by the client, it will also contain the `amount` the user wants to transact, the `client_domain` of the wallet verified during SEP-10 authentication, and `client_name` (defined as 'name' in [clients] configuration if provided), and the `lang` (language) preference of the user.

### How To Provide Fees?

Currently, it's recommended to provide fees/exchange rates in the iFrame/web view of your application.

[SEP-24] standard provides a `/fee` endpoint to allow businesses to set static fees for their transactions. However, it's not currently supported by the Anchor Platform.

:::note

/fee endpoint will be deprecated in the future.

### How to identify the user account?

You should use the `sub` field of the JWT token. For custodial wallets, this value will be in the format `account:memo`. Use the memo to identity the user. For noncustodial wallets, simply use the `sub` value itself, which will be equal to the user account.

### How to identify the wallet?

Utilize the `data.client_domain` attributes within the JWT token. In the presence of [clients] configuration, the JWT token will additionally incorporate the `data.client_name` field, enabling wallet identification.
