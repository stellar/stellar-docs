Anchor Platform provides an event service that sends HTTP webhook notifications to:

**Business Servers**

- Transaction status changes
- Quote updates
- Customer KYC status changes

Event schemas for business servers are defined in the [API reference](/platforms/anchor-platform/next/api-reference/callbacks/post-event).

**Client Applications**

- Transaction status changes affecting their users
- Customer KYC status changes affecting their users

_Event schemas for client applications are defined in their respective SEPs:_

- [SEP-6 Transaction Events](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#single-historical-transaction)
- [SEP-12 Customer Events](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md#response)
- [SEP-24 Transaction Events](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#single-historical-transaction)
- [SEP-31 Transaction Events](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0031.md#get-transaction)

This eliminates the need for business servers and client applications to continuously poll the APIs for updates.
