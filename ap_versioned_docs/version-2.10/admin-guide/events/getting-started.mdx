Anchor Platform provides an event service that allows your business application and client applications such as wallets to receive updates about transaction updates via HTTP webhooks without the need to poll the transactions API.

By integrating with the event service, you or your clients will be able to receive updates about the status of transactions, including when they are submitted, completed, and failed as well as any quotes created.
